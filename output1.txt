CHAPTER O
I O
Emma O
Woodhouse, O
handsome, O
clever, O
and O
rich, O
with O
a O
comfortable O
home O
and O
happy O
disposition, O
seemed O
to O
unite O
some O
of O
the O
best O
blessings O
of O
existence; O
and O
had O
lived O
nearly O
twenty-one O
years O
in O
the O
world O
with O
very O
little O
to O
distress O
or O
vex O
her. O
She O
was O
the O
youngest O
of O
the O
two O
daughters O
of O
a O
most O
affectionate, O
indulgent O
father; O
and O
had, O
in O
consequence O
of O
her O
sister's O
marriage, O
been O
mistress O
of O
his O
house O
from O
a O
very O
early O
period. O
 O
Her O
mother O
had O
died O
too O
long O
ago O
for O
her O
to O
have O
more O
than O
an O
indistinct O
remembrance O
of O
her O
caresses; O
and O
her O
place O
had O
been O
supplied O
by O
an O
excellent O
woman O
as O
governess, O
who O
had O
fallen O
little O
short O
of O
a O
mother O
in O
affection. O
Sixteen O
years O
had O
Miss O
Taylor O
been O
in O
Mr. O
Woodhouse's O
family, O
less O
as O
a O
governess O
than O
a O
friend, O
very O
fond O
of O
both O
daughters, O
but O
particularly O
of O
Emma. O
 O
Between O
them O
it O
was O
more O
the O
intimacy O
of O
sisters. O
 O
Even O
before O
Miss O
Taylor O
had O
ceased O
to O
hold O
the O
nominal O
office O
of O
governess, O
the O
mildness O
of O
her O
temper O
had O
hardly O
allowed O
her O
to O
impose O
any O
restraint; O
and O
the O
shadow O
of O
authority O
being O
now O
long O
passed O
away, O
they O
had O
been O
living O
together O
as O
friend O
and O
friend O
very O
mutually O
attached, O
and O
Emma O
doing O
just O
what O
she O
liked; O
highly O
esteeming O
Miss O
Taylor's O
judgment, O
but O
directed O
chiefly O
by O
her O
own. O
The O
real O
evils, O
indeed, O
of O
Emma's O
situation O
were O
the O
power O
of O
having O
rather O
too O
much O
her O
own O
way, O
and O
a O
disposition O
to O
think O
a O
little O
too O
well O
of O
herself; O
these O
were O
the O
disadvantages O
which O
threatened O
alloy O
to O
her O
many O
enjoyments. O
 O
The O
danger, O
however, O
was O
at O
present O
so O
unperceived, O
that O
they O
did O
not O
by O
any O
means O
rank O
as O
misfortunes O
with O
her. O
Sorrow O
came--a O
gentle O
sorrow-- O
but O
not O
at O
all O
in O
the O
shape O
of O
any O
disagreeable O
consciousness.-- O
Miss O
Taylor O
married. O
 O
It O
was O
Miss O
Taylor's O
loss O
which O
first O
brought O
grief. O
 O
It O
was O
on O
the O
wedding-day O
of O
this O
beloved O
friend O
that O
Emma O
first O
sat O
in O
mournful O
thought O
of O
any O
continuance. O
 O
The O
wedding O
over, O
and O
the O
bride-people O
gone, O
her O
father O
and O
herself O
were O
left O
to O
dine O
together, O
with O
no O
prospect O
of O
a O
third O
to O
cheer O
a O
long O
evening. O
 O
Her O
father O
composed O
himself O
to O
sleep O
after O
dinner, O
as O
usual, O
and O
she O
had O
then O
only O
to O
sit O
and O
think O
of O
what O
she O
had O
lost. O
The O
event O
had O
every O
promise O
of O
happiness O
for O
her O
friend. O
 O
Mr. O
Weston O
was O
a O
man O
of O
unexceptionable O
character, O
easy O
fortune, O
suitable O
age, O
and O
pleasant O
manners; O
and O
there O
was O
some O
satisfaction O
in O
considering O
with O
what O
self-denying, O
generous O
friendship O
she O
had O
always O
wished O
and O
promoted O
the O
match; O
but O
it O
was O
a O
black O
morning's O
work O
for O
her. O
 O
The O
want O
of O
Miss O
Taylor O
would O
be O
felt O
every O
hour O
of O
every O
day. O
 O
She O
recalled O
her O
past O
kindness-- O
the O
kindness, O
the O
affection O
of O
sixteen O
years-- O
how O
she O
had O
taught O
and O
how O
she O
had O
played O
with O
her O
from O
five O
years O
old-- O
how O
she O
had O
devoted O
all O
her O
powers O
to O
attach O
and O
amuse O
her O
in O
health-- O
and O
how O
nursed O
her O
through O
the O
various O
illnesses O
of O
childhood. O
 O
A O
large O
debt O
of O
gratitude O
was O
owing O
here; O
but O
the O
intercourse O
of O
the O
last O
seven O
years, O
the O
equal O
footing O
and O
perfect O
unreserve O
which O
had O
soon O
followed O
Isabella's O
marriage, O
on O
their O
being O
left O
to O
each O
other, O
was O
yet O
a O
dearer, O
tenderer O
recollection. O
 O
She O
had O
been O
a O
friend O
and O
companion O
such O
as O
few O
possessed: O
intelligent, O
well-informed, O
useful, O
gentle, O
knowing O
all O
the O
ways O
of O
the O
family, O
interested O
in O
all O
its O
concerns, O
and O
peculiarly O
interested O
in O
herself, O
in O
every O
pleasure, O
every O
scheme O
of O
hers-- O
one O
to O
whom O
she O
could O
speak O
every O
thought O
as O
it O
arose, O
and O
who O
had O
such O
an O
affection O
for O
her O
as O
could O
never O
find O
fault. O
How O
was O
she O
to O
bear O
the O
change?-- O
It O
was O
true O
that O
her O
friend O
was O
going O
only O
half O
a O
mile O
from O
them; O
but O
Emma O
was O
aware O
that O
great O
must O
be O
the O
difference O
between O
a O
Mrs. O
Weston, O
only O
half O
a O
mile O
from O
them, O
and O
a O
Miss O
Taylor O
in O
the O
house; O
and O
with O
all O
her O
advantages, O
natural O
and O
domestic, O
she O
was O
now O
in O
great O
danger O
of O
suffering O
from O
intellectual O
solitude. O
 O
She O
dearly O
loved O
her O
father, O
but O
he O
was O
no O
companion O
for O
her. O
 O
He O
could O
not O
meet O
her O
in O
conversation, O
rational O
or O
playful. O
The O
evil O
of O
the O
actual O
disparity O
in O
their O
ages O
(and O
Mr. O
Woodhouse O
had O
not O
married O
early) O
was O
much O
increased O
by O
his O
constitution O
and O
habits; O
for O
having O
been O
a O
valetudinarian O
all O
his O
life, O
without O
activity O
of O
mind O
or O
body, O
he O
was O
a O
much O
older O
man O
in O
ways O
than O
in O
years; O
and O
though O
everywhere O
beloved O
for O
the O
friendliness O
of O
his O
heart O
and O
his O
amiable O
temper, O
his O
talents O
could O
not O
have O
recommended O
him O
at O
any O
time. O
Her O
sister, O
though O
comparatively O
but O
little O
removed O
by O
matrimony, O
being O
settled O
in O
London, O
only O
sixteen O
miles O
off, O
was O
much O
beyond O
her O
daily O
reach; O
and O
many O
a O
long O
October O
and O
November O
evening O
must O
be O
struggled O
through O
at O
Hartfield, O
before O
Christmas O
brought O
the O
next O
visit O
from O
Isabella O
and O
her O
husband, O
and O
their O
little O
children, O
to O
fill O
the O
house, O
and O
give O
her O
pleasant O
society O
again. O
Highbury, O
the O
large O
and O
populous O
village, O
almost O
amounting O
to O
a O
town, O
to O
which O
Hartfield, O
in O
spite O
of O
its O
separate O
lawn, O
and O
shrubberies, O
and O
name, O
did O
really O
belong, O
afforded O
her O
no O
equals. O
 O
The O
Woodhouses O
were O
first O
in O
consequence O
there. O
 O
All O
looked O
up O
to O
them. O
 O
She O
had O
many O
acquaintance O
in O
the O
place, O
for O
her O
father O
was O
universally O
civil, O
but O
not O
one O
among O
them O
who O
could O
be O
accepted O
in O
lieu O
of O
Miss O
Taylor O
for O
even O
half O
a O
day. O
 O
It O
was O
a O
melancholy O
change; O
and O
Emma O
could O
not O
but O
sigh O
over O
it, O
and O
wish O
for O
impossible O
things, O
till O
her O
father O
awoke, O
and O
made O
it O
necessary O
to O
be O
cheerful. O
 O
His O
spirits O
required O
support. O
He O
was O
a O
nervous O
man, O
easily O
depressed; O
fond O
of O
every O
body O
that O
he O
was O
used O
to, O
and O
hating O
to O
part O
with O
them; O
hating O
change O
of O
every O
kind. O
Matrimony, O
as O
the O
origin O
of O
change, O
was O
always O
disagreeable; O
and O
he O
was O
by O
no O
means O
yet O
reconciled O
to O
his O
own O
daughter's O
marrying, O
nor O
could O
ever O
speak O
of O
her O
but O
with O
compassion, O
though O
it O
had O
been O
entirely O
a O
match O
of O
affection, O
when O
he O
was O
now O
obliged O
to O
part O
with O
Miss O
Taylor O
too; O
and O
from O
his O
habits O
of O
gentle O
selfishness, O
and O
of O
being O
never O
able O
to O
suppose O
that O
other O
people O
could O
feel O
differently O
from O
himself, O
he O
was O
very O
much O
disposed O
to O
think O
Miss O
Taylor O
had O
done O
as O
sad O
a O
thing O
for O
herself O
as O
for O
them, O
and O
would O
have O
been O
a O
great O
deal O
happier O
if O
she O
had O
spent O
all O
the O
rest O
of O
her O
life O
at O
Hartfield. O
 O
Emma Entity
smiled O
and O
chatted O
as O
cheerfully O
as O
she O
could, O
to O
keep O
him O
from O
such O
thoughts; O
but O
when O
tea O
came, O
it O
was O
impossible O
for O
him O
not O
to O
say O
exactly O
as O
he Entity
had O
said Cue
at O
dinner, O
"Poor Quotation
Miss Quotation
Taylor!--I Quotation
wish Quotation
she Quotation
were Quotation
here Quotation
again. Quotation
 Quotation
What Quotation
a Quotation
pity Quotation
it Quotation
is Quotation
that Quotation
Mr. Quotation
Weston Quotation
ever Quotation
thought Quotation
of Quotation
her!" Quotation
"I Quotation
cannot Quotation
agree Quotation
with Quotation
you, Quotation
papa; Quotation
you Quotation
know Quotation
I Quotation
cannot. Quotation
 Quotation
Mr. Quotation
Weston Quotation
is Quotation
such Quotation
a Quotation
good-humoured, Quotation
pleasant, Quotation
excellent Quotation
man, Quotation
that Quotation
he Quotation
thoroughly Quotation
deserves Quotation
a Quotation
good Quotation
wife;-- Quotation
and Quotation
you Quotation
would Quotation
not Quotation
have Quotation
had Quotation
Miss Quotation
Taylor Quotation
live Quotation
with Quotation
us Quotation
for Quotation
ever, Quotation
and Quotation
bear Quotation
all Quotation
my Quotation
odd Quotation
humours, Quotation
when Quotation
she Quotation
might Quotation
have Quotation
a Quotation
house Quotation
of Quotation
her Quotation
own?" Quotation
"A Quotation
house Quotation
of Quotation
her Quotation
own!-- Quotation
But Quotation
where Quotation
is Quotation
the Quotation
advantage Quotation
of Quotation
a Quotation
house Quotation
of Quotation
her Quotation
own? Quotation
This Quotation
is Quotation
three Quotation
times Quotation
as Quotation
large.-- Quotation
And Quotation
you Quotation
have Quotation
never Quotation
any Quotation
odd Quotation
humours, Quotation
my Quotation
dear." Quotation
"How Quotation
often Quotation
we Quotation
shall Quotation
be Quotation
going Quotation
to Quotation
see Quotation
them, Quotation
and Quotation
they Quotation
coming Quotation
to Quotation
see Quotation
us!-- Quotation
We Quotation
shall Quotation
be Quotation
always Quotation
meeting! Quotation
We Quotation
must Quotation
begin; Quotation
we Quotation
must Quotation
go Quotation
and Quotation
pay Quotation
wedding Quotation
visit Quotation
very Quotation
soon." Quotation
"My Quotation
dear, Quotation
how Quotation
am Quotation
I Quotation
to Quotation
get Quotation
so Quotation
far? Quotation
Randalls Quotation
is Quotation
such Quotation
a Quotation
distance. Quotation
 Quotation
I Quotation
could Quotation
not Quotation
walk Quotation
half Quotation
so Quotation
far." Quotation
"No, Quotation
papa, Quotation
nobody Quotation
thought Quotation
of Quotation
your Quotation
walking. Quotation
 Quotation
We Quotation
must Quotation
go Quotation
in Quotation
the Quotation
carriage, Quotation
to Quotation
be Quotation
sure." Quotation
"The Quotation
carriage! Quotation
But Quotation
James Quotation
will Quotation
not Quotation
like Quotation
to Quotation
put Quotation
the Quotation
horses Quotation
to Quotation
for Quotation
such Quotation
a Quotation
little Quotation
way;-- Quotation
and Quotation
where Quotation
are Quotation
the Quotation
poor Quotation
horses Quotation
to Quotation
be Quotation
while Quotation
we Quotation
are Quotation
paying Quotation
our Quotation
visit?" Quotation
"They Quotation
are Quotation
to Quotation
be Quotation
put Quotation
into Quotation
Mr. Quotation
Weston's Quotation
stable, Quotation
papa. Quotation
 Quotation
You Quotation
know Quotation
we Quotation
have Quotation
settled Quotation
all Quotation
that Quotation
already. Quotation
 Quotation
We Quotation
talked Quotation
it Quotation
all Quotation
over Quotation
with Quotation
Mr. Quotation
Weston Quotation
last Quotation
night. Quotation
 Quotation
And Quotation
as Quotation
for Quotation
James, Quotation
you Quotation
may Quotation
be Quotation
very Quotation
sure Quotation
he Quotation
will Quotation
always Quotation
like Quotation
going Quotation
to Quotation
Randalls, Quotation
because Quotation
of Quotation
his Quotation
daughter's Quotation
being Quotation
housemaid Quotation
there. Quotation
 Quotation
I Quotation
only Quotation
doubt Quotation
whether Quotation
he Quotation
will Quotation
ever Quotation
take Quotation
us Quotation
anywhere Quotation
else. Quotation
 Quotation
That Quotation
was Quotation
your Quotation
doing, Quotation
papa. Quotation
 Quotation
You Quotation
got Quotation
Hannah Quotation
that Quotation
good Quotation
place. Quotation
 Quotation
Nobody Quotation
thought Quotation
of Quotation
Hannah Quotation
till Quotation
you Quotation
mentioned Quotation
her-- Quotation
James Quotation
is Quotation
so Quotation
obliged Quotation
to Quotation
you!" Quotation
"I Quotation
am Quotation
very Quotation
glad Quotation
I Quotation
did Quotation
think Quotation
of Quotation
her. Quotation
 Quotation
It Quotation
was Quotation
very Quotation
lucky, Quotation
for Quotation
I Quotation
would Quotation
not Quotation
have Quotation
had Quotation
poor Quotation
James Quotation
think Quotation
himself Quotation
slighted Quotation
upon Quotation
any Quotation
account; Quotation
and Quotation
I Quotation
am Quotation
sure Quotation
she Quotation
will Quotation
make Quotation
a Quotation
very Quotation
good Quotation
servant: Quotation
she Quotation
is Quotation
a Quotation
civil, Quotation
pretty-spoken Quotation
girl; Quotation
I Quotation
have Quotation
a Quotation
great Quotation
opinion Quotation
of Quotation
her. Quotation
 Quotation
Whenever Quotation
I Quotation
see Quotation
her, Quotation
she Quotation
always Quotation
curtseys Quotation
and Quotation
asks Quotation
me Quotation
how Quotation
I Quotation
do, Quotation
in Quotation
a Quotation
very Quotation
pretty Quotation
manner; Quotation
and Quotation
when Quotation
you Quotation
have Quotation
had Quotation
her Quotation
here Quotation
to Quotation
do Quotation
needlework, Quotation
I Quotation
observe Quotation
she Quotation
always Quotation
turns Quotation
the Quotation
lock Quotation
of Quotation
the Quotation
door Quotation
the Quotation
right Quotation
way Quotation
and Quotation
never Quotation
bangs Quotation
it. Quotation
 Quotation
I Quotation
am Quotation
sure Quotation
she Quotation
will Quotation
be Quotation
an Quotation
excellent Quotation
servant; Quotation
and Quotation
it Quotation
will Quotation
be Quotation
a Quotation
great Quotation
comfort Quotation
to Quotation
poor Quotation
Miss Quotation
Taylor Quotation
to Quotation
have Quotation
somebody Quotation
about Quotation
her Quotation
that Quotation
she Quotation
is Quotation
used Quotation
to Quotation
see. Quotation
 Quotation
Whenever Quotation
James Quotation
goes Quotation
over Quotation
to Quotation
see Quotation
his Quotation
daughter, Quotation
you Quotation
know, Quotation
she Quotation
will Quotation
be Quotation
hearing Quotation
of Quotation
us. Quotation
 Quotation
He Quotation
will Quotation
be Quotation
able Quotation
to Quotation
tell Quotation
her Quotation
how Quotation
we Quotation
all Quotation
are." Quotation
Emma O
spared O
no O
exertions O
to O
maintain O
this O
happier O
flow O
of O
ideas, O
and O
hoped, O
by O
the O
help O
of O
backgammon, O
to O
get O
her O
father O
tolerably O
through O
the O
evening, O
and O
be O
attacked O
by O
no O
regrets O
but O
her O
own. O
 O
The O
backgammon-table O
was O
placed; O
but O
a O
visitor O
immediately O
afterwards O
walked O
in O
and O
made O
it O
unnecessary. O
Mr. O
Knightley, O
a O
sensible O
man O
about O
seven O
or O
eight-and-thirty, O
was O
not O
only O
a O
very O
old O
and O
intimate O
friend O
of O
the O
family, O
but O
particularly O
connected O
with O
it, O
as O
the O
elder O
brother O
of O
Isabella's O
husband. O
 O
He O
lived O
about O
a O
mile O
from O
Highbury, O
was O
a O
frequent O
visitor, O
and O
always O
welcome, O
and O
at O
this O
time O
more O
welcome O
than O
usual, O
as O
coming O
directly O
from O
their O
mutual O
connexions O
in O
London. O
 O
He O
had O
returned O
to O
a O
late O
dinner, O
after O
some O
days' O
absence, O
and O
now O
walked O
up O
to O
Hartfield O
to O
say O
that O
all O
were O
well O
in O
Brunswick O
Square. O
 O
It O
was O
a O
happy O
circumstance, O
and O
animated O
Mr. O
Woodhouse O
for O
some O
time. O
 O
Mr. Entity
Knightley Entity
had O
a O
cheerful O
manner, O
which O
always O
did O
him O
good; O
and O
his O
many O
inquiries O
after O
"poor O
Isabella" O
and O
her O
children O
were O
answered O
most O
satisfactorily. O
 O
When O
this O
was O
over, O
Mr. Entity
Woodhouse Entity
gratefully O
observed, Cue
"It Quotation
is Quotation
very Quotation
kind Quotation
of Quotation
you, Quotation
Mr. Quotation
Knightley, Quotation
to Quotation
come Quotation
out Quotation
at Quotation
this Quotation
late Quotation
hour Quotation
to Quotation
call Quotation
upon Quotation
us. Quotation
 Quotation
I Quotation
am Quotation
afraid Quotation
you Quotation
must Quotation
have Quotation
had Quotation
a Quotation
shocking Quotation
walk." Quotation
"Not Quotation
at Quotation
all, Quotation
sir. Quotation
 Quotation
It Quotation
is Quotation
a Quotation
beautiful Quotation
moonlight Quotation
night; Quotation
and Quotation
so Quotation
mild Quotation
that Quotation
I Quotation
must Quotation
draw Quotation
back Quotation
from Quotation
your Quotation
great Quotation
fire." Quotation
"But Quotation
you Quotation
must Quotation
have Quotation
found Quotation
it Quotation
very Quotation
damp Quotation
and Quotation
dirty. Quotation
 Quotation
I Quotation
wish Quotation
you Quotation
may Quotation
not Quotation
catch Quotation
cold." Quotation
"Dirty, Quotation
sir! Quotation
Look Quotation
at Quotation
my Quotation
shoes. Quotation
 Quotation
Not Quotation
a Quotation
speck Quotation
on Quotation
them." Quotation
"Well! Quotation
that Quotation
is Quotation
quite Quotation
surprising, Quotation
for Quotation
we Quotation
have Quotation
had Quotation
a Quotation
vast Quotation
deal Quotation
of Quotation
rain Quotation
here. Quotation
 Quotation
It Quotation
rained Quotation
dreadfully Quotation
hard Quotation
for Quotation
half Quotation
an Quotation
hour Quotation
while Quotation
we Quotation
were Quotation
at Quotation
breakfast. Quotation
 Quotation
I Quotation
wanted Quotation
them Quotation
to Quotation
put Quotation
off Quotation
the Quotation
wedding." Quotation
"By Quotation
the Quotation
bye--I Quotation
have Quotation
not Quotation
wished Quotation
you Quotation
joy. Quotation
 Quotation
Being Quotation
pretty Quotation
well Quotation
aware Quotation
of Quotation
what Quotation
sort Quotation
of Quotation
joy Quotation
you Quotation
must Quotation
both Quotation
be Quotation
feeling, Quotation
I Quotation
have Quotation
been Quotation
in Quotation
no Quotation
hurry Quotation
with Quotation
my Quotation
congratulations; Quotation
but Quotation
I Quotation
hope Quotation
it Quotation
all Quotation
went Quotation
off Quotation
tolerably Quotation
well. Quotation
 Quotation
How Quotation
did Quotation
you Quotation
all Quotation
behave? Quotation
Who Quotation
cried Quotation
most?" Quotation
"Ah! Quotation
poor Quotation
Miss Quotation
Taylor! Quotation
'Tis Quotation
a Quotation
sad Quotation
business." Quotation
"Poor Quotation
Mr. Quotation
and Quotation
Miss Quotation
Woodhouse, Quotation
if Quotation
you Quotation
please; Quotation
but Quotation
I Quotation
cannot Quotation
possibly Quotation
say Quotation
'poor Quotation
Miss Quotation
Taylor.' Quotation
I Quotation
have Quotation
a Quotation
great Quotation
regard Quotation
for Quotation
you Quotation
and Quotation
Emma; Quotation
but Quotation
when Quotation
it Quotation
comes Quotation
to Quotation
the Quotation
question Quotation
of Quotation
dependence Quotation
or Quotation
independence!-- Quotation
At Quotation
any Quotation
rate, Quotation
it Quotation
must Quotation
be Quotation
better Quotation
to Quotation
have Quotation
only Quotation
one Quotation
to Quotation
please Quotation
than Quotation
two." Quotation
"Especially Quotation
when Quotation
one Quotation
of Quotation
those Quotation
two Quotation
is Quotation
such Quotation
a Quotation
fanciful, Quotation
troublesome Quotation
creature!" Quotation
said Cue
Emma Entity
playfully. O
 O
"That Quotation
is Quotation
what Quotation
you Quotation
have Quotation
in Quotation
your Quotation
head, Quotation
I Quotation
know-- Quotation
and Quotation
what Quotation
you Quotation
would Quotation
certainly Quotation
say Quotation
if Quotation
my Quotation
father Quotation
were Quotation
not Quotation
by." Quotation
"I Quotation
believe Quotation
it Quotation
is Quotation
very Quotation
true, Quotation
my Quotation
dear, Quotation
indeed," Quotation
said Cue
Mr. Entity
Woodhouse, Entity
with O
a O
sigh. O
 O
"I Quotation
am Quotation
afraid Quotation
I Quotation
am Quotation
sometimes Quotation
very Quotation
fanciful Quotation
and Quotation
troublesome." Quotation
"My Quotation
dearest Quotation
papa! Quotation
You Quotation
do Quotation
not Quotation
think Quotation
I Quotation
could Quotation
mean Quotation
you, Quotation
or Quotation
suppose Quotation
Mr. Quotation
Knightley Quotation
to Quotation
mean Quotation
you. Quotation
 Quotation
What Quotation
a Quotation
horrible Quotation
idea! Quotation
Oh Quotation
no! Quotation
I Quotation
meant Quotation
only Quotation
myself. Quotation
 Quotation
Mr. Quotation
Knightley Quotation
loves Quotation
to Quotation
find Quotation
fault Quotation
with Quotation
me, Quotation
you Quotation
know-- Quotation
in Quotation
a Quotation
joke-- Quotation
it Quotation
is Quotation
all Quotation
a Quotation
joke. Quotation
 Quotation
We Quotation
always Quotation
say Quotation
what Quotation
we Quotation
like Quotation
to Quotation
one Quotation
another." Quotation
Mr. O
Knightley, O
in O
fact, O
was O
one O
of O
the O
few O
people O
who O
could O
see O
faults O
in O
Emma O
Woodhouse, O
and O
the O
only O
one O
who O
ever O
told O
her O
of O
them: O
and O
though O
this O
was O
not O
particularly O
agreeable O
to O
Emma O
herself, O
she O
knew O
it O
would O
be O
so O
much O
less O
so O
to O
her O
father, O
that O
she O
would O
not O
have O
him O
really O
suspect O
such O
a O
circumstance O
as O
her O
not O
being O
thought O
perfect O
by O
every O
body. O
"Emma Quotation
knows Quotation
I Quotation
never Quotation
flatter Quotation
her," Quotation
said Cue
Mr. Entity
Knightley, Entity
"but Quotation
I Quotation
meant Quotation
no Quotation
reflection Quotation
on Quotation
any Quotation
body. Quotation
 Quotation
Miss Quotation
Taylor Quotation
has Quotation
been Quotation
used Quotation
to Quotation
have Quotation
two Quotation
persons Quotation
to Quotation
please; Quotation
she Quotation
will Quotation
now Quotation
have Quotation
but Quotation
one. Quotation
 Quotation
The Quotation
chances Quotation
are Quotation
that Quotation
she Quotation
must Quotation
be Quotation
a Quotation
gainer." Quotation
"Well," Quotation
said Cue
Emma, Entity
willing O
to O
let O
it O
pass-- O
"you Quotation
want Quotation
to Quotation
hear Quotation
about Quotation
the Quotation
wedding; Quotation
and Quotation
I Quotation
shall Quotation
be Quotation
happy Quotation
to Quotation
tell Quotation
you, Quotation
for Quotation
we Quotation
all Quotation
behaved Quotation
charmingly. Quotation
 Quotation
Every Quotation
body Quotation
was Quotation
punctual, Quotation
every Quotation
body Quotation
in Quotation
their Quotation
best Quotation
looks: Quotation
not Quotation
a Quotation
tear, Quotation
and Quotation
hardly Quotation
a Quotation
long Quotation
face Quotation
to Quotation
be Quotation
seen. Quotation
 Quotation
Oh Quotation
no; Quotation
we Quotation
all Quotation
felt Quotation
that Quotation
we Quotation
were Quotation
going Quotation
to Quotation
be Quotation
only Quotation
half Quotation
a Quotation
mile Quotation
apart, Quotation
and Quotation
were Quotation
sure Quotation
of Quotation
meeting Quotation
every Quotation
day." Quotation
"Dear Quotation
Emma Quotation
bears Quotation
every Quotation
thing Quotation
so Quotation
well," Quotation
said Cue
her Entity
father. Entity
 O
"But, Quotation
Mr. Quotation
Knightley, Quotation
she Quotation
is Quotation
really Quotation
very Quotation
sorry Quotation
to Quotation
lose Quotation
poor Quotation
Miss Quotation
Taylor, Quotation
and Quotation
I Quotation
am Quotation
sure Quotation
she Quotation
will Quotation
miss Quotation
her Quotation
more Quotation
than Quotation
she Quotation
thinks Quotation
for." Quotation
Emma O
turned O
away O
her O
head, O
divided O
between O
tears O
and O
smiles. O
 O
"It Quotation
is Quotation
impossible Quotation
that Quotation
Emma Quotation
should Quotation
not Quotation
miss Quotation
such Quotation
a Quotation
companion," Quotation
said Cue
Mr. Entity
Knightley. Entity
 O
"We Quotation
should Quotation
not Quotation
like Quotation
her Quotation
so Quotation
well Quotation
as Quotation
we Quotation
do, Quotation
sir, Quotation
if Quotation
we Quotation
could Quotation
suppose Quotation
it; Quotation
but Quotation
she Quotation
knows Quotation
how Quotation
much Quotation
the Quotation
marriage Quotation
is Quotation
to Quotation
Miss Quotation
Taylor's Quotation
advantage; Quotation
she Quotation
knows Quotation
how Quotation
very Quotation
acceptable Quotation
it Quotation
must Quotation
be, Quotation
at Quotation
Miss Quotation
Taylor's Quotation
time Quotation
of Quotation
life, Quotation
to Quotation
be Quotation
settled Quotation
in Quotation
a Quotation
home Quotation
of Quotation
her Quotation
own, Quotation
and Quotation
how Quotation
important Quotation
to Quotation
her Quotation
to Quotation
be Quotation
secure Quotation
of Quotation
a Quotation
comfortable Quotation
provision, Quotation
and Quotation
therefore Quotation
cannot Quotation
allow Quotation
herself Quotation
to Quotation
feel Quotation
so Quotation
much Quotation
pain Quotation
as Quotation
pleasure. Quotation
 Quotation
Every Quotation
friend Quotation
of Quotation
Miss Quotation
Taylor Quotation
must Quotation
be Quotation
glad Quotation
to Quotation
have Quotation
her Quotation
so Quotation
happily Quotation
married." Quotation
"And Quotation
you Quotation
have Quotation
forgotten Quotation
one Quotation
matter Quotation
of Quotation
joy Quotation
to Quotation
me," Quotation
said Cue
Emma, Entity
"and Quotation
a Quotation
very Quotation
considerable Quotation
one-- Quotation
that Quotation
I Quotation
made Quotation
the Quotation
match Quotation
myself. Quotation
 Quotation
I Quotation
made Quotation
the Quotation
match, Quotation
you Quotation
know, Quotation
four Quotation
years Quotation
ago; Quotation
and Quotation
to Quotation
have Quotation
it Quotation
take Quotation
place, Quotation
and Quotation
be Quotation
proved Quotation
in Quotation
the Quotation
right, Quotation
when Quotation
so Quotation
many Quotation
people Quotation
said Quotation
Mr. Quotation
Weston Quotation
would Quotation
never Quotation
marry Quotation
again, Quotation
may Quotation
comfort Quotation
me Quotation
for Quotation
any Quotation
thing." Quotation
Mr. O
Knightley O
shook O
his O
head O
at O
her. O
 O
Her Entity
father Entity
fondly O
replied, O
"Ah! O
my O
dear, O
I O
wish O
you O
would O
not O
make O
matches O
and O
foretell O
things, O
for O
whatever O
you O
say O
always O
comes O
to O
pass. O
 O
Pray O
do O
not O
make O
any O
more O
matches." O
"I O
promise O
you O
to O
make O
none O
for O
myself, O
papa; O
but O
I O
must, O
indeed, O
for O
other O
people. O
 O
It O
is O
the O
greatest O
amusement O
in O
the O
world! O
And O
after O
such O
success, O
you O
know!-- O
Every O
body O
said O
that O
Mr. O
Weston O
would O
never O
marry O
again. O
 O
Oh O
dear, O
no! O
Mr. O
Weston, O
who O
had O
been O
a O
widower O
so O
long, O
and O
who O
seemed O
so O
perfectly O
comfortable O
without O
a O
wife, O
so O
constantly O
occupied O
either O
in O
his O
business O
in O
town O
or O
among O
his O
friends O
here, O
always O
acceptable O
wherever O
he O
went, O
always O
cheerful-- O
Mr. O
Weston O
need O
not O
spend O
a O
single O
evening O
in O
the O
year O
alone O
if O
he O
did O
not O
like O
it. O
 O
Oh O
no! O
Mr. O
Weston O
certainly O
would O
never O
marry O
again. O
 O
Some O
people O
even O
talked O
of O
a O
promise O
to O
his O
wife O
on O
her O
deathbed, O
and O
others O
of O
the O
son O
and O
the O
uncle O
not O
letting O
him. O
 O
All O
manner O
of O
solemn O
nonsense O
was O
talked O
on O
the O
subject, O
but O
I O
believed O
none O
of O
it. O
 O
Ever O
since O
the O
day-- O
about O
four O
years O
ago-- O
that O
Miss O
Taylor O
and O
I O
met O
with O
him O
in O
Broadway O
Lane, O
when, O
because O
it O
began O
to O
drizzle, O
he O
darted O
away O
with O
so O
much O
gallantry, O
and O
borrowed O
two O
umbrellas O
for O
us O
from O
Farmer O
Mitchell's, O
I O
made O
up O
my O
mind O
on O
the O
subject. O
 O
I O
planned O
the O
match O
from O
that O
hour; O
and O
when O
such O
success O
has O
blessed O
me O
in O
this O
instance, O
dear O
papa, O
you O
cannot O
think O
that O
I O
shall O
leave O
off O
match-making." O
"I O
do O
not O
understand O
what O
you O
mean O
by O
'success,'" O
said O
Mr. O
Knightley. O
"Success O
supposes O
endeavour. O
 O
Your O
time O
has O
been O
properly O
and O
delicately O
spent, O
if O
you O
have O
been O
endeavouring O
for O
the O
last O
four O
years O
to O
bring O
about O
this O
marriage. O
 O
A O
worthy O
employment O
for O
a O
young O
lady's O
mind! O
But O
if, O
which O
I O
rather O
imagine, O
your O
making O
the O
match, O
as O
you O
call O
it, O
means O
only O
your O
planning O
it, O
your O
saying O
to O
yourself O
one O
idle O
day, O
'I O
think O
it O
would O
be O
a O
very O
good O
thing O
for O
Miss O
Taylor O
if O
Mr. O
Weston O
were O
to O
marry O
her,' O
and O
saying O
it O
again O
to O
yourself O
every O
now O
and O
then O
afterwards, O
why O
do O
you O
talk O
of O
success? O
Where O
is O
your O
merit? O
What O
are O
you O
proud O
of? O
You O
made O
a O
lucky O
guess; O
and O
that O
is O
all O
that O
can O
be O
said." O
"And O
have O
you O
never O
known O
the O
pleasure O
and O
triumph O
of O
a O
lucky O
guess?-- O
I O
pity O
you.--I O
thought O
you O
cleverer-- O
for, O
depend O
upon O
it O
a O
lucky O
guess O
is O
never O
merely O
luck. O
 O
There O
is O
always O
some O
talent O
in O
it. O
 O
And O
as O
to O
my O
poor O
word O
'success,' O
which O
you O
quarrel O
with, O
I O
do O
not O
know O
that O
I O
am O
so O
entirely O
without O
any O
claim O
to O
it. O
 O
You O
have O
drawn O
two O
pretty O
pictures; O
but O
I O
think O
there O
may O
be O
a O
third--a O
something O
between O
the O
do-nothing O
and O
the O
do-all. O
If O
I O
had O
not O
promoted O
Mr. O
Weston's O
visits O
here, O
and O
given O
many O
little O
encouragements, O
and O
smoothed O
many O
little O
matters, O
it O
might O
not O
have O
come O
to O
any O
thing O
after O
all. O
 O
I O
think O
you O
must O
know O
Hartfield O
enough O
to O
comprehend O
that." O
"A O
straightforward, O
open-hearted O
man O
like O
Weston, O
and O
a O
rational, O
unaffected O
woman O
like O
Miss O
Taylor, O
may O
be O
safely O
left O
to O
manage O
their O
own O
concerns. O
 O
You O
are O
more O
likely O
to O
have O
done O
harm O
to O
yourself, O
than O
good O
to O
them, O
by O
interference." O
"Emma O
never O
thinks O
of O
herself, O
if O
she O
can O
do O
good O
to O
others," O
rejoined O
Mr. O
Woodhouse, O
understanding O
but O
in O
part. O
 O
"But, O
my O
dear, O
pray O
do O
not O
make O
any O
more O
matches; O
they O
are O
silly O
things, O
and O
break O
up O
one's O
family O
circle O
grievously." O
"Only O
one O
more, O
papa; O
only O
for O
Mr. O
Elton. O
 O
Poor O
Mr. O
Elton! O
You O
like O
Mr. O
Elton, O
papa,--I O
must O
look O
about O
for O
a O
wife O
for O
him. O
 O
There O
is O
nobody O
in O
Highbury O
who O
deserves O
him-- O
and O
he O
has O
been O
here O
a O
whole O
year, O
and O
has O
fitted O
up O
his O
house O
so O
comfortably, O
that O
it O
would O
be O
a O
shame O
to O
have O
him O
single O
any O
longer-- O
and O
I O
thought O
when O
he O
was O
joining O
their O
hands O
to-day, O
he O
looked O
so O
very O
much O
as O
if O
he O
would O
like O
to O
have O
the O
same O
kind O
office O
done O
for O
him! O
I O
think O
very O
well O
of O
Mr. O
Elton, O
and O
this O
is O
the O
only O
way O
I O
have O
of O
doing O
him O
a O
service." O
"Mr. O
Elton O
is O
a O
very O
pretty O
young O
man, O
to O
be O
sure, O
and O
a O
very O
good O
young O
man, O
and O
I O
have O
a O
great O
regard O
for O
him. O
 O
But O
if O
you O
want O
to O
shew O
him O
any O
attention, O
my O
dear, O
ask O
him O
to O
come O
and O
dine O
with O
us O
some O
day. O
That O
will O
be O
a O
much O
better O
thing. O
 O
I O
dare O
say O
Mr. O
Knightley O
will O
be O
so O
kind O
as O
to O
meet O
him." O
"With O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
pleasure, O
sir, O
at O
any O
time," O
said O
Mr. O
Knightley, O
laughing, O
"and O
I O
agree O
with O
you O
entirely, O
that O
it O
will O
be O
a O
much O
better O
thing. O
 O
Invite O
him O
to O
dinner, O
Emma, O
and O
help O
him O
to O
the O
best O
of O
the O
fish O
and O
the O
chicken, O
but O
leave O
him O
to O
chuse O
his O
own O
wife. O
 O
Depend O
upon O
it, O
a O
man O
of O
six O
or O
seven-and-twenty O
can O
take O
care O
of O
himself." O

CHAPTER O
II O
Mr. O
Weston O
was O
a O
native O
of O
Highbury, O
and O
born O
of O
a O
respectable O
family, O
which O
for O
the O
last O
two O
or O
three O
generations O
had O
been O
rising O
into O
gentility O
and O
property. O
 O
He O
had O
received O
a O
good O
education, O
but, O
on O
succeeding O
early O
in O
life O
to O
a O
small O
independence, O
had O
become O
indisposed O
for O
any O
of O
the O
more O
homely O
pursuits O
in O
which O
his O
brothers O
were O
engaged, O
and O
had O
satisfied O
an O
active, O
cheerful O
mind O
and O
social O
temper O
by O
entering O
into O
the O
militia O
of O
his O
county, O
then O
embodied. O
Captain O
Weston O
was O
a O
general O
favourite; O
and O
when O
the O
chances O
of O
his O
military O
life O
had O
introduced O
him O
to O
Miss O
Churchill, O
of O
a O
great O
Yorkshire O
family, O
and O
Miss O
Churchill O
fell O
in O
love O
with O
him, O
nobody O
was O
surprized, O
except O
her O
brother O
and O
his O
wife, O
who O
had O
never O
seen O
him, O
and O
who O
were O
full O
of O
pride O
and O
importance, O
which O
the O
connexion O
would O
offend. O
Miss O
Churchill, O
however, O
being O
of O
age, O
and O
with O
the O
full O
command O
of O
her O
fortune-- O
though O
her O
fortune O
bore O
no O
proportion O
to O
the O
family-estate-- O
was O
not O
to O
be O
dissuaded O
from O
the O
marriage, O
and O
it O
took O
place, O
to O
the O
infinite O
mortification O
of O
Mr. O
and O
Mrs. O
Churchill, O
who O
threw O
her O
off O
with O
due O
decorum. O
 O
It O
was O
an O
unsuitable O
connexion, O
and O
did O
not O
produce O
much O
happiness. O
 O
Mrs. O
Weston O
ought O
to O
have O
found O
more O
in O
it, O
for O
she O
had O
a O
husband O
whose O
warm O
heart O
and O
sweet O
temper O
made O
him O
think O
every O
thing O
due O
to O
her O
in O
return O
for O
the O
great O
goodness O
of O
being O
in O
love O
with O
him; O
but O
though O
she O
had O
one O
sort O
of O
spirit, O
she O
had O
not O
the O
best. O
 O
She O
had O
resolution O
enough O
to O
pursue O
her O
own O
will O
in O
spite O
of O
her O
brother, O
but O
not O
enough O
to O
refrain O
from O
unreasonable O
regrets O
at O
that O
brother's O
unreasonable O
anger, O
nor O
from O
missing O
the O
luxuries O
of O
her O
former O
home. O
 O
They O
lived O
beyond O
their O
income, O
but O
still O
it O
was O
nothing O
in O
comparison O
of O
Enscombe: O
she O
did O
not O
cease O
to O
love O
her O
husband, O
but O
she O
wanted O
at O
once O
to O
be O
the O
wife O
of O
Captain O
Weston, O
and O
Miss O
Churchill O
of O
Enscombe. O
Captain O
Weston, O
who O
had O
been O
considered, O
especially O
by O
the O
Churchills, O
as O
making O
such O
an O
amazing O
match, O
was O
proved O
to O
have O
much O
the O
worst O
of O
the O
bargain; O
for O
when O
his O
wife O
died, O
after O
a O
three O
years' O
marriage, O
he O
was O
rather O
a O
poorer O
man O
than O
at O
first, O
and O
with O
a O
child O
to O
maintain. O
From O
the O
expense O
of O
the O
child, O
however, O
he O
was O
soon O
relieved. O
 O
The O
boy O
had, O
with O
the O
additional O
softening O
claim O
of O
a O
lingering O
illness O
of O
his O
mother's, O
been O
the O
means O
of O
a O
sort O
of O
reconciliation; O
and O
Mr. O
and O
Mrs. O
Churchill, O
having O
no O
children O
of O
their O
own, O
nor O
any O
other O
young O
creature O
of O
equal O
kindred O
to O
care O
for, O
offered O
to O
take O
the O
whole O
charge O
of O
the O
little O
Frank O
soon O
after O
her O
decease. O
 O
Some O
scruples O
and O
some O
reluctance O
the O
widower-father O
may O
be O
supposed O
to O
have O
felt; O
but O
as O
they O
were O
overcome O
by O
other O
considerations, O
the O
child O
was O
given O
up O
to O
the O
care O
and O
the O
wealth O
of O
the O
Churchills, O
and O
he O
had O
only O
his O
own O
comfort O
to O
seek, O
and O
his O
own O
situation O
to O
improve O
as O
he O
could. O
A O
complete O
change O
of O
life O
became O
desirable. O
 O
He O
quitted O
the O
militia O
and O
engaged O
in O
trade, O
having O
brothers O
already O
established O
in O
a O
good O
way O
in O
London, O
which O
afforded O
him O
a O
favourable O
opening. O
 O
It O
was O
a O
concern O
which O
brought O
just O
employment O
enough. O
 O
He O
had O
still O
a O
small O
house O
in O
Highbury, O
where O
most O
of O
his O
leisure O
days O
were O
spent; O
and O
between O
useful O
occupation O
and O
the O
pleasures O
of O
society, O
the O
next O
eighteen O
or O
twenty O
years O
of O
his O
life O
passed O
cheerfully O
away. O
 O
He O
had, O
by O
that O
time, O
realised O
an O
easy O
competence-- O
enough O
to O
secure O
the O
purchase O
of O
a O
little O
estate O
adjoining O
Highbury, O
which O
he O
had O
always O
longed O
for-- O
enough O
to O
marry O
a O
woman O
as O
portionless O
even O
as O
Miss O
Taylor, O
and O
to O
live O
according O
to O
the O
wishes O
of O
his O
own O
friendly O
and O
social O
disposition. O
It O
was O
now O
some O
time O
since O
Miss O
Taylor O
had O
begun O
to O
influence O
his O
schemes; O
but O
as O
it O
was O
not O
the O
tyrannic O
influence O
of O
youth O
on O
youth, O
it O
had O
not O
shaken O
his O
determination O
of O
never O
settling O
till O
he O
could O
purchase O
Randalls, O
and O
the O
sale O
of O
Randalls O
was O
long O
looked O
forward O
to; O
but O
he O
had O
gone O
steadily O
on, O
with O
these O
objects O
in O
view, O
till O
they O
were O
accomplished. O
 O
He O
had O
made O
his O
fortune, O
bought O
his O
house, O
and O
obtained O
his O
wife; O
and O
was O
beginning O
a O
new O
period O
of O
existence, O
with O
every O
probability O
of O
greater O
happiness O
than O
in O
any O
yet O
passed O
through. O
 O
He O
had O
never O
been O
an O
unhappy O
man; O
his O
own O
temper O
had O
secured O
him O
from O
that, O
even O
in O
his O
first O
marriage; O
but O
his O
second O
must O
shew O
him O
how O
delightful O
a O
well-judging O
and O
truly O
amiable O
woman O
could O
be, O
and O
must O
give O
him O
the O
pleasantest O
proof O
of O
its O
being O
a O
great O
deal O
better O
to O
choose O
than O
to O
be O
chosen, O
to O
excite O
gratitude O
than O
to O
feel O
it. O
He O
had O
only O
himself O
to O
please O
in O
his O
choice: O
his O
fortune O
was O
his O
own; O
for O
as O
to O
Frank, O
it O
was O
more O
than O
being O
tacitly O
brought O
up O
as O
his O
uncle's O
heir, O
it O
had O
become O
so O
avowed O
an O
adoption O
as O
to O
have O
him O
assume O
the O
name O
of O
Churchill O
on O
coming O
of O
age. O
 O
It O
was O
most O
unlikely, O
therefore, O
that O
he O
should O
ever O
want O
his O
father's O
assistance. O
 O
His O
father O
had O
no O
apprehension O
of O
it. O
 O
The O
aunt O
was O
a O
capricious O
woman, O
and O
governed O
her O
husband O
entirely; O
but O
it O
was O
not O
in O
Mr. O
Weston's O
nature O
to O
imagine O
that O
any O
caprice O
could O
be O
strong O
enough O
to O
affect O
one O
so O
dear, O
and, O
as O
he O
believed, O
so O
deservedly O
dear. O
 O
He O
saw O
his O
son O
every O
year O
in O
London, O
and O
was O
proud O
of O
him; O
and O
his O
fond O
report O
of O
him O
as O
a O
very O
fine O
young O
man O
had O
made O
Highbury O
feel O
a O
sort O
of O
pride O
in O
him O
too. O
 O
He O
was O
looked O
on O
as O
sufficiently O
belonging O
to O
the O
place O
to O
make O
his O
merits O
and O
prospects O
a O
kind O
of O
common O
concern. O
Mr. O
Frank O
Churchill O
was O
one O
of O
the O
boasts O
of O
Highbury, O
and O
a O
lively O
curiosity O
to O
see O
him O
prevailed, O
though O
the O
compliment O
was O
so O
little O
returned O
that O
he O
had O
never O
been O
there O
in O
his O
life. O
 O
His O
coming O
to O
visit O
his O
father O
had O
been O
often O
talked O
of O
but O
never O
achieved. O
Now, O
upon O
his O
father's O
marriage, O
it O
was O
very O
generally O
proposed, O
as O
a O
most O
proper O
attention, O
that O
the O
visit O
should O
take O
place. O
 O
There O
was O
not O
a O
dissentient O
voice O
on O
the O
subject, O
either O
when O
Mrs. O
Perry O
drank O
tea O
with O
Mrs. O
and O
Miss O
Bates, O
or O
when O
Mrs. O
and O
Miss O
Bates O
returned O
the O
visit. O
 O
Now O
was O
the O
time O
for O
Mr. O
Frank O
Churchill O
to O
come O
among O
them; O
and O
the O
hope O
strengthened O
when O
it O
was O
understood O
that O
he O
had O
written O
to O
his O
new O
mother O
on O
the O
occasion. O
 O
For O
a O
few O
days, O
every O
morning O
visit O
in O
Highbury O
included O
some O
mention Cue
of O
the O
handsome O
letter O
Mrs. O
Weston O
had O
received. O
 O
"I Quotation
suppose Quotation
you Quotation
have Quotation
heard Quotation
of Quotation
the Quotation
handsome Quotation
letter Quotation
Mr. Quotation
Frank Quotation
Churchill Quotation
has Quotation
written Quotation
to Quotation
Mrs. Quotation
Weston? Quotation
I Quotation
understand Quotation
it Quotation
was Quotation
a Quotation
very Quotation
handsome Quotation
letter, Quotation
indeed. Quotation
 Quotation
Mr. Quotation
Woodhouse Quotation
told Quotation
me Quotation
of Quotation
it. Quotation
 Quotation
Mr. Quotation
Woodhouse Quotation
saw Quotation
the Quotation
letter, Quotation
and Quotation
he Quotation
says Quotation
he Quotation
never Quotation
saw Quotation
such Quotation
a Quotation
handsome Quotation
letter Quotation
in Quotation
his Quotation
life." Quotation
It O
was, O
indeed, O
a O
highly O
prized O
letter. O
 O
Mrs. O
Weston O
had, O
of O
course, O
formed O
a O
very O
favourable O
idea O
of O
the O
young O
man; O
and O
such O
a O
pleasing O
attention O
was O
an O
irresistible O
proof O
of O
his O
great O
good O
sense, O
and O
a O
most O
welcome O
addition O
to O
every O
source O
and O
every O
expression O
of O
congratulation O
which O
her O
marriage O
had O
already O
secured. O
 O
She O
felt O
herself O
a O
most O
fortunate O
woman; O
and O
she O
had O
lived O
long O
enough O
to O
know O
how O
fortunate O
she O
might O
well O
be O
thought, O
where O
the O
only O
regret O
was O
for O
a O
partial O
separation O
from O
friends O
whose O
friendship O
for O
her O
had O
never O
cooled, O
and O
who O
could O
ill O
bear O
to O
part O
with O
her. O
She O
knew O
that O
at O
times O
she O
must O
be O
missed; O
and O
could O
not O
think, O
without O
pain, O
of O
Emma's O
losing O
a O
single O
pleasure, O
or O
suffering O
an O
hour's O
ennui, O
from O
the O
want O
of O
her O
companionableness: O
but O
dear O
Emma O
was O
of O
no O
feeble O
character; O
she O
was O
more O
equal O
to O
her O
situation O
than O
most O
girls O
would O
have O
been, O
and O
had O
sense, O
and O
energy, O
and O
spirits O
that O
might O
be O
hoped O
would O
bear O
her O
well O
and O
happily O
through O
its O
little O
difficulties O
and O
privations. O
 O
And O
then O
there O
was O
such O
comfort O
in O
the O
very O
easy O
distance O
of O
Randalls O
from O
Hartfield, O
so O
convenient O
for O
even O
solitary O
female O
walking, O
and O
in O
Mr. O
Weston's O
disposition O
and O
circumstances, O
which O
would O
make O
the O
approaching O
season O
no O
hindrance O
to O
their O
spending O
half O
the O
evenings O
in O
the O
week O
together. O
Her O
situation O
was O
altogether O
the O
subject O
of O
hours O
of O
gratitude O
to O
Mrs. O
Weston, O
and O
of O
moments O
only O
of O
regret; O
and O
her O
satisfaction-- O
her O
more O
than O
satisfaction-- O
her O
cheerful O
enjoyment, O
was O
so O
just O
and O
so O
apparent, O
that O
Emma, O
well O
as O
she O
knew O
her O
father, O
was O
sometimes O
taken O
by O
surprize O
at O
his O
being O
still O
able O
to O
pity O
'poor O
Miss O
Taylor,' O
when O
they O
left O
her O
at O
Randalls O
in O
the O
centre O
of O
every O
domestic O
comfort, O
or O
saw O
her O
go O
away O
in O
the O
evening O
attended O
by O
her O
pleasant O
husband O
to O
a O
carriage O
of O
her O
own. O
 O
But O
never O
did O
she Entity
go O
without O
Mr. Entity
Woodhouse's Entity
giving O
a O
gentle O
sigh, O
and O
saying, Cue
"Ah, Quotation
poor Quotation
Miss Quotation
Taylor! Quotation
She Quotation
would Quotation
be Quotation
very Quotation
glad Quotation
to Quotation
stay." Quotation
There O
was O
no O
recovering O
Miss O
Taylor-- O
nor O
much O
likelihood O
of O
ceasing O
to O
pity O
her; O
but O
a O
few O
weeks O
brought O
some O
alleviation O
to O
Mr. O
Woodhouse. O
The O
compliments O
of O
his O
neighbours O
were O
over; O
he O
was O
no O
longer O
teased O
by O
being O
wished O
joy O
of O
so O
sorrowful O
an O
event; O
and O
the O
wedding-cake, O
which O
had O
been O
a O
great O
distress O
to O
him, O
was O
all O
eat O
up. O
 O
His O
own O
stomach O
could O
bear O
nothing O
rich, O
and O
he O
could O
never O
believe O
other O
people O
to O
be O
different O
from O
himself. O
 O
What O
was O
unwholesome O
to O
him O
he O
regarded O
as O
unfit O
for O
any O
body; O
and O
he O
had, O
therefore, O
earnestly O
tried O
to O
dissuade O
them O
from O
having O
any O
wedding-cake O
at O
all, O
and O
when O
that O
proved O
vain, O
as O
earnestly O
tried O
to O
prevent O
any O
body's O
eating O
it. O
 O
He O
had O
been O
at O
the O
pains O
of O
consulting O
Mr. O
Perry, O
the O
apothecary, O
on O
the O
subject. O
 O
Mr. O
Perry O
was O
an O
intelligent, O
gentlemanlike O
man, O
whose O
frequent O
visits O
were O
one O
of O
the O
comforts O
of O
Mr. O
Woodhouse's O
life; O
and O
upon O
being O
applied O
to, O
he O
could O
not O
but O
acknowledge O
(though O
it O
seemed O
rather O
against O
the O
bias O
of O
inclination) O
that O
wedding-cake O
might O
certainly O
disagree O
with O
many-- O
perhaps O
with O
most O
people, O
unless O
taken O
moderately. O
 O
With O
such O
an O
opinion, O
in O
confirmation O
of O
his O
own, O
Mr. O
Woodhouse O
hoped O
to O
influence O
every O
visitor O
of O
the O
newly O
married O
pair; O
but O
still O
the O
cake O
was O
eaten; O
and O
there O
was O
no O
rest O
for O
his O
benevolent O
nerves O
till O
it O
was O
all O
gone. O
There O
was O
a O
strange O
rumour O
in O
Highbury O
of O
all O
the O
little O
Perrys O
being O
seen O
with O
a O
slice O
of O
Mrs. O
Weston's O
wedding-cake O
in O
their O
hands: O
but O
Mr. O
Woodhouse O
would O
never O
believe O
it. O
CHAPTER O
III O
Mr. O
Woodhouse O
was O
fond O
of O
society O
in O
his O
own O
way. O
 O
He O
liked O
very O
much O
to O
have O
his O
friends O
come O
and O
see O
him; O
and O
from O
various O
united O
causes, O
from O
his O
long O
residence O
at O
Hartfield, O
and O
his O
good O
nature, O
from O
his O
fortune, O
his O
house, O
and O
his O
daughter, O
he O
could O
command O
the O
visits O
of O
his O
own O
little O
circle, O
in O
a O
great O
measure, O
as O
he O
liked. O
 O
He O
had O
not O
much O
intercourse O
with O
any O
families O
beyond O
that O
circle; O
his O
horror O
of O
late O
hours, O
and O
large O
dinner-parties, O
made O
him O
unfit O
for O
any O
acquaintance O
but O
such O
as O
would O
visit O
him O
on O
his O
own O
terms. O
 O
Fortunately O
for O
him, O
Highbury, O
including O
Randalls O
in O
the O
same O
parish, O
and O
Donwell O
Abbey O
in O
the O
parish O
adjoining, O
the O
seat O
of O
Mr. O
Knightley, O
comprehended O
many O
such. O
 O
Not O
unfrequently, O
through O
Emma's O
persuasion, O
he O
had O
some O
of O
the O
chosen O
and O
the O
best O
to O
dine O
with O
him: O
but O
evening O
parties O
were O
what O
he O
preferred; O
and, O
unless O
he O
fancied O
himself O
at O
any O
time O
unequal O
to O
company, O
there O
was O
scarcely O
an O
evening O
in O
the O
week O
in O
which O
Emma O
could O
not O
make O
up O
a O
card-table O
for O
him. O
Real, O
long-standing O
regard O
brought O
the O
Westons O
and O
Mr. O
Knightley; O
and O
by O
Mr. O
Elton, O
a O
young O
man O
living O
alone O
without O
liking O
it, O
the O
privilege O
of O
exchanging O
any O
vacant O
evening O
of O
his O
own O
blank O
solitude O
for O
the O
elegancies O
and O
society O
of O
Mr. O
Woodhouse's O
drawing-room, O
and O
the O
smiles O
of O
his O
lovely O
daughter, O
was O
in O
no O
danger O
of O
being O
thrown O
away. O
After O
these O
came O
a O
second O
set; O
among O
the O
most O
come-at-able O
of O
whom O
were O
Mrs. O
and O
Miss O
Bates, O
and O
Mrs. O
Goddard, O
three O
ladies O
almost O
always O
at O
the O
service O
of O
an O
invitation O
from O
Hartfield, O
and O
who O
were O
fetched O
and O
carried O
home O
so O
often, O
that O
Mr. O
Woodhouse O
thought O
it O
no O
hardship O
for O
either O
James O
or O
the O
horses. O
 O
Had O
it O
taken O
place O
only O
once O
a O
year, O
it O
would O
have O
been O
a O
grievance. O
Mrs. O
Bates, O
the O
widow O
of O
a O
former O
vicar O
of O
Highbury, O
was O
a O
very O
old O
lady, O
almost O
past O
every O
thing O
but O
tea O
and O
quadrille. O
 O
She O
lived O
with O
her O
single O
daughter O
in O
a O
very O
small O
way, O
and O
was O
considered O
with O
all O
the O
regard O
and O
respect O
which O
a O
harmless O
old O
lady, O
under O
such O
untoward O
circumstances, O
can O
excite. O
 O
Her O
daughter O
enjoyed O
a O
most O
uncommon O
degree O
of O
popularity O
for O
a O
woman O
neither O
young, O
handsome, O
rich, O
nor O
married. O
Miss O
Bates O
stood O
in O
the O
very O
worst O
predicament O
in O
the O
world O
for O
having O
much O
of O
the O
public O
favour; O
and O
she O
had O
no O
intellectual O
superiority O
to O
make O
atonement O
to O
herself, O
or O
frighten O
those O
who O
might O
hate O
her O
into O
outward O
respect. O
 O
She O
had O
never O
boasted O
either O
beauty O
or O
cleverness. O
Her O
youth O
had O
passed O
without O
distinction, O
and O
her O
middle O
of O
life O
was O
devoted O
to O
the O
care O
of O
a O
failing O
mother, O
and O
the O
endeavour O
to O
make O
a O
small O
income O
go O
as O
far O
as O
possible. O
 O
And O
yet O
she O
was O
a O
happy O
woman, O
and O
a O
woman O
whom O
no O
one O
named O
without O
good-will. O
 O
It O
was O
her O
own O
universal O
good-will O
and O
contented O
temper O
which O
worked O
such O
wonders. O
 O
She O
loved O
every O
body, O
was O
interested O
in O
every O
body's O
happiness, O
quicksighted O
to O
every O
body's O
merits; O
thought O
herself O
a O
most O
fortunate O
creature, O
and O
surrounded O
with O
blessings O
in O
such O
an O
excellent O
mother, O
and O
so O
many O
good O
neighbours O
and O
friends, O
and O
a O
home O
that O
wanted O
for O
nothing. O
 O
The O
simplicity O
and O
cheerfulness O
of O
her O
nature, O
her O
contented O
and O
grateful O
spirit, O
were O
a O
recommendation O
to O
every O
body, O
and O
a O
mine O
of O
felicity O
to O
herself. O
 O
She O
was O
a O
great O
talker O
upon O
little O
matters, O
which O
exactly O
suited O
Mr. O
Woodhouse, O
full O
of O
trivial O
communications O
and O
harmless O
gossip. O
Mrs. O
Goddard O
was O
the O
mistress O
of O
a O
School-- O
not O
of O
a O
seminary, O
or O
an O
establishment, O
or O
any O
thing O
which O
professed, O
in O
long O
sentences O
of O
refined O
nonsense, O
to O
combine O
liberal O
acquirements O
with O
elegant O
morality, O
upon O
new O
principles O
and O
new O
systems-- O
and O
where O
young O
ladies O
for O
enormous O
pay O
might O
be O
screwed O
out O
of O
health O
and O
into O
vanity-- O
but O
a O
real, O
honest, O
old-fashioned O
Boarding-school, O
where O
a O
reasonable O
quantity O
of O
accomplishments O
were O
sold O
at O
a O
reasonable O
price, O
and O
where O
girls O
might O
be O
sent O
to O
be O
out O
of O
the O
way, O
and O
scramble O
themselves O
into O
a O
little O
education, O
without O
any O
danger O
of O
coming O
back O
prodigies. O
 O
Mrs. O
Goddard's O
school O
was O
in O
high O
repute-- O
and O
very O
deservedly; O
for O
Highbury O
was O
reckoned O
a O
particularly O
healthy O
spot: O
she O
had O
an O
ample O
house O
and O
garden, O
gave O
the O
children O
plenty O
of O
wholesome O
food, O
let O
them O
run O
about O
a O
great O
deal O
in O
the O
summer, O
and O
in O
winter O
dressed O
their O
chilblains O
with O
her O
own O
hands. O
 O
It O
was O
no O
wonder O
that O
a O
train O
of O
twenty O
young O
couple O
now O
walked O
after O
her O
to O
church. O
 O
She O
was O
a O
plain, O
motherly O
kind O
of O
woman, O
who O
had O
worked O
hard O
in O
her O
youth, O
and O
now O
thought O
herself O
entitled O
to O
the O
occasional O
holiday O
of O
a O
tea-visit; O
and O
having O
formerly O
owed O
much O
to O
Mr. O
Woodhouse's O
kindness, O
felt O
his O
particular O
claim O
on O
her O
to O
leave O
her O
neat O
parlour, O
hung O
round O
with O
fancy-work, O
whenever O
she O
could, O
and O
win O
or O
lose O
a O
few O
sixpences O
by O
his O
fireside. O
These O
were O
the O
ladies O
whom O
Emma O
found O
herself O
very O
frequently O
able O
to O
collect; O
and O
happy O
was O
she, O
for O
her O
father's O
sake, O
in O
the O
power; O
though, O
as O
far O
as O
she O
was O
herself O
concerned, O
it O
was O
no O
remedy O
for O
the O
absence O
of O
Mrs. O
Weston. O
 O
She O
was O
delighted O
to O
see O
her O
father O
look O
comfortable, O
and O
very O
much O
pleased O
with O
herself O
for O
contriving O
things O
so O
well; O
but O
the O
quiet O
prosings O
of O
three O
such O
women O
made O
her O
feel O
that O
every O
evening O
so O
spent O
was O
indeed O
one O
of O
the O
long O
evenings O
she O
had O
fearfully O
anticipated. O
As O
she O
sat O
one O
morning, O
looking O
forward O
to O
exactly O
such O
a O
close O
of O
the O
present O
day, O
a O
note O
was O
brought O
from O
Mrs. O
Goddard, O
requesting, O
in O
most O
respectful O
terms, O
to O
be O
allowed O
to O
bring O
Miss O
Smith O
with O
her; O
a O
most O
welcome O
request: O
for O
Miss O
Smith O
was O
a O
girl O
of O
seventeen, O
whom O
Emma O
knew O
very O
well O
by O
sight, O
and O
had O
long O
felt O
an O
interest O
in, O
on O
account O
of O
her O
beauty. O
 O
A O
very O
gracious O
invitation O
was O
returned, O
and O
the O
evening O
no O
longer O
dreaded O
by O
the O
fair O
mistress O
of O
the O
mansion. O
Harriet O
Smith O
was O
the O
natural O
daughter O
of O
somebody. O
 O
Somebody O
had O
placed O
her, O
several O
years O
back, O
at O
Mrs. O
Goddard's O
school, O
and O
somebody O
had O
lately O
raised O
her O
from O
the O
condition O
of O
scholar O
to O
that O
of O
parlour-boarder. O
This O
was O
all O
that O
was O
generally O
known O
of O
her O
history. O
She O
had O
no O
visible O
friends O
but O
what O
had O
been O
acquired O
at O
Highbury, O
and O
was O
now O
just O
returned O
from O
a O
long O
visit O
in O
the O
country O
to O
some O
young O
ladies O
who O
had O
been O
at O
school O
there O
with O
her. O
She O
was O
a O
very O
pretty O
girl, O
and O
her O
beauty O
happened O
to O
be O
of O
a O
sort O
which O
Emma O
particularly O
admired. O
 O
She O
was O
short, O
plump, O
and O
fair, O
with O
a O
fine O
bloom, O
blue O
eyes, O
light O
hair, O
regular O
features, O
and O
a O
look O
of O
great O
sweetness, O
and, O
before O
the O
end O
of O
the O
evening, O
Emma O
was O
as O
much O
pleased O
with O
her O
manners O
as O
her O
person, O
and O
quite O
determined O
to O
continue O
the O
acquaintance. O
She O
was O
not O
struck O
by O
any O
thing O
remarkably O
clever O
in O
Miss O
Smith's O
conversation, O
but O
she O
found O
her O
altogether O
very O
engaging-- O
not O
inconveniently O
shy, O
not O
unwilling O
to O
talk-- O
and O
yet O
so O
far O
from O
pushing, O
shewing O
so O
proper O
and O
becoming O
a O
deference, O
seeming O
so O
pleasantly O
grateful O
for O
being O
admitted O
to O
Hartfield, O
and O
so O
artlessly O
impressed O
by O
the O
appearance O
of O
every O
thing O
in O
so O
superior O
a O
style O
to O
what O
she O
had O
been O
used O
to, O
that O
she O
must O
have O
good O
sense, O
and O
deserve O
encouragement. O
Encouragement O
should O
be O
given. O
 O
Those O
soft O
blue O
eyes, O
and O
all O
those O
natural O
graces, O
should O
not O
be O
wasted O
on O
the O
inferior O
society O
of O
Highbury O
and O
its O
connexions. O
 O
The O
acquaintance O
she O
had O
already O
formed O
were O
unworthy O
of O
her. O
 O
The O
friends O
from O
whom O
she O
had O
just O
parted, O
though O
very O
good O
sort O
of O
people, O
must O
be O
doing O
her O
harm. O
 O
They O
were O
a O
family O
of O
the O
name O
of O
Martin, O
whom O
Emma O
well O
knew O
by O
character, O
as O
renting O
a O
large O
farm O
of O
Mr. O
Knightley, O
and O
residing O
in O
the O
parish O
of O
Donwell-- O
very O
creditably, O
she O
believed-- O
she O
knew O
Mr. O
Knightley O
thought O
highly O
of O
them-- O
but O
they O
must O
be O
coarse O
and O
unpolished, O
and O
very O
unfit O
to O
be O
the O
intimates O
of O
a O
girl O
who O
wanted O
only O
a O
little O
more O
knowledge O
and O
elegance O
to O
be O
quite O
perfect. O
 O
She O
would O
notice O
her; O
she O
would O
improve O
her; O
she O
would O
detach O
her O
from O
her O
bad O
acquaintance, O
and O
introduce O
her O
into O
good O
society; O
she O
would O
form O
her O
opinions O
and O
her O
manners. O
 O
It O
would O
be O
an O
interesting, O
and O
certainly O
a O
very O
kind O
undertaking; O
highly O
becoming O
her O
own O
situation O
in O
life, O
her O
leisure, O
and O
powers. O
She O
was O
so O
busy O
in O
admiring O
those O
soft O
blue O
eyes, O
in O
talking O
and O
listening, O
and O
forming O
all O
these O
schemes O
in O
the O
in-betweens, O
that O
the O
evening O
flew O
away O
at O
a O
very O
unusual O
rate; O
and O
the O
supper-table, O
which O
always O
closed O
such O
parties, O
and O
for O
which O
she O
had O
been O
used O
to O
sit O
and O
watch O
the O
due O
time, O
was O
all O
set O
out O
and O
ready, O
and O
moved O
forwards O
to O
the O
fire, O
before O
she O
was O
aware. O
 O
With O
an O
alacrity O
beyond O
the O
common O
impulse O
of O
a O
spirit O
which O
yet O
was O
never O
indifferent O
to O
the O
credit O
of O
doing O
every O
thing O
well O
and O
attentively, O
with O
the O
real O
good-will O
of O
a O
mind O
delighted O
with O
its O
own O
ideas, O
did O
she O
then O
do O
all O
the O
honours O
of O
the O
meal, O
and O
help O
and O
recommend O
the O
minced O
chicken O
and O
scalloped O
oysters, O
with O
an O
urgency O
which O
she O
knew O
would O
be O
acceptable O
to O
the O
early O
hours O
and O
civil O
scruples O
of O
their O
guests. O
Upon O
such O
occasions O
poor O
Mr. O
Woodhouses O
feelings O
were O
in O
sad O
warfare. O
He O
loved O
to O
have O
the O
cloth O
laid, O
because O
it O
had O
been O
the O
fashion O
of O
his O
youth, O
but O
his O
conviction O
of O
suppers O
being O
very O
unwholesome O
made O
him O
rather O
sorry O
to O
see O
any O
thing O
put O
on O
it; O
and O
while O
his O
hospitality O
would O
have O
welcomed O
his O
visitors O
to O
every O
thing, O
his O
care O
for O
their O
health O
made O
him O
grieve O
that O
they O
would O
eat. O
Such O
another O
small O
basin O
of O
thin O
gruel O
as O
his O
own O
was O
all O
that O
he O
could, O
with O
thorough O
self-approbation, O
recommend; O
though O
he Entity
might O
constrain O
himself, O
while O
the Entity
ladies Entity
were O
comfortably O
clearing O
the O
nicer O
things, O
to O
say: Cue
"Mrs. Quotation
Bates, Quotation
let Quotation
me Quotation
propose Quotation
your Quotation
venturing Quotation
on Quotation
one Quotation
of Quotation
these Quotation
eggs. Quotation
 Quotation

 Quotation
I Quotation

Emma O
allowed O
her O
father O
to O
talk-- O
but O
supplied O
her O
visitors O
in O
a O
much O
more O
satisfactory O
style, O
and O
on O
the O
present O
evening O
had O
particular O
pleasure O
in O
sending O
them O
away O
happy. O
 O
The O
happiness O
of O
Miss O
Smith O
was O
quite O
equal O
to O
her O
intentions. O
 O
Miss O
Woodhouse O
was O
so O
great O
a O
personage O
in O
Highbury, O
that O
the O
prospect O
of O
the O
introduction O
had O
given O
as O
much O
panic O
as O
pleasure; O
but O
the O
humble, O
grateful O
little O
girl O
went O
off O
with O
highly O
gratified O
feelings, O
delighted O
with O
the O
affability O
with O
which O
Miss O
Woodhouse O
had O
treated O
her O
all O
the O
evening, O
and O
actually O
shaken O
hands O
with O
her O
at O
last! O
CHAPTER O
IV O
Harriet O
Smith's O
intimacy O
at O
Hartfield O
was O
soon O
a O
settled O
thing. O
 O
Quick O
and O
decided O
in O
her O
ways, O
Emma O
lost O
no O
time O
in O
inviting, O
encouraging, O
and O
telling O
her O
to O
come O
very O
often; O
and O
as O
their O
acquaintance O
increased, O
so O
did O
their O
satisfaction O
in O
each O
other. O
 O
As O
a O
walking O
companion, O
Emma O
had O
very O
early O
foreseen O
how O
useful O
she O
might O
find O
her. O
In O
that O
respect O
Mrs. O
Weston's O
loss O
had O
been O
important. O
 O
Her O
father O
never O
went O
beyond O
the O
shrubbery, O
where O
two O
divisions O
of O
the O
ground O
sufficed O
him O
for O
his O
long O
walk, O
or O
his O
short, O
as O
the O
year O
varied; O
and O
since O
Mrs. O
Weston's O
marriage O
her O
exercise O
had O
been O
too O
much O
confined. O
She O
had O
ventured O
once O
alone O
to O
Randalls, O
but O
it O
was O
not O
pleasant; O
and O
a O
Harriet O
Smith, O
therefore, O
one O
whom O
she O
could O
summon O
at O
any O
time O
to O
a O
walk, O
would O
be O
a O
valuable O
addition O
to O
her O
privileges. O
 O
But O
in O
every O
respect, O
as O
she O
saw O
more O
of O
her, O
she O
approved O
her, O
and O
was O
confirmed O
in O
all O
her O
kind O
designs. O
Harriet O
certainly O
was O
not O
clever, O
but O
she O
had O
a O
sweet, O
docile, O
grateful O
disposition, O
was O
totally O
free O
from O
conceit, O
and O
only O
desiring O
to O
be O
guided O
by O
any O
one O
she O
looked O
up O
to. O
 O
Her O
early O
attachment O
to O
herself O
was O
very O
amiable; O
and O
her O
inclination O
for O
good O
company, O
and O
power O
of O
appreciating O
what O
was O
elegant O
and O
clever, O
shewed O
that O
there O
was O
no O
want O
of O
taste, O
though O
strength O
of O
understanding O
must O
not O
be O
expected. O
Altogether O
she O
was O
quite O
convinced O
of O
Harriet O
Smith's O
being O
exactly O
the O
young O
friend O
she O
wanted-- O
exactly O
the O
something O
which O
her O
home O
required. O
Such O
a O
friend O
as O
Mrs. O
Weston O
was O
out O
of O
the O
question. O
 O
Two O
such O
could O
never O
be O
granted. O
 O
Two O
such O
she O
did O
not O
want. O
 O
It O
was O
quite O
a O
different O
sort O
of O
thing, O
a O
sentiment O
distinct O
and O
independent. O
 O
Mrs. O
Weston O
was O
the O
object O
of O
a O
regard O
which O
had O
its O
basis O
in O
gratitude O
and O
esteem. O
Harriet O
would O
be O
loved O
as O
one O
to O
whom O
she O
could O
be O
useful. O
 O
For O
Mrs. O
Weston O
there O
was O
nothing O
to O
be O
done; O
for O
Harriet O
every O
thing. O
Her O
first O
attempts O
at O
usefulness O
were O
in O
an O
endeavour O
to O
find O
out O
who O
were O
the O
parents, O
but O
Harriet O
could O
not O
tell. O
 O
She O
was O
ready O
to O
tell O
every O
thing O
in O
her O
power, O
but O
on O
this O
subject O
questions O
were O
vain. O
Emma O
was O
obliged O
to O
fancy O
what O
she O
liked-- O
but O
she O
could O
never O
believe O
that O
in O
the O
same O
situation O
she O
should O
not O
have O
discovered O
the O
truth. O
Harriet O
had O
no O
penetration. O
 O
She O
had O
been O
satisfied O
to O
hear O
and O
believe O
just O
what O
Mrs. O
Goddard O
chose O
to O
tell O
her; O
and O
looked O
no O
farther. O
Mrs. O
Goddard, O
and O
the O
teachers, O
and O
the O
girls O
and O
the O
affairs O
of O
the O
school O
in O
general, O
formed O
naturally O
a O
great O
part O
of O
the O
conversation-- O
and O
but O
for O
her O
acquaintance O
with O
the O
Martins O
of O
Abbey-Mill O
Farm, O
it O
must O
have O
been O
the O
whole. O
 O
But O
the O
Martins O
occupied O
her O
thoughts O
a O
good O
deal; O
she O
had O
spent O
two O
very O
happy O
months O
with O
them, O
and O
now O
loved O
to O
talk O
of O
the O
pleasures O
of O
her O
visit, O
and O
describe O
the O
many O
comforts O
and O
wonders O
of O
the O
place. O
 O
Emma Entity
encouraged O
her Entity
talkativeness-- O
amused O
by O
such O
a O
picture O
of O
another O
set O
of O
beings, O
and O
enjoying O
the O
youthful O
simplicity O
which O
could O
speak Cue
with O
so O
much O
exultation O
of O
Mrs. O
Martin's O
having O
"two Quotation
parlours, Quotation
two Quotation
very Quotation
good Quotation
parlours, Quotation
indeed; Quotation
one Quotation
of Quotation
them Quotation
quite Quotation
as Quotation
large Quotation
as Quotation
Mrs. Quotation
Goddard's Quotation
drawing-room; Quotation
and Quotation
of Quotation
her Quotation
having Quotation
an Quotation
upper Quotation
maid Quotation
who Quotation
had Quotation
lived Quotation
five-and-twenty Quotation
years Quotation
with Quotation
her; Quotation
and Quotation
of Quotation
their Quotation
having Quotation
eight Quotation
cows, Quotation
two Quotation
of Quotation
them Quotation
Alderneys, Quotation
and Quotation
one Quotation
a Quotation
little Quotation
Welch Quotation
cow, Quotation
a Quotation
very Quotation
pretty Quotation
little Quotation
Welch Quotation
cow Quotation
indeed; Quotation
and Quotation
of Quotation
Mrs. Quotation
Martin's Quotation
saying Quotation
as Quotation
she Quotation
was Quotation
so Quotation
fond Quotation
of Quotation
it, Quotation
it Quotation
should Quotation
be Quotation
called Quotation
her Quotation
cow; Quotation
and Quotation
of Quotation
their Quotation
having Quotation
a Quotation
very Quotation
handsome Quotation
summer-house Quotation
in Quotation
their Quotation
garden, Quotation
where Quotation
some Quotation
day Quotation
next Quotation
year Quotation
they Quotation
were Quotation
all Quotation
to Quotation
drink Quotation
tea: Quotation
-- Quotation
a Quotation
very Quotation
handsome Quotation
summer-house, Quotation
large Quotation
enough Quotation
to Quotation
hold Quotation
a Quotation
dozen Quotation
people." Quotation
For O
some O
time O
she O
was O
amused, O
without O
thinking O
beyond O
the O
immediate O
cause; O
but O
as O
she O
came O
to O
understand O
the O
family O
better, O
other O
feelings O
arose. O
 O
She O
had O
taken O
up O
a O
wrong O
idea, O
fancying O
it O
was O
a O
mother O
and O
daughter, O
a O
son O
and O
son's O
wife, O
who O
all O
lived O
together; O
but O
when O
it O
appeared O
that O
the O
Mr. O
Martin, O
who O
bore O
a O
part O
in O
the O
narrative, O
and O
was O
always O
mentioned O
with O
approbation O
for O
his O
great O
good-nature O
in O
doing O
something O
or O
other, O
was O
a O
single O
man; O
that O
there O
was O
no O
young O
Mrs. O
Martin, O
no O
wife O
in O
the O
case; O
she O
did O
suspect O
danger O
to O
her O
poor O
little O
friend O
from O
all O
this O
hospitality O
and O
kindness, O
and O
that, O
if O
she O
were O
not O
taken O
care O
of, O
she O
might O
be O
required O
to O
sink O
herself O
forever. O
With O
this O
inspiriting O
notion, O
her O
questions O
increased O
in O
number O
and O
meaning; O
and O
she Entity
particularly O
led O
Harriet O
to O
talk O
more O
of O
Mr. O
Martin, O
and O
there O
was O
evidently O
no O
dislike O
to O
it. O
 O
Harriet Entity
was O
very O
ready O
to O
speak Cue
of Quotation
the Quotation
share Quotation
he Quotation
had Quotation
had Quotation
in Quotation
their Quotation
moonlight Quotation
walks Quotation
and Quotation
merry Quotation
evening Quotation
games; Quotation
and Quotation
dwelt Quotation
a Quotation
good Quotation
deal Quotation
upon Quotation
his Quotation
being Quotation
so Quotation
very Quotation
good-humoured Quotation
and Quotation
obliging. Quotation
 O
He O
had O
gone O
three O
miles O
round O
one O
day O
in O
order O
to O
bring O
her O
some O
walnuts, O
because O
she O
had O
said O
how O
fond O
she O
was O
of O
them, O
and O
in O
every O
thing O
else O
he O
was O
so O
very O
obliging. O
 O
He O
had O
his O
shepherd's O
son O
into O
the O
parlour O
one O
night O
on O
purpose O
to O
sing O
to O
her. O
She O
was O
very O
fond O
of O
singing. O
 O
He O
could O
sing O
a O
little O
himself. O
 O
She O
believed O
he O
was O
very O
clever, O
and O
understood O
every O
thing. O
 O
He O
had O
a O
very O
fine O
flock, O
and, O
while O
she O
was O
with O
them, O
he O
had O
been O
bid O
more O
for O
his O
wool O
than O
any O
body O
in O
the O
country. O
 O
She O
believed O
every O
body O
spoke O
well O
of O
him. O
 O
His O
mother O
and O
sisters O
were O
very O
fond O
of O
him. O
 O
Mrs. Entity
Martin Entity
had O
told Cue
her Entity
one O
day O
(and O
there O
was O
a O
blush O
as O
she O
said O
it,) O
that Quotation
it Quotation
was Quotation
impossible Quotation
for Quotation
any Quotation
body Quotation
to Quotation
be Quotation
a Quotation
better Quotation
son, Quotation
and Quotation
therefore Quotation
she Quotation
was Quotation
sure, Quotation
whenever Quotation
he Quotation
married, Quotation
he Quotation
would Quotation
make Quotation
a Quotation
good Quotation
husband. Quotation
 O
Not O
that O
she O
wanted O
him O
to O
marry. O
 O
She Entity
was O
in O
no O
hurry O
at O
all. O
"Well O
done, O
Mrs. O
Martin!" O
thought O
Emma. Entity
 O
"You O
know O
what O
you O
are O
about." O
"And Quotation
when Quotation
she Quotation
had Quotation
come Quotation
away, Quotation
Mrs. Quotation
Martin Quotation
was Quotation
so Quotation
very Quotation
kind Quotation
as Quotation
to Quotation
send Quotation
Mrs. Quotation
Goddard Quotation
a Quotation
beautiful Quotation
goose-- Quotation
the Quotation
finest Quotation
goose Quotation
Mrs. Quotation
Goddard Quotation
had Quotation
ever Quotation
seen. Quotation
 Quotation
Mrs. Quotation
Goddard Quotation
had Quotation
dressed Quotation
it Quotation
on Quotation
a Quotation
Sunday, Quotation
and Quotation
asked Quotation
all Quotation
the Quotation
three Quotation
teachers, Quotation
Miss Quotation
Nash, Quotation
and Quotation
Miss Quotation
Prince, Quotation
and Quotation
Miss Quotation
Richardson, Quotation
to Quotation
sup Quotation
with Quotation
her." Quotation
"Mr. Quotation
Martin, Quotation
I Quotation
suppose, Quotation
is Quotation
not Quotation
a Quotation
man Quotation
of Quotation
information Quotation
beyond Quotation
the Quotation
line Quotation
of Quotation
his Quotation
own Quotation
business? Quotation
He Quotation
does Quotation
not Quotation
read?" Quotation
"Oh Quotation
yes!-- Quotation
that Quotation
is, Quotation
no Quotation
-- Quotation
I Quotation
do Quotation
not Quotation
know-- Quotation
but Quotation
I Quotation
believe Quotation
he Quotation
has Quotation
read Quotation
a Quotation
good Quotation
deal-- Quotation
but Quotation
not Quotation
what Quotation
you Quotation
would Quotation
think Quotation
any Quotation
thing Quotation
of. Quotation
 Quotation
He Quotation
reads Quotation
the Quotation
Agricultural Quotation
Reports, Quotation
and Quotation
some Quotation
other Quotation
books Quotation
that Quotation
lay Quotation
in Quotation
one Quotation
of Quotation
the Quotation
window Quotation
seats-- Quotation
but Quotation
he Quotation
reads Quotation
all Quotation
them Quotation
to Quotation
himself. Quotation
 Quotation
But Quotation
sometimes Quotation
of Quotation
an Quotation
evening, Quotation
before Quotation
we Quotation
went Quotation
to Quotation
cards, Quotation
he Quotation
would Quotation
read Quotation
something Quotation
aloud Quotation
out Quotation
of Quotation
the Quotation
Elegant Quotation
Extracts, Quotation
very Quotation
entertaining. Quotation
 Quotation
And Quotation
I Quotation
know Quotation
he Quotation
has Quotation
read Quotation
the Quotation
Vicar Quotation
of Quotation
Wakefield. Quotation
 Quotation
He Quotation
never Quotation
read Quotation
the Quotation
Romance Quotation
of Quotation
the Quotation
Forest, Quotation
nor Quotation
The Quotation
Children Quotation
of Quotation
the Quotation
Abbey. Quotation
 Quotation
He Quotation
had Quotation
never Quotation
heard Quotation
of Quotation
such Quotation
books Quotation
before Quotation
I Quotation
mentioned Quotation
them, Quotation
but Quotation
he Quotation
is Quotation
determined Quotation
to Quotation
get Quotation
them Quotation
now Quotation
as Quotation
soon Quotation
as Quotation
ever Quotation
he Quotation
can." Quotation
THE O
NEXT O
QUESTION O
WAS-- O
"What Quotation
sort Quotation
of Quotation
looking Quotation
man Quotation
is Quotation
Mr. Quotation
Martin?" Quotation
"Oh! Quotation
not Quotation
handsome-- Quotation
not Quotation
at Quotation
all Quotation
handsome. Quotation
 Quotation
I Quotation
thought Quotation
him Quotation
very Quotation
plain Quotation
at Quotation
first, Quotation
but Quotation
I Quotation
do Quotation
not Quotation
think Quotation
him Quotation
so Quotation
plain Quotation
now. Quotation
 Quotation
One Quotation
does Quotation
not, Quotation
you Quotation
know, Quotation
after Quotation
a Quotation
time. Quotation
 Quotation
But Quotation
did Quotation
you Quotation
never Quotation
see Quotation
him? Quotation
He Quotation
is Quotation
in Quotation
Highbury Quotation
every Quotation
now Quotation
and Quotation
then, Quotation
and Quotation
he Quotation
is Quotation
sure Quotation
to Quotation
ride Quotation
through Quotation
every Quotation
week Quotation
in Quotation
his Quotation
way Quotation
to Quotation
Kingston. Quotation
 Quotation
He Quotation
has Quotation
passed Quotation
you Quotation
very Quotation
often." Quotation
"That Quotation
may Quotation
be, Quotation
and Quotation
I Quotation
may Quotation
have Quotation
seen Quotation
him Quotation
fifty Quotation
times, Quotation
but Quotation
without Quotation
having Quotation
any Quotation
idea Quotation
of Quotation
his Quotation
name. Quotation
 Quotation
A Quotation
young Quotation
farmer, Quotation
whether Quotation
on Quotation
horseback Quotation
or Quotation
on Quotation
foot, Quotation
is Quotation
the Quotation
very Quotation
last Quotation
sort Quotation
of Quotation
person Quotation
to Quotation
raise Quotation
my Quotation
curiosity. Quotation
 Quotation
The Quotation
yeomanry Quotation
are Quotation
precisely Quotation
the Quotation
order Quotation
of Quotation
people Quotation
with Quotation
whom Quotation
I Quotation
feel Quotation
I Quotation
can Quotation
have Quotation
nothing Quotation
to Quotation
do. Quotation
 Quotation
A Quotation
degree Quotation
or Quotation
two Quotation
lower, Quotation
and Quotation
a Quotation
creditable Quotation
appearance Quotation
might Quotation
interest Quotation
me; Quotation
I Quotation
might Quotation
hope Quotation
to Quotation
be Quotation
useful Quotation
to Quotation
their Quotation
families Quotation
in Quotation
some Quotation
way Quotation
or Quotation
other. Quotation
 Quotation
But Quotation
a Quotation
farmer Quotation
can Quotation
need Quotation
none Quotation
of Quotation
my Quotation
help, Quotation
and Quotation
is, Quotation
therefore, Quotation
in Quotation
one Quotation
sense, Quotation
as Quotation
much Quotation
above Quotation
my Quotation
notice Quotation
as Quotation
in Quotation
every Quotation
other Quotation
he Quotation
is Quotation
below Quotation
it." Quotation
"To Quotation
be Quotation
sure. Quotation
 Quotation
Oh Quotation
yes! Quotation
It Quotation
is Quotation
not Quotation
likely Quotation
you Quotation
should Quotation
ever Quotation
have Quotation
observed Quotation
him; Quotation
but Quotation
he Quotation
knows Quotation
you Quotation
very Quotation
well Quotation
indeed Quotation
-- Quotation
I Quotation
mean Quotation
by Quotation
sight." Quotation
"I Quotation
have Quotation
no Quotation
doubt Quotation
of Quotation
his Quotation
being Quotation
a Quotation
very Quotation
respectable Quotation
young Quotation
man. Quotation
 Quotation
I Quotation
know, Quotation
indeed, Quotation
that Quotation
he Quotation
is Quotation
so, Quotation
and, Quotation
as Quotation
such, Quotation
wish Quotation
him Quotation
well. Quotation
 Quotation
What Quotation
do Quotation
you Quotation
imagine Quotation
his Quotation
age Quotation
to Quotation
be?" Quotation
"He Quotation
was Quotation
four-and-twentyDONEDET4388th Quotation
of Quotation
last Quotation
June, Quotation
and Quotation
my Quotation
birthday Quotation
isDONEDET44023rd Quotation
just Quotation
a Quotation
fortnight Quotation
and Quotation
a Quotation
day's Quotation
difference-- Quotation
which Quotation
is Quotation
very Quotation
odd." Quotation
"Only Quotation
four-and-twenty. Quotation
That Quotation
is Quotation
too Quotation
young Quotation
to Quotation
settle. Quotation
 Quotation
His Quotation
mother Quotation
is Quotation
perfectly Quotation
right Quotation
not Quotation
to Quotation
be Quotation
in Quotation
a Quotation
hurry. Quotation
 Quotation
They Quotation
seem Quotation
very Quotation
comfortable Quotation
as Quotation
they Quotation
are, Quotation
and Quotation
if Quotation
she Quotation
were Quotation
to Quotation
take Quotation
any Quotation
pains Quotation
to Quotation
marry Quotation
him, Quotation
she Quotation
would Quotation
probably Quotation
repent Quotation
it. Quotation
 Quotation
Six Quotation
years Quotation
hence, Quotation
if Quotation
he Quotation
could Quotation
meet Quotation
with Quotation
a Quotation
good Quotation
sort Quotation
of Quotation
young Quotation
woman Quotation
in Quotation
the Quotation
same Quotation
rank Quotation
as Quotation
his Quotation
own, Quotation
with Quotation
a Quotation
little Quotation
money, Quotation
it Quotation
might Quotation
be Quotation
very Quotation
desirable." Quotation
"Six Quotation
years Quotation
hence! Quotation
Dear Quotation
Miss Quotation
Woodhouse, Quotation
he Quotation
would Quotation
be Quotation
thirty Quotation
years Quotation
old!" Quotation
"Well, Quotation
and Quotation
that Quotation
is Quotation
as Quotation
early Quotation
as Quotation
most Quotation
men Quotation
can Quotation
afford Quotation
to Quotation
marry, Quotation
who Quotation
are Quotation
not Quotation
born Quotation
to Quotation
an Quotation
independence. Quotation
 Quotation
Mr. Quotation
Martin, Quotation
I Quotation
imagine, Quotation
has Quotation
his Quotation
fortune Quotation
entirely Quotation
to Quotation
make-- Quotation
cannot Quotation
be Quotation
at Quotation
all Quotation
beforehand Quotation
with Quotation
the Quotation
world. Quotation
 Quotation
Whatever Quotation
money Quotation
he Quotation
might Quotation
come Quotation
into Quotation
when Quotation
his Quotation
father Quotation
died, Quotation
whatever Quotation
his Quotation
share Quotation
of Quotation
the Quotation
family Quotation
property, Quotation
it Quotation
is, Quotation
I Quotation
dare Quotation
say, Quotation
all Quotation
afloat, Quotation
all Quotation
employed Quotation
in Quotation
his Quotation
stock, Quotation
and Quotation
so Quotation
forth; Quotation
and Quotation
though, Quotation
with Quotation
diligence Quotation
and Quotation
good Quotation
luck, Quotation
he Quotation
may Quotation
be Quotation
rich Quotation
in Quotation
time, Quotation
it Quotation
is Quotation
next Quotation
to Quotation
impossible Quotation
that Quotation
he Quotation
should Quotation
have Quotation
realised Quotation
any Quotation
thing Quotation
yet." Quotation
"To Quotation
be Quotation
sure, Quotation
so Quotation
it Quotation
is. Quotation
 Quotation
But Quotation
they Quotation
live Quotation
very Quotation
comfortably. Quotation
 Quotation
They Quotation
have Quotation
no Quotation
indoors Quotation
man, Quotation
else Quotation
they Quotation
do Quotation
not Quotation
want Quotation
for Quotation
any Quotation
thing; Quotation
and Quotation
Mrs. Quotation
Martin Quotation
talks Quotation
of Quotation
taking Quotation
a Quotation
boy Quotation
another Quotation
year." Quotation
"I Quotation
wish Quotation
you Quotation
may Quotation
not Quotation
get Quotation
into Quotation
a Quotation
scrape, Quotation
Harriet, Quotation
whenever Quotation
he Quotation
does Quotation
marry; Quotation
-- Quotation
I Quotation
mean, Quotation
as Quotation
to Quotation
being Quotation
acquainted Quotation
with Quotation
his Quotation
wife-- Quotation
for Quotation
though Quotation
his Quotation
sisters, Quotation
from Quotation
a Quotation
superior Quotation
education, Quotation
are Quotation
not Quotation
to Quotation
be Quotation
altogether Quotation
objected Quotation
to, Quotation
it Quotation
does Quotation
not Quotation
follow Quotation
that Quotation
he Quotation
might Quotation
marry Quotation
any Quotation
body Quotation
at Quotation
all Quotation
fit Quotation
for Quotation
you Quotation
to Quotation
notice. Quotation
 Quotation
The Quotation
misfortune Quotation
of Quotation
your Quotation
birth Quotation
ought Quotation
to Quotation
make Quotation
you Quotation
particularly Quotation
careful Quotation
as Quotation
to Quotation
your Quotation
associates. Quotation
 Quotation
There Quotation
can Quotation
be Quotation
no Quotation
doubt Quotation
of Quotation
your Quotation
being Quotation
a Quotation
gentleman's Quotation
daughter, Quotation
and Quotation
you Quotation
must Quotation
support Quotation
your Quotation
claim Quotation
to Quotation
that Quotation
station Quotation
by Quotation
every Quotation
thing Quotation
within Quotation
your Quotation
own Quotation
power, Quotation
or Quotation
there Quotation
will Quotation
be Quotation
plenty Quotation
of Quotation
people Quotation
who Quotation
would Quotation
take Quotation
pleasure Quotation
in Quotation
degrading Quotation
you." Quotation
"Yes, Quotation
to Quotation
be Quotation
sure, Quotation
I Quotation
suppose Quotation
there Quotation
are. Quotation
 Quotation
But Quotation
while Quotation
I Quotation
visit Quotation
at Quotation
Hartfield, Quotation
and Quotation
you Quotation
are Quotation
so Quotation
kind Quotation
to Quotation
me, Quotation
Miss Quotation
Woodhouse, Quotation
I Quotation
am Quotation
not Quotation
afraid Quotation
of Quotation
what Quotation
any Quotation
body Quotation
can Quotation
do." Quotation
"You Quotation
understand Quotation
the Quotation
force Quotation
of Quotation
influence Quotation
pretty Quotation
well, Quotation
Harriet; Quotation
but Quotation
I Quotation
would Quotation
have Quotation
you Quotation
so Quotation
firmly Quotation
established Quotation
in Quotation
good Quotation
society, Quotation
as Quotation
to Quotation
be Quotation
independent Quotation
even Quotation
of Quotation
Hartfield Quotation
and Quotation
Miss Quotation

 Quotation
I Quotation
want Quotation
to Quotation
see Quotation
you Quotation
permanently Quotation
well Quotation
connected, Quotation
and Quotation
to Quotation
that Quotation
end Quotation
it Quotation
will Quotation
be Quotation
advisable Quotation
to Quotation
have Quotation
as Quotation
few Quotation
odd Quotation
acquaintance Quotation
as Quotation
may Quotation
be; Quotation
and, Quotation
therefore, Quotation
I Quotation
say Quotation
that Quotation
if Quotation
you Quotation
should Quotation
still Quotation
be Quotation
in Quotation
this Quotation
country Quotation
when Quotation
Mr. Quotation
Martin Quotation
marries, Quotation
I Quotation
wish Quotation
you Quotation
may Quotation
not Quotation
be Quotation
drawn Quotation
in Quotation
by Quotation
your Quotation
intimacy Quotation
with Quotation
the Quotation
sisters, Quotation
to Quotation
be Quotation
acquainted Quotation
with Quotation
the Quotation
wife, Quotation
who Quotation
will Quotation
probably Quotation
be Quotation
some Quotation
mere Quotation
farmer's Quotation
daughter, Quotation
without Quotation
education." Quotation
"To Quotation
be Quotation
sure. Quotation
 Quotation
Yes. Quotation
 Quotation
Not Quotation
that Quotation
I Quotation
think Quotation
Mr. Quotation
Martin Quotation
would Quotation
ever Quotation
marry Quotation
any Quotation
body Quotation
but Quotation
what Quotation
had Quotation
had Quotation
some Quotation
education-- Quotation
and Quotation
been Quotation
very Quotation
well Quotation
brought Quotation
up. Quotation
However, Quotation
I Quotation
do Quotation
not Quotation
mean Quotation
to Quotation
set Quotation
up Quotation
my Quotation
opinion Quotation
against Quotation
yours-- Quotation
and Quotation
I Quotation
am Quotation
sure Quotation
I Quotation
shall Quotation
not Quotation
wish Quotation
for Quotation
the Quotation
acquaintance Quotation
of Quotation
his Quotation
wife. Quotation
 Quotation
I Quotation
shall Quotation
always Quotation
have Quotation
a Quotation
great Quotation
regard Quotation
for Quotation
the Quotation
Miss Quotation
Martins, Quotation
especially Quotation
Elizabeth, Quotation
and Quotation
should Quotation
be Quotation
very Quotation
sorry Quotation
to Quotation
give Quotation
them Quotation
up, Quotation
for Quotation
they Quotation
are Quotation
quite Quotation
as Quotation
well Quotation
educated Quotation
as Quotation
me. Quotation
 Quotation
But Quotation
if Quotation
he Quotation
marries Quotation
a Quotation
very Quotation
ignorant, Quotation
vulgar Quotation
woman, Quotation
certainly Quotation
I Quotation
had Quotation
better Quotation
not Quotation
visit Quotation
her, Quotation
if Quotation
I Quotation
can Quotation
help Quotation
it." Quotation
Emma O
watched O
her O
through O
the O
fluctuations O
of O
this O
speech, O
and O
saw O
no O
alarming O
symptoms O
of O
love. O
 O
The O
young O
man O
had O
been O
the O
first O
admirer, O
but O
she O
trusted O
there O
was O
no O
other O
hold, O
and O
that O
there O
would O
be O
no O
serious O
difficulty, O
on O
Harriet's O
side, O
to O
oppose O
any O
friendly O
arrangement O
of O
her O
own. O
They O
met O
Mr. O
Martin O
the O
very O
next O
day, O
as O
they O
were O
walking O
on O
the O
Donwell O
road. O
 O
He O
was O
on O
foot, O
and O
after O
looking O
very O
respectfully O
at O
her, O
looked O
with O
most O
unfeigned O
satisfaction O
at O
her O
companion. O
 O
Emma O
was O
not O
sorry O
to O
have O
such O
an O
opportunity O
of O
survey; O
and O
walking O
a O
few O
yards O
forward, O
while O
they O
talked O
together, O
soon O
made O
her O
quick O
eye O
sufficiently O
acquainted O
with O
Mr. O
Robert O
Martin. O
 O
His O
appearance O
was O
very O
neat, O
and O
he O
looked O
like O
a O
sensible O
young O
man, O
but O
his O
person O
had O
no O
other O
advantage; O
and O
when O
he O
came O
to O
be O
contrasted O
with O
gentlemen, O
she O
thought O
he O
must O
lose O
all O
the O
ground O
he O
had O
gained O
in O
Harriet's O
inclination. O
 O
Harriet O
was O
not O
insensible O
of O
manner; O
she O
had O
voluntarily O
noticed O
her O
father's O
gentleness O
with O
admiration O
as O
well O
as O
wonder. O
 O
Mr. O
Martin O
looked O
as O
if O
he O
did O
not O
know O
what O
manner O
was. O
They O
remained O
but O
a O
few O
minutes O
together, O
as O
Miss O
Woodhouse O
must O
not O
be O
kept O
waiting; O
and O
Harriet Entity
then O
came O
running O
to O
her O
with O
a O
smiling O
face, O
and O
in O
a O
flutter O
of O
spirits, O
which O
Miss Entity
Woodhouse Entity
hoped O
very O
soon O
to O
compose. O
"Only Quotation
think Quotation
of Quotation
our Quotation
happening Quotation
to Quotation
meet Quotation
him!-- Quotation
How Quotation
very Quotation
odd! Quotation
It Quotation
was Quotation
quite Quotation
a Quotation
chance, Quotation
he Quotation
said, Quotation
that Quotation
he Quotation
had Quotation
not Quotation
gone Quotation
round Quotation
by Quotation
Randalls. Quotation
 Quotation
He Quotation
did Quotation
not Quotation
think Quotation
we Quotation
ever Quotation
walked Quotation
this Quotation
road. Quotation
 Quotation
He Quotation
thought Quotation
we Quotation
walked Quotation
towards Quotation
Randalls Quotation
most Quotation
days. Quotation
 Quotation
He Quotation
has Quotation
not Quotation
been Quotation
able Quotation
to Quotation
get Quotation
the Quotation
Romance Quotation
of Quotation
the Quotation
Forest Quotation
yet. Quotation
He Quotation
was Quotation
so Quotation
busy Quotation
the Quotation
last Quotation
time Quotation
he Quotation
was Quotation
at Quotation
Kingston Quotation
that Quotation
he Quotation
quite Quotation
forgot Quotation
it, Quotation
but Quotation
he Quotation
goes Quotation
again Quotation
to-morrow. Quotation
 Quotation
So Quotation
very Quotation
odd Quotation
we Quotation
should Quotation
happen Quotation
to Quotation
meet! Quotation
Well, Quotation
Miss Quotation
Woodhouse, Quotation
is Quotation
he Quotation
like Quotation
what Quotation
you Quotation
expected? Quotation
What Quotation
do Quotation
you Quotation
think Quotation
of Quotation
him? Quotation
Do Quotation
you Quotation
think Quotation
him Quotation
so Quotation
very Quotation
plain?" Quotation
"He O
is O
very O
plain, O
undoubtedly-- O
remarkably O
plain:-- O
but O
that O
is O
nothing O
compared O
with O
his O
entire O
want O
of O
gentility. O
 O
I O
had O
no O
right O
to O
expect O
much, O
and O
I O
did O
not O
expect O
much; O
but O
I O
had O
no O
idea O
that O
he O
could O
be O
so O
very O
clownish, O
so O
totally O
without O
air. O
 O
I O
had O
imagined O
him, O
I O
confess, O
a O
degree O
or O
two O
nearer O
gentility." O
"To O
be O
sure," O
said O
Harriet, O
in O
a O
mortified O
voice, O
"he O
is O
not O
so O
genteel O
as O
real O
gentlemen." O
"I O
think, O
Harriet, O
since O
your O
acquaintance O
with O
us, O
you O
have O
been O
repeatedly O
in O
the O
company O
of O
some O
such O
very O
real O
gentlemen, O
that O
you O
must O
yourself O
be O
struck O
with O
the O
difference O
in O
Mr. O
Martin. O
 O
At O
Hartfield, O
you O
have O
had O
very O
good O
specimens O
of O
well O
educated, O
well O
bred O
men. O
 O
I O
should O
be O
surprized O
if, O
after O
seeing O
them, O
you O
could O
be O
in O
company O
with O
Mr. O
Martin O
again O
without O
perceiving O
him O
to O
be O
a O
very O
inferior O
creature-- O
and O
rather O
wondering O
at O
yourself O
for O
having O
ever O
thought O
him O
at O
all O
agreeable O
before. O
 O
Do O
not O
you O
begin O
to O
feel O
that O
now? O
Were O
not O
you O
struck? O
I O
am O
sure O
you O
must O
have O
been O
struck O
by O
his O
awkward O
look O
and O
abrupt O
manner, O
and O
the O
uncouthness O
of O
a O
voice O
which O
I O
heard O
to O
be O
wholly O
unmodulated O
as O
I O
stood O
here." O
"Certainly, O
he O
is O
not O
like O
Mr. O
Knightley. O
 O
He O
has O
not O
such O
a O
fine O
air O
and O
way O
of O
walking O
as O
Mr. O
Knightley. O
 O
I O
see O
the O
difference O
plain O
enough. O
 O
But O
Mr. O
Knightley O
is O
so O
very O
fine O
a O
man!" O
"Mr. O
Knightley's O
air O
is O
so O
remarkably O
good O
that O
it O
is O
not O
fair O
to O
compare O
Mr. O
Martin O
with O
him. O
 O
You O
might O
not O
see O
one O
in O
a O
hundred O
with O
gentleman O
so O
plainly O
written O
as O
in O
Mr. O
Knightley. O
 O
But O
he O
is O
not O
the O
only O
gentleman O
you O
have O
been O
lately O
used O
to. O
 O
What O
say O
you O
to O
Mr. O
Weston O
and O
Mr. O
Elton? O
Compare O
Mr. O
Martin O
with O
either O
of O
them. O
Compare O
their O
manner O
of O
carrying O
themselves; O
of O
walking; O
of O
speaking; O
of O
being O
silent. O
 O
You O
must O
see O
the O
difference." O
"Oh O
yes!-- O
there O
is O
a O
great O
difference. O
 O
But O
Mr. O
Weston O
is O
almost O
an O
old O
man. O
 O
Mr. O
Weston O
must O
be O
between O
forty O
and O
fifty." O
"Which O
makes O
his O
good O
manners O
the O
more O
valuable. O
 O
The O
older O
a O
person O
grows, O
Harriet, O
the O
more O
important O
it O
is O
that O
their O
manners O
should O
not O
be O
bad; O
the O
more O
glaring O
and O
disgusting O
any O
loudness, O
or O
coarseness, O
or O
awkwardness O
becomes. O
 O
What O
is O
passable O
in O
youth O
is O
detestable O
in O
later O
age. O
 O
Mr. O
Martin O
is O
now O
awkward O
and O
abrupt; O
what O
will O
he O
be O
at O
Mr. O
Weston's O
time O
of O
life?" O
"There O
is O
no O
saying, O
indeed," O
replied O
Harriet O
rather O
solemnly. O
"But O
there O
may O
be O
pretty O
good O
guessing. O
 O
He O
will O
be O
a O
completely O
gross, O
vulgar O
farmer, O
totally O
inattentive O
to O
appearances, O
and O
thinking O
of O
nothing O
but O
profit O
and O
loss." O
"Will O
he, O
indeed? O
That O
will O
be O
very O
bad." O
"How O
much O
his O
business O
engrosses O
him O
already O
is O
very O
plain O
from O
the O
circumstance O
of O
his O
forgetting O
to O
inquire O
for O
the O
book O
you O
recommended. O
He O
was O
a O
great O
deal O
too O
full O
of O
the O
market O
to O
think O
of O
any O
thing O
else-- O
which O
is O
just O
as O
it O
should O
be, O
for O
a O
thriving O
man. O
 O
What O
has O
he O
to O
do O
with O
books? O
And O
I O
have O
no O
doubt O
that O
he O
will O
thrive, O
and O
be O
a O
very O
rich O
man O
in O
time-- O
and O
his O
being O
illiterate O
and O
coarse O
need O
not O
disturb O
us." O
"I O
wonder O
he O
did O
not O
remember O
the O
book"-- O
was O
all O
Harriet's O
answer, O
and O
spoken O
with O
a O
degree O
of O
grave O
displeasure O
which O
Emma O
thought O
might O
be O
safely O
left O
to O
itself. O
 O
She, O
therefore, O
said O
no O
more O
for O
some O
time. O
Her O
next O
beginning O
was, O
"In O
one O
respect, O
perhaps, O
Mr. O
Elton's O
manners O
are O
superior O
to O
Mr. O
Knightley's O
or O
Mr. O
Weston's. O
They O
have O
more O
gentleness. O
 O
They O
might O
be O
more O
safely O
held O
up O
as O
a O
pattern. O
 O
There O
is O
an O
openness, O
a O
quickness, O
almost O
a O
bluntness O
in O
Mr. O
Weston, O
which O
every O
body O
likes O
in O
him, O
because O
there O
is O
so O
much O
good-humour O
with O
it-- O
but O
that O
would O
not O
do O
to O
be O
copied. O
 O
Neither O
would O
Mr. O
Knightley's O
downright, O
decided, O
commanding O
sort O
of O
manner, O
though O
it O
suits O
him O
very O
well; O
his O
figure, O
and O
look, O
and O
situation O
in O
life O
seem O
to O
allow O
it; O
but O
if O
any O
young O
man O
were O
to O
set O
about O
copying O
him, O
he O
would O
not O
be O
sufferable. O
 O
On O
the O
contrary, O
I O
think O
a O
young O
man O
might O
be O
very O
safely O
recommended O
to O
take O
Mr. O
Elton O
as O
a O
model. O
 O
Mr. O
Elton O
is O
good-humoured, O
cheerful, O
obliging, O
and O
gentle. O
 O
He O
seems O
to O
me O
to O
be O
grown O
particularly O
gentle O
of O
late. O
 O
I O
do O
not O
know O
whether O
he O
has O
any O
design O
of O
ingratiating O
himself O
with O
either O
of O
us, O
Harriet, O
by O
additional O
softness, O
but O
it O
strikes O
me O
that O
his O
manners O
are O
softer O
than O
they O
used O
to O
be. O
 O
If O
he O
means O
any O
thing, O
it O
must O
be O
to O
please O
you. O
 O
Did O
not O
I O
tell O
you O
what O
he O
said O
of O
you O
the O
other O
day?" O
She O
then O
repeated O
some O
warm O
personal O
praise O
which O
she O
had O
drawn O
from O
Mr. O
Elton, O
and O
now O
did O
full O
justice O
to; O
and O
Harriet O
blushed O
and O
smiled, O
and O
said O
she O
had O
always O
thought O
Mr. O
Elton O
very O
agreeable. O
Mr. O
Elton O
was O
the O
very O
person O
fixed O
on O
by O
Emma O
for O
driving O
the O
young O
farmer O
out O
of O
Harriet's O
head. O
 O
She O
thought O
it O
would O
be O
an O
excellent O
match; O
and O
only O
too O
palpably O
desirable, O
natural, O
and O
probable, O
for O
her O
to O
have O
much O
merit O
in O
planning O
it. O
 O
She O
feared O
it O
was O
what O
every O
body O
else O
must O
think O
of O
and O
predict. O
 O
It O
was O
not O
likely, O
however, O
that O
any O
body O
should O
have O
equalled O
her O
in O
the O
date O
of O
the O
plan, O
as O
it O
had O
entered O
her O
brain O
during O
the O
very O
first O
evening O
of O
Harriet's O
coming O
to O
Hartfield. O
 O
The O
longer O
she O
considered O
it, O
the O
greater O
was O
her O
sense O
of O
its O
expediency. O
 O
Mr. O
Elton's O
situation O
was O
most O
suitable, O
quite O
the O
gentleman O
himself, O
and O
without O
low O
connexions; O
at O
the O
same O
time, O
not O
of O
any O
family O
that O
could O
fairly O
object O
to O
the O
doubtful O
birth O
of O
Harriet. O
He O
had O
a O
comfortable O
home O
for O
her, O
and O
Emma O
imagined O
a O
very O
sufficient O
income; O
for O
though O
the O
vicarage O
of O
Highbury O
was O
not O
large, O
he O
was O
known O
to O
have O
some O
independent O
property; O
and O
she O
thought O
very O
highly O
of O
him O
as O
a O
good-humoured, O
well-meaning, O
respectable O
young O
man, O
without O
any O
deficiency O
of O
useful O
understanding O
or O
knowledge O
of O
the O
world. O
She O
had O
already O
satisfied O
herself O
that O
he O
thought O
Harriet O
a O
beautiful O
girl, O
which O
she O
trusted, O
with O
such O
frequent O
meetings O
at O
Hartfield, O
was O
foundation O
enough O
on O
his O
side; O
and O
on O
Harriet's O
there O
could O
be O
little O
doubt O
that O
the O
idea O
of O
being O
preferred O
by O
him O
would O
have O
all O
the O
usual O
weight O
and O
efficacy. O
 O
And O
he O
was O
really O
a O
very O
pleasing O
young O
man, O
a O
young O
man O
whom O
any O
woman O
not O
fastidious O
might O
like. O
 O
He O
was O
reckoned O
very O
handsome; O
his O
person O
much O
admired O
in O
general, O
though O
not O
by O
her, O
there O
being O
a O
want O
of O
elegance O
of O
feature O
which O
she O
could O
not O
dispense O
with:-- O
but O
the O
girl O
who O
could O
be O
gratified O
by O
a O
Robert O
Martin's O
riding O
about O
the O
country O
to O
get O
walnuts O
for O
her O
might O
very O
well O
be O
conquered O
by O
Mr. O
Elton's O
admiration. O
CHAPTER O
V O
"I O
do O
not O
know O
what O
your O
opinion O
may O
be, O
Mrs. O
Weston," O
said O
Mr. O
Knightley, O
"of O
this O
great O
intimacy O
between O
Emma O
and O
Harriet O
Smith, O
but O
I O
think O
it O
a O
bad O
thing." O
"A O
bad O
thing! O
Do O
you O
really O
think O
it O
a O
bad O
thing?-- O
why O
so?" O
"I O
think O
they O
will O
neither O
of O
them O
do O
the O
other O
any O
good." O
"You O
surprize O
me! O
Emma O
must O
do O
Harriet O
good: O
and O
by O
supplying O
her O
with O
a O
new O
object O
of O
interest, O
Harriet O
may O
be O
said O
to O
do O
Emma O
good. O
 O
I O
have O
been O
seeing O
their O
intimacy O
with O
the O
greatest O
pleasure. O
 O
How O
very O
differently O
we O
feel!-- O
Not O
think O
they O
will O
do O
each O
other O
any O
good! O
This O
will O
certainly O
be O
the O
beginning O
of O
one O
of O
our O
quarrels O
about O
Emma, O
Mr. O
Knightley." O
"Perhaps O
you O
think O
I O
am O
come O
on O
purpose O
to O
quarrel O
with O
you, O
knowing O
Weston O
to O
be O
out, O
and O
that O
you O
must O
still O
fight O
your O
own O
battle." O
"Mr. O
Weston O
would O
undoubtedly O
support O
me, O
if O
he O
were O
here, O
for O
he O
thinks O
exactly O
as O
I O
do O
on O
the O
subject. O
 O
We O
were O
speaking O
of O
it O
only O
yesterday, O
and O
agreeing O
how O
fortunate O
it O
was O
for O
Emma, O
that O
there O
should O
be O
such O
a O
girl O
in O
Highbury O
for O
her O
to O
associate O
with. O
 O
Mr. O
Knightley, O
I O
shall O
not O
allow O
you O
to O
be O
a O
fair O
judge O
in O
this O
case. O
 O
You O
are O
so O
much O
used O
to O
live O
alone, O
that O
you O
do O
not O
know O
the O
value O
of O
a O
companion; O
and, O
perhaps O
no O
man O
can O
be O
a O
good O
judge O
of O
the O
comfort O
a O
woman O
feels O
in O
the O
society O
of O
one O
of O
her O
own O
sex, O
after O
being O
used O
to O
it O
all O
her O
life. O
 O
I O
can O
imagine O
your O
objection O
to O
Harriet O
Smith. O
 O
She O
is O
not O
the O
superior O
young O
woman O
which O
Emma's O
friend O
ought O
to O
be. O
 O
But O
on O
the O
other O
hand, O
as O
Emma O
wants O
to O
see O
her O
better O
informed, O
it O
will O
be O
an O
inducement O
to O
her O
to O
read O
more O
herself. O
 O
They O
will O
read O
together. O
She O
means O
it, O
I O
know." O
"Emma O
has O
been O
meaning O
to O
read O
more O
ever O
since O
she O
was O
twelve O
years O
old. O
 O
I O
have O
seen O
a O
great O
many O
lists O
of O
her O
drawing-up O
at O
various O
times O
of O
books O
that O
she O
meant O
to O
read O
regularly O
through-- O
and O
very O
good O
lists O
they O
were-- O
very O
well O
chosen, O
and O
very O
neatly O
arranged-- O
sometimes O
alphabetically, O
and O
sometimes O
by O
some O
other O
rule. O
 O
The O
list O
she O
drew O
up O
when O
only O
fourteen O
-- O
I O
remember O
thinking O
it O
did O
her O
judgment O
so O
much O
credit, O
that O
I O
preserved O
it O
some O
time; O
and O
I O
dare O
say O
she O
may O
have O
made O
out O
a O
very O
good O
list O
now. O
 O
But O
I O
have O
done O
with O
expecting O
any O
course O
of O
steady O
reading O
from O
Emma. O
 O
She O
will O
never O
submit O
to O
any O
thing O
requiring O
industry O
and O
patience, O
and O
a O
subjection O
of O
the O
fancy O
to O
the O
understanding. O
 O
Where O
Miss O
Taylor O
failed O
to O
stimulate, O
I O
may O
safely O
affirm O
that O
Harriet O
Smith O
will O
do O
nothing.-- O
You O
never O
could O
persuade O
her O
to O
read O
half O
so O
much O
as O
you O
wished.-- O
You O
know O
you O
could O
not." O
"I O
dare O
say," O
replied O
Mrs. O
Weston, O
smiling, O
"that O
I O
thought O
so O
then;-- O
but O
since O
we O
have O
parted, O
I O
can O
never O
remember O
Emma's O
omitting O
to O
do O
any O
thing O
I O
wished." O
"There O
is O
hardly O
any O
desiring O
to O
refresh O
such O
a O
memory O
as O
that,"-- O
said O
Mr. O
Knightley, O
feelingly; O
and O
for O
a O
moment O
or O
two O
he O
had O
done. O
 O
"But O
I," O
he O
soon O
added, O
"who O
have O
had O
no O
such O
charm O
thrown O
over O
my O
senses, O
must O
still O
see, O
hear, O
and O
remember. O
 O
Emma O
is O
spoiled O
by O
being O
the O
cleverest O
of O
her O
family. O
 O
At O
ten O
years O
old, O
she O
had O
the O
misfortune O
of O
being O
able O
to O
answer O
questions O
which O
puzzled O
her O
sister O
at O
seventeen. O
 O
She O
was O
always O
quick O
and O
assured: O
Isabella O
slow O
and O
diffident. O
 O
And O
ever O
since O
she O
was O
twelve, O
Emma O
has O
been O
mistress O
of O
the O
house O
and O
of O
you O
all. O
 O
In O
her O
mother O
she O
lost O
the O
only O
person O
able O
to O
cope O
with O
her. O
 O
She O
inherits O
her O
mother's O
talents, O
and O
must O
have O
been O
under O
subjection O
to O
her." O
"I O
should O
have O
been O
sorry, O
Mr. O
Knightley, O
to O
be O
dependent O
on O
your O
recommendation, O
had O
I O
quitted O
Mr. O
Woodhouse's O
family O
and O
wanted O
another O
situation; O
I O
do O
not O
think O
you O
would O
have O
spoken O
a O
good O
word O
for O
me O
to O
any O
body. O
 O
I O
am O
sure O
you O
always O
thought O
me O
unfit O
for O
the O
office O
I O
held." O
"Yes," O
said O
he, O
smiling. O
 O
"You O
are O
better O
placed O
here; O
very O
fit O
for O
a O
wife, O
but O
not O
at O
all O
for O
a O
governess. O
 O
But O
you O
were O
preparing O
yourself O
to O
be O
an O
excellent O
wife O
all O
the O
time O
you O
were O
at O
Hartfield. O
 O
You O
might O
not O
give O
Emma O
such O
a O
complete O
education O
as O
your O
powers O
would O
seem O
to O
promise; O
but O
you O
were O
receiving O
a O
very O
good O
education O
from O
her, O
on O
the O
very O
material O
matrimonial O
point O
of O
submitting O
your O
own O
will, O
and O
doing O
as O
you O
were O
bid; O
and O
if O
Weston O
had O
asked O
me O
to O
recommend O
him O
a O
wife, O
I O
should O
certainly O
have O
named O
Miss O
Taylor." O
"Thank O
you. O
 O
There O
will O
be O
very O
little O
merit O
in O
making O
a O
good O
wife O
to O
such O
a O
man O
as O
Mr. O
Weston." O
"Why, O
to O
own O
the O
truth, O
I O
am O
afraid O
you O
are O
rather O
thrown O
away, O
and O
that O
with O
every O
disposition O
to O
bear, O
there O
will O
be O
nothing O
to O
be O
borne. O
We O
will O
not O
despair, O
however. O
 O
Weston O
may O
grow O
cross O
from O
the O
wantonness O
of O
comfort, O
or O
his O
son O
may O
plague O
him." O
"I O
hope O
not O
that.-- O
It O
is O
not O
likely. O
 O
No, O
Mr. O
Knightley, O
do O
not O
foretell O
vexation O
from O
that O
quarter." O
"Not O
I, O
indeed. O
 O
I O
only O
name O
possibilities. O
 O
I O
do O
not O
pretend O
to O
Emma's O
genius O
for O
foretelling O
and O
guessing. O
 O
I O
hope, O
with O
all O
my O
heart, O
the O
young O
man O
may O
be O
a O
Weston O
in O
merit, O
and O
a O
Churchill O
in O
fortune.-- O
But O
Harriet O
Smith O
-- O
I O
have O
not O
half O
done O
about O
Harriet O
Smith. O
 O
I O
think O
her O
the O
very O
worst O
sort O
of O
companion O
that O
Emma O
could O
possibly O
have. O
 O
She O
knows O
nothing O
herself, O
and O
looks O
upon O
Emma O
as O
knowing O
every O
thing. O
 O
She O
is O
a O
flatterer O
in O
all O
her O
ways; O
and O
so O
much O
the O
worse, O
because O
undesigned. O
 O
Her O
ignorance O
is O
hourly O
flattery. O
 O
How O
can O
Emma O
imagine O
she O
has O
any O
thing O
to O
learn O
herself, O
while O
Harriet O
is O
presenting O
such O
a O
delightful O
inferiority? O
And O
as O
for O
Harriet, O
I O
will O
venture O
to O
say O
that O
she O
cannot O
gain O
by O
the O
acquaintance. O
 O
Hartfield O
will O
only O
put O
her O
out O
of O
conceit O
with O
all O
the O
other O
places O
she O
belongs O
to. O
 O
She O
will O
grow O
just O
refined O
enough O
to O
be O
uncomfortable O
with O
those O
among O
whom O
birth O
and O
circumstances O
have O
placed O
her O
home. O
 O
I O
am O
much O
mistaken O
if O
Emma's O
doctrines O
give O
any O
strength O
of O
mind, O
or O
tend O
at O
all O
to O
make O
a O
girl O
adapt O
herself O
rationally O
to O
the O
varieties O
of O
her O
situation O
in O
life.-- O
They O
only O
give O
a O
little O
polish." O
"I O
either O
depend O
more O
upon O
Emma's O
good O
sense O
than O
you O
do, O
or O
am O
more O
anxious O
for O
her O
present O
comfort; O
for O
I O
cannot O
lament O
the O
acquaintance. O
How O
well O
she O
looked O
last O
night!" O
"Oh! O
you O
would O
rather O
talk O
of O
her O
person O
than O
her O
mind, O
would O
you? O
Very O
well; O
I O
shall O
not O
attempt O
to O
deny O
Emma's O
being O
pretty." O
"Pretty! O
say O
beautiful O
rather. O
 O
Can O
you O
imagine O
any O
thing O
nearer O
perfect O
beauty O
than O
Emma O
altogether-- O
face O
and O
figure?" O
"I O
do O
not O
know O
what O
I O
could O
imagine, O
but O
I O
confess O
that O
I O
have O
seldom O
seen O
a O
face O
or O
figure O
more O
pleasing O
to O
me O
than O
hers. O
 O
But O
I O
am O
a O
partial O
old O
friend." O
"Such O
an O
eye!-- O
the O
true O
hazle O
eye-- O
and O
so O
brilliant! O
regular O
features, O
open O
countenance, O
with O
a O
complexion! O
oh! O
what O
a O
bloom O
of O
full O
health, O
and O
such O
a O
pretty O
height O
and O
size; O
such O
a O
firm O
and O
upright O
figure! O
There O
is O
health, O
not O
merely O
in O
her O
bloom, O
but O
in O
her O
air, O
her O
head, O
her O
glance. O
 O
One O
hears O
sometimes O
of O
a O
child O
being O
'the O
picture O
of O
health;' O
now, O
Emma O
always O
gives O
me O
the O
idea O
of O
being O
the O
complete O
picture O
of O
grown-up O
health. O
 O
She O
is O
loveliness O
itself. O
 O
Mr. O
Knightley, O
is O
not O
she?" O
"I O
have O
not O
a O
fault O
to O
find O
with O
her O
person," O
he O
replied. O
 O
"I O
think O
her O
all O
you O
describe. O
 O
I O
love O
to O
look O
at O
her; O
and O
I O
will O
add O
this O
praise, O
that O
I O
do O
not O
think O
her O
personally O
vain. O
 O
Considering O
how O
very O
handsome O
she O
is, O
she O
appears O
to O
be O
little O
occupied O
with O
it; O
her O
vanity O
lies O
another O
way. O
 O
Mrs. O
Weston, O
I O
am O
not O
to O
be O
talked O
out O
of O
my O
dislike O
of O
Harriet O
Smith, O
or O
my O
dread O
of O
its O
doing O
them O
both O
harm." O
"And O
I, O
Mr. O
Knightley, O
am O
equally O
stout O
in O
my O
confidence O
of O
its O
not O
doing O
them O
any O
harm. O
 O
With O
all O
dear O
Emma's O
little O
faults, O
she O
is O
an O
excellent O
creature. O
 O
Where O
shall O
we O
see O
a O
better O
daughter, O
or O
a O
kinder O
sister, O
or O
a O
truer O
friend? O
No, O
no; O
she O
has O
qualities O
which O
may O
be O
trusted; O
she O
will O
never O
lead O
any O
one O
really O
wrong; O
she O
will O
make O
no O
lasting O
blunder; O
where O
Emma O
errs O
once, O
she O
is O
in O
the O
right O
a O
hundred O
times." O
"Very O
well; O
I O
will O
not O
plague O
you O
any O
more. O
 O
Emma O
shall O
be O
an O
angel, O
and O
I O
will O
keep O
my O
spleen O
to O
myself O
till O
Christmas O
brings O
John O
and O
Isabella. O
 O
John O
loves O
Emma O
with O
a O
reasonable O
and O
therefore O
not O
a O
blind O
affection, O
and O
Isabella O
always O
thinks O
as O
he O
does; O
except O
when O
he O
is O
not O
quite O
frightened O
enough O
about O
the O
children. O
 O
I O
am O
sure O
of O
having O
their O
opinions O
with O
me." O
"I O
know O
that O
you O
all O
love O
her O
really O
too O
well O
to O
be O
unjust O
or O
unkind; O
but O
excuse O
me, O
Mr. O
Knightley, O
if O
I O
take O
the O
liberty O
(I O
consider O
myself, O
you O
know, O
as O
having O
somewhat O
of O
the O
privilege O
of O
speech O
that O
Emma's O
mother O
might O
have O
had) O
the O
liberty O
of O
hinting O
that O
I O
do O
not O
think O
any O
possible O
good O
can O
arise O
from O
Harriet O
Smith's O
intimacy O
being O
made O
a O
matter O
of O
much O
discussion O
among O
you. O
 O
Pray O
excuse O
me; O
but O
supposing O
any O
little O
inconvenience O
may O
be O
apprehended O
from O
the O
intimacy, O
it O
cannot O
be O
expected O
that O
Emma, O
accountable O
to O
nobody O
but O
her O
father, O
who O
perfectly O
approves O
the O
acquaintance, O
should O
put O
an O
end O
to O
it, O
so O
long O
as O
it O
is O
a O
source O
of O
pleasure O
to O
herself. O
 O
It O
has O
been O
so O
many O
years O
my O
province O
to O
give O
advice, O
that O
you O
cannot O
be O
surprized, O
Mr. O
Knightley, O
at O
this O
little O
remains O
of O
office." O
"Not O
at O
all," O
cried O
he; O
"I O
am O
much O
obliged O
to O
you O
for O
it. O
 O
It O
is O
very O
good O
advice, O
and O
it O
shall O
have O
a O
better O
fate O
than O
your O
advice O
has O
often O
found; O
for O
it O
shall O
be O
attended O
to." O
"Mrs. O
John O
Knightley O
is O
easily O
alarmed, O
and O
might O
be O
made O
unhappy O
about O
her O
sister." O
"Be O
satisfied," O
said O
he, O
"I O
will O
not O
raise O
any O
outcry. O
 O
I O
will O
keep O
my O
ill-humour O
to O
myself. O
 O
I O
have O
a O
very O
sincere O
interest O
in O
Emma. O
Isabella O
does O
not O
seem O
more O
my O
sister; O
has O
never O
excited O
a O
greater O
interest; O
perhaps O
hardly O
so O
great. O
 O
There O
is O
an O
anxiety, O
a O
curiosity O
in O
what O
one O
feels O
for O
Emma. O
 O
I O
wonder O
what O
will O
become O
of O
her!" O
"So O
do O
I," O
said O
Mrs. O
Weston O
gently, O
"very O
much." O
"She O
always O
declares O
she O
will O
never O
marry, O
which, O
of O
course, O
means O
just O
nothing O
at O
all. O
 O
But O
I O
have O
no O
idea O
that O
she O
has O
yet O
ever O
seen O
a O
man O
she O
cared O
for. O
 O
It O
would O
not O
be O
a O
bad O
thing O
for O
her O
to O
be O
very O
much O
in O
love O
with O
a O
proper O
object. O
 O
I O
should O
like O
to O
see O
Emma O
in O
love, O
and O
in O
some O
doubt O
of O
a O
return; O
it O
would O
do O
her O
good. O
 O
But O
there O
is O
nobody O
hereabouts O
to O
attach O
her; O
and O
she O
goes O
so O
seldom O
from O
home." O
"There O
does, O
indeed, O
seem O
as O
little O
to O
tempt O
her O
to O
break O
her O
resolution O
at O
present," O
said O
Mrs. O
Weston, O
"as O
can O
well O
be; O
and O
while O
she O
is O
so O
happy O
at O
Hartfield, O
I O
cannot O
wish O
her O
to O
be O
forming O
any O
attachment O
which O
would O
be O
creating O
such O
difficulties O
on O
poor O
Mr. O
Woodhouse's O
account. O
 O
I O
do O
not O
recommend O
matrimony O
at O
present O
to O
Emma, O
though O
I O
mean O
no O
slight O
to O
the O
state, O
I O
assure O
you." O
Part O
of O
her O
meaning O
was O
to O
conceal O
some O
favourite O
thoughts O
of O
her O
own O
and O
Mr. O
Weston's O
on O
the O
subject, O
as O
much O
as O
possible. O
 O
There O
were O
wishes O
at O
Randalls O
respecting O
Emma's O
destiny, O
but O
it O
was O
not O
desirable O
to O
have O
them O
suspected; O
and O
the O
quiet O
transition O
which O
Mr. O
Knightley O
soon O
afterwards O
made O
to O
"What O
does O
Weston O
think O
of O
the O
weather; O
shall O
we O
have O
rain?" O
convinced O
her O
that O
he O
had O
nothing O
more O
to O
say O
or O
surmise O
about O
Hartfield. O
CHAPTER O
VI O
Emma O
could O
not O
feel O
a O
doubt O
of O
having O
given O
Harriet's O
fancy O
a O
proper O
direction O
and O
raised O
the O
gratitude O
of O
her O
young O
vanity O
to O
a O
very O
good O
purpose, O
for O
she O
found O
her O
decidedly O
more O
sensible O
than O
before O
of O
Mr. O
Elton's O
being O
a O
remarkably O
handsome O
man, O
with O
most O
agreeable O
manners; O
and O
as O
she O
had O
no O
hesitation O
in O
following O
up O
the O
assurance O
of O
his O
admiration O
by O
agreeable O
hints, O
she O
was O
soon O
pretty O
confident O
of O
creating O
as O
much O
liking O
on O
Harriet's O
side, O
as O
there O
could O
be O
any O
occasion O
for. O
 O
She O
was O
quite O
convinced O
of O
Mr. O
Elton's O
being O
in O
the O
fairest O
way O
of O
falling O
in O
love, O
if O
not O
in O
love O
already. O
 O
She O
had O
no O
scruple O
with O
regard O
to O
him. O
 O
He O
talked O
of O
Harriet, O
and O
praised O
her O
so O
warmly, O
that O
she O
could O
not O
suppose O
any O
thing O
wanting O
which O
a O
little O
time O
would O
not O
add. O
 O
His O
perception O
of O
the O
striking O
improvement O
of O
Harriet's O
manner, O
since O
her O
introduction O
at O
Hartfield, O
was O
not O
one O
of O
the O
least O
agreeable O
proofs O
of O
his O
growing O
attachment. O
"You O
have O
given O
Miss O
Smith O
all O
that O
she O
required," O
said O
he; O
"you O
have O
made O
her O
graceful O
and O
easy. O
 O
She O
was O
a O
beautiful O
creature O
when O
she O
came O
to O
you, O
but, O
in O
my O
opinion, O
the O
attractions O
you O
have O
added O
are O
infinitely O
superior O
to O
what O
she O
received O
from O
nature." O
"I O
am O
glad O
you O
think O
I O
have O
been O
useful O
to O
her; O
but O
Harriet O
only O
wanted O
drawing O
out, O
and O
receiving O
a O
few, O
very O
few O
hints. O
 O
She O
had O
all O
the O
natural O
grace O
of O
sweetness O
of O
temper O
and O
artlessness O
in O
herself. O
 O
I O
have O
done O
very O
little." O
"If O
it O
were O
admissible O
to O
contradict O
a O
lady," O
said O
the O
gallant O
Mr. O
ELTON-- O
"I O
have O
perhaps O
given O
her O
a O
little O
more O
decision O
of O
character, O
have O
taught O
her O
to O
think O
on O
points O
which O
had O
not O
fallen O
in O
her O
way O
before." O
"Exactly O
so; O
that O
is O
what O
principally O
strikes O
me. O
 O
So O
much O
superadded O
decision O
of O
character! O
Skilful O
has O
been O
the O
hand!" O
"Great O
has O
been O
the O
pleasure, O
I O
am O
sure. O
 O
I O
never O
met O
with O
a O
disposition O
more O
truly O
amiable." O
"I O
have O
no O
doubt O
of O
it." O
And O
it O
was O
spoken O
with O
a O
sort O
of O
sighing O
animation, O
which O
had O
a O
vast O
deal O
of O
the O
lover. O
 O
She O
was O
not O
less O
pleased O
another O
day O
with O
the O
manner O
in O
which O
he O
seconded O
a O
sudden O
wish O
of O
hers, O
to O
have O
Harriet's O
picture. O
"Did O
you O
ever O
have O
your O
likeness O
taken, O
Harriet?" O
said O
she: O
"did O
you O
ever O
sit O
for O
your O
picture?" O
Harriet O
was O
on O
the O
point O
of O
leaving O
the O
room, O
and O
only O
stopt O
to O
say, O
with O
a O
very O
interesting O
naivete, O
"Oh! O
dear, O
no, O
never." O
No O
sooner O
was O
she O
out O
of O
sight, O
than O
Emma O
exclaimed, O
"What O
an O
exquisite O
possession O
a O
good O
picture O
of O
her O
would O
be! O
I O
would O
give O
any O
money O
for O
it. O
 O
I O
almost O
long O
to O
attempt O
her O
likeness O
myself. O
You O
do O
not O
know O
it O
I O
dare O
say, O
but O
two O
or O
three O
years O
ago O
I O
had O
a O
great O
passion O
for O
taking O
likenesses, O
and O
attempted O
several O
of O
my O
friends, O
and O
was O
thought O
to O
have O
a O
tolerable O
eye O
in O
general. O
 O
But O
from O
one O
cause O
or O
another, O
I O
gave O
it O
up O
in O
disgust. O
 O
But O
really, O
I O
could O
almost O
venture, O
if O
Harriet O
would O
sit O
to O
me. O
 O
It O
would O
be O
such O
a O
delight O
to O
have O
her O
picture!" O
"Let O
me O
entreat O
you," O
cried O
Mr. O
Elton; O
"it O
would O
indeed O
be O
a O
delight! O
Let O
me O
entreat O
you, O
Miss O
Woodhouse, O
to O
exercise O
so O
charming O
a O
talent O
in O
favour O
of O
your O
friend. O
 O
I O
know O
what O
your O
drawings O
are. O
 O
How O
could O
you O
suppose O
me O
ignorant? O
Is O
not O
this O
room O
rich O
in O
specimens O
of O
your O
landscapes O
and O
flowers; O
and O
has O
not O
Mrs. O
Weston O
some O
inimitable O
figure-pieces O
in O
her O
drawing-room, O
at O
Randalls?" O
Yes, O
good O
man!-- O
thought O
Emma-- O
but O
what O
has O
all O
that O
to O
do O
with O
taking O
likenesses? O
You O
know O
nothing O
of O
drawing. O
 O
Don't O
pretend O
to O
be O
in O
raptures O
about O
mine. O
 O
Keep O
your O
raptures O
for O
Harriet's O
face. O
 O
"Well, O
if O
you O
give O
me O
such O
kind O
encouragement, O
Mr. O
Elton, O
I O
believe O
I O
shall O
try O
what O
I O
can O
do. O
 O
Harriet's O
features O
are O
very O
delicate, O
which O
makes O
a O
likeness O
difficult; O
and O
yet O
there O
is O
a O
peculiarity O
in O
the O
shape O
of O
the O
eye O
and O
the O
lines O
about O
the O
mouth O
which O
one O
ought O
to O
catch." O
"Exactly O
so-- O
The O
shape O
of O
the O
eye O
and O
the O
lines O
about O
the O
mouth O
-- O
I O
have O
not O
a O
doubt O
of O
your O
success. O
 O
Pray, O
pray O
attempt O
it. O
 O
As O
you O
will O
do O
it, O
it O
will O
indeed, O
to O
use O
your O
own O
words, O
be O
an O
exquisite O
possession." O
"But O
I O
am O
afraid, O
Mr. O
Elton, O
Harriet O
will O
not O
like O
to O
sit. O
 O
She O
thinks O
so O
little O
of O
her O
own O
beauty. O
 O
Did O
not O
you O
observe O
her O
manner O
of O
answering O
me? O
How O
completely O
it O
meant, O
'why O
should O
my O
picture O
be O
drawn?'" O
"Oh! O
yes, O
I O
observed O
it, O
I O
assure O
you. O
 O
It O
was O
not O
lost O
on O
me. O
 O
But O
still O
I O
cannot O
imagine O
she O
would O
not O
be O
persuaded." O
Harriet O
was O
soon O
back O
again, O
and O
the O
proposal O
almost O
immediately O
made; O
and O
she O
had O
no O
scruples O
which O
could O
stand O
many O
minutes O
against O
the O
earnest O
pressing O
of O
both O
the O
others. O
 O
Emma O
wished O
to O
go O
to O
work O
directly, O
and O
therefore O
produced O
the O
portfolio O
containing O
her O
various O
attempts O
at O
portraits, O
for O
not O
one O
of O
them O
had O
ever O
been O
finished, O
that O
they O
might O
decide O
together O
on O
the O
best O
size O
for O
Harriet. O
 O
Her O
many O
beginnings O
were O
displayed. O
 O
Miniatures, O
half-lengths, O
whole-lengths, O
pencil, O
crayon, O
and O
water-colours O
had O
been O
all O
tried O
in O
turn. O
 O
She O
had O
always O
wanted O
to O
do O
every O
thing, O
and O
had O
made O
more O
progress O
both O
in O
drawing O
and O
music O
than O
many O
might O
have O
done O
with O
so O
little O
labour O
as O
she O
would O
ever O
submit O
to. O
 O
She O
played O
and O
sang;-- O
and O
drew O
in O
almost O
every O
style; O
but O
steadiness O
had O
always O
been O
wanting; O
and O
in O
nothing O
had O
she O
approached O
the O
degree O
of O
excellence O
which O
she O
would O
have O
been O
glad O
to O
command, O
and O
ought O
not O
to O
have O
failed O
of. O
 O
She O
was O
not O
much O
deceived O
as O
to O
her O
own O
skill O
either O
as O
an O
artist O
or O
a O
musician, O
but O
she O
was O
not O
unwilling O
to O
have O
others O
deceived, O
or O
sorry O
to O
know O
her O
reputation O
for O
accomplishment O
often O
higher O
than O
it O
deserved. O
There O
was O
merit O
in O
every O
drawing-- O
in O
the O
least O
finished, O
perhaps O
the O
most; O
her O
style O
was O
spirited; O
but O
had O
there O
been O
much O
less, O
or O
had O
there O
been O
ten O
times O
more, O
the O
delight O
and O
admiration O
of O
her O
two O
companions O
would O
have O
been O
the O
same. O
 O
They O
were O
both O
in O
ecstasies. O
 O
A O
likeness O
pleases O
every O
body; O
and O
Miss O
Woodhouse's O
performances O
must O
be O
capital. O
"No O
great O
variety O
of O
faces O
for O
you," O
said O
Emma. O
 O
"I O
had O
only O
my O
own O
family O
to O
study O
from. O
 O
There O
is O
my O
father-- O
another O
of O
my O
father-- O
but O
the O
idea O
of O
sitting O
for O
his O
picture O
made O
him O
so O
nervous, O
that O
I O
could O
only O
take O
him O
by O
stealth; O
neither O
of O
them O
very O
like O
therefore. O
 O
Mrs. O
Weston O
again, O
and O
again, O
and O
again, O
you O
see. O
 O
Dear O
Mrs. O
Weston! O
always O
my O
kindest O
friend O
on O
every O
occasion. O
 O
She O
would O
sit O
whenever O
I O
asked O
her. O
 O
There O
is O
my O
sister; O
and O
really O
quite O
her O
own O
little O
elegant O
figure!-- O
and O
the O
face O
not O
unlike. O
 O
I O
should O
have O
made O
a O
good O
likeness O
of O
her, O
if O
she O
would O
have O
sat O
longer, O
but O
she O
was O
in O
such O
a O
hurry O
to O
have O
me O
draw O
her O
four O
children O
that O
she O
would O
not O
be O
quiet. O
 O
Then, O
here O
come O
all O
my O
attempts O
at O
three O
of O
those O
four O
children;-- O
there O
they O
are, O
Henry O
and O
John O
and O
Bella, O
from O
one O
end O
of O
the O
sheet O
to O
the O
other, O
and O
any O
one O
of O
them O
might O
do O
for O
any O
one O
of O
the O
rest. O
 O
She O
was O
so O
eager O
to O
have O
them O
drawn O
that O
I O
could O
not O
refuse; O
but O
there O
is O
no O
making O
children O
of O
three O
or O
four O
years O
old O
stand O
still O
you O
know; O
nor O
can O
it O
be O
very O
easy O
to O
take O
any O
likeness O
of O
them, O
beyond O
the O
air O
and O
complexion, O
unless O
they O
are O
coarser O
featured O
than O
any O
of O
mama's O
children O
ever O
were. O
Here O
is O
my O
sketch O
of O
the O
fourth, O
who O
was O
a O
baby. O
 O
I O
took O
him O
as O
he O
was O
sleeping O
on O
the O
sofa, O
and O
it O
is O
as O
strong O
a O
likeness O
of O
his O
cockade O
as O
you O
would O
wish O
to O
see. O
 O
He O
had O
nestled O
down O
his O
head O
most O
conveniently. O
That's O
very O
like. O
 O
I O
am O
rather O
proud O
of O
little O
George. O
 O
The O
corner O
of O
the O
sofa O
is O
very O
good. O
 O
Then O
here O
is O
my O
last,"-- O
unclosing O
a O
pretty O
sketch O
of O
a O
gentleman O
in O
small O
size, O
whole-length-- O
"my O
last O
and O
my O
best-- O
my O
brother, O
Mr. O
John O
Knightley.-- O
This O
did O
not O
want O
much O
of O
being O
finished, O
when O
I O
put O
it O
away O
in O
a O
pet, O
and O
vowed O
I O
would O
never O
take O
another O
likeness. O
 O
I O
could O
not O
help O
being O
provoked; O
for O
after O
all O
my O
pains, O
and O
when O
I O
had O
really O
made O
a O
very O
good O
likeness O
of O
it-- O
(Mrs. O
Weston O
and O
I O
were O
quite O
agreed O
in O
thinking O
it O
very O
like)-- O
only O
too O
handsome-- O
too O
flattering-- O
but O
that O
was O
a O
fault O
on O
the O
right O
side-- O
after O
all O
this, O
came O
poor O
dear O
Isabella's O
cold O
approbation O
of-- O
"Yes, O
it O
was O
a O
little O
like-- O
but O
to O
be O
sure O
it O
did O
not O
do O
him O
justice." O
We O
had O
had O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
trouble O
in O
persuading O
him O
to O
sit O
at O
all. O
 O
It O
was O
made O
a O
great O
favour O
of; O
and O
altogether O
it O
was O
more O
than O
I O
could O
bear; O
and O
so O
I O
never O
would O
finish O
it, O
to O
have O
it O
apologised O
over O
as O
an O
unfavourable O
likeness, O
to O
every O
morning O
visitor O
in O
Brunswick O
Square;-- O
and, O
as O
I O
said, O
I O
did O
then O
forswear O
ever O
drawing O
any O
body O
again. O
 O
But O
for O
Harriet's O
sake, O
or O
rather O
for O
my O
own, O
and O
as O
there O
are O
no O
husbands O
and O
wives O
in O
the O
case O
at O
present, O
I O
will O
break O
my O
resolution O
now." O
Mr. O
Elton O
seemed O
very O
properly O
struck O
and O
delighted O
by O
the O
idea, O
and O
was O
repeating, O
"No O
husbands O
and O
wives O
in O
the O
case O
at O
present O
indeed, O
as O
you O
observe. O
 O
Exactly O
so. O
 O
No O
husbands O
and O
wives," O
with O
so O
interesting O
a O
consciousness, O
that O
Emma O
began O
to O
consider O
whether O
she O
had O
not O
better O
leave O
them O
together O
at O
once. O
 O
But O
as O
she O
wanted O
to O
be O
drawing, O
the O
declaration O
must O
wait O
a O
little O
longer. O
She O
had O
soon O
fixed O
on O
the O
size O
and O
sort O
of O
portrait. O
 O
It O
was O
to O
be O
a O
whole-length O
in O
water-colours, O
like O
Mr. O
John O
Knightley's, O
and O
was O
destined, O
if O
she O
could O
please O
herself, O
to O
hold O
a O
very O
honourable O
station O
over O
the O
mantelpiece. O
The O
sitting O
began; O
and O
Harriet, O
smiling O
and O
blushing, O
and O
afraid O
of O
not O
keeping O
her O
attitude O
and O
countenance, O
presented O
a O
very O
sweet O
mixture O
of O
youthful O
expression O
to O
the O
steady O
eyes O
of O
the O
artist. O
 O
But O
there O
was O
no O
doing O
any O
thing, O
with O
Mr. O
Elton O
fidgeting O
behind O
her O
and O
watching O
every O
touch. O
 O
She O
gave O
him O
credit O
for O
stationing O
himself O
where O
he O
might O
gaze O
and O
gaze O
again O
without O
offence; O
but O
was O
really O
obliged O
to O
put O
an O
end O
to O
it, O
and O
request O
him O
to O
place O
himself O
elsewhere. O
 O
It O
then O
occurred O
to O
her O
to O
employ O
him O
in O
reading. O
"If O
he O
would O
be O
so O
good O
as O
to O
read O
to O
them, O
it O
would O
be O
a O
kindness O
indeed! O
It O
would O
amuse O
away O
the O
difficulties O
of O
her O
part, O
and O
lessen O
the O
irksomeness O
of O
Miss O
Smith's." O
Mr. O
Elton O
was O
only O
too O
happy. O
 O
Harriet O
listened, O
and O
Emma O
drew O
in O
peace. O
 O
She O
must O
allow O
him O
to O
be O
still O
frequently O
coming O
to O
look; O
any O
thing O
less O
would O
certainly O
have O
been O
too O
little O
in O
a O
lover; O
and O
he O
was O
ready O
at O
the O
smallest O
intermission O
of O
the O
pencil, O
to O
jump O
up O
and O
see O
the O
progress, O
and O
be O
charmed.-- O
There O
was O
no O
being O
displeased O
with O
such O
an O
encourager, O
for O
his O
admiration O
made O
him O
discern O
a O
likeness O
almost O
before O
it O
was O
possible. O
 O
She O
could O
not O
respect O
his O
eye, O
but O
his O
love O
and O
his O
complaisance O
were O
unexceptionable. O
The O
sitting O
was O
altogether O
very O
satisfactory; O
she O
was O
quite O
enough O
pleased O
with O
the O
first O
day's O
sketch O
to O
wish O
to O
go O
on. O
 O
There O
was O
no O
want O
of O
likeness, O
she O
had O
been O
fortunate O
in O
the O
attitude, O
and O
as O
she O
meant O
to O
throw O
in O
a O
little O
improvement O
to O
the O
figure, O
to O
give O
a O
little O
more O
height, O
and O
considerably O
more O
elegance, O
she O
had O
great O
confidence O
of O
its O
being O
in O
every O
way O
a O
pretty O
drawing O
at O
last, O
and O
of O
its O
filling O
its O
destined O
place O
with O
credit O
to O
them O
both O
-- O
a O
standing O
memorial O
of O
the O
beauty O
of O
one, O
the O
skill O
of O
the O
other, O
and O
the O
friendship O
of O
both; O
with O
as O
many O
other O
agreeable O
associations O
as O
Mr. O
Elton's O
very O
promising O
attachment O
was O
likely O
to O
add. O
Harriet O
was O
to O
sit O
again O
the O
next O
day; O
and O
Mr. O
Elton, O
just O
as O
he O
ought, O
entreated O
for O
the O
permission O
of O
attending O
and O
reading O
to O
them O
again. O
"By O
all O
means. O
 O
We O
shall O
be O
most O
happy O
to O
consider O
you O
as O
one O
of O
the O
party." O
The O
same O
civilities O
and O
courtesies, O
the O
same O
success O
and O
satisfaction, O
took O
place O
on O
the O
morrow, O
and O
accompanied O
the O
whole O
progress O
of O
the O
picture, O
which O
was O
rapid O
and O
happy. O
 O
Every O
body O
who O
saw O
it O
was O
pleased, O
but O
Mr. O
Elton O
was O
in O
continual O
raptures, O
and O
defended O
it O
through O
every O
criticism. O
"Miss O
Woodhouse O
has O
given O
her O
friend O
the O
only O
beauty O
she O
wanted,"-- O
observed O
Mrs. O
Weston O
to O
him-- O
not O
in O
the O
least O
suspecting O
that O
she O
was O
addressing O
a O
lover.-- O
"The O
expression O
of O
the O
eye O
is O
most O
correct, O
but O
Miss O
Smith O
has O
not O
those O
eyebrows O
and O
eyelashes. O
 O
It O
is O
the O
fault O
of O
her O
face O
that O
she O
has O
them O
not." O
"Do O
you O
think O
so?" O
replied O
he. O
 O
"I O
cannot O
agree O
with O
you. O
 O
It O
appears O
to O
me O
a O
most O
perfect O
resemblance O
in O
every O
feature. O
 O
I O
never O
saw O
such O
a O
likeness O
in O
my O
life. O
 O
We O
must O
allow O
for O
the O
effect O
of O
shade, O
you O
know." O
"You O
have O
made O
her O
too O
tall, O
Emma," O
said O
Mr. O
Knightley. O
Emma O
knew O
that O
she O
had, O
but O
would O
not O
own O
it; O
and O
Mr. O
Elton O
warmly O
added, O
"Oh O
no! O
certainly O
not O
too O
tall; O
not O
in O
the O
least O
too O
tall. O
 O
Consider, O
she O
is O
sitting O
down-- O
which O
naturally O
presents O
a O
different-- O
which O
in O
short O
gives O
exactly O
the O
idea-- O
and O
the O
proportions O
must O
be O
preserved, O
you O
know. O
 O
Proportions, O
fore-shortening.-- O
Oh O
no! O
it O
gives O
one O
exactly O
the O
idea O
of O
such O
a O
height O
as O
Miss O
Smith's. O
Exactly O
so O
indeed!" O
"It O
is O
very O
pretty," O
said O
Mr. O
Woodhouse. O
 O
"So O
prettily O
done! O
Just O
as O
your O
drawings O
always O
are, O
my O
dear. O
 O
I O
do O
not O
know O
any O
body O
who O
draws O
so O
well O
as O
you O
do. O
 O
The O
only O
thing O
I O
do O
not O
thoroughly O
like O
is, O
that O
she O
seems O
to O
be O
sitting O
out O
of O
doors, O
with O
only O
a O
little O
shawl O
over O
her O
shoulders-- O
and O
it O
makes O
one O
think O
she O
must O
catch O
cold." O
"But, O
my O
dear O
papa, O
it O
is O
supposed O
to O
be O
summer; O
a O
warm O
day O
in O
summer. O
Look O
at O
the O
tree." O
"But O
it O
is O
never O
safe O
to O
sit O
out O
of O
doors, O
my O
dear." O
"You, O
sir, O
may O
say O
any O
thing," O
cried O
Mr. O
Elton, O
"but O
I O
must O
confess O
that O
I O
regard O
it O
as O
a O
most O
happy O
thought, O
the O
placing O
of O
Miss O
Smith O
out O
of O
doors; O
and O
the O
tree O
is O
touched O
with O
such O
inimitable O
spirit! O
Any O
other O
situation O
would O
have O
been O
much O
less O
in O
character. O
 O
The O
naivete O
of O
Miss O
Smith's O
manners-- O
and O
altogether-- O
Oh, O
it O
is O
most O
admirable! O
I O
cannot O
keep O
my O
eyes O
from O
it. O
 O
I O
never O
saw O
such O
a O
likeness." O
The O
next O
thing O
wanted O
was O
to O
get O
the O
picture O
framed; O
and O
here O
were O
a O
few O
difficulties. O
 O
It O
must O
be O
done O
directly; O
it O
must O
be O
done O
in O
London; O
the O
order O
must O
go O
through O
the O
hands O
of O
some O
intelligent O
person O
whose O
taste O
could O
be O
depended O
on; O
and O
Isabella, O
the O
usual O
doer O
of O
all O
commissions, O
must O
not O
be O
applied O
to, O
because O
it O
was O
December, O
and O
Mr. O
Woodhouse O
could O
not O
bear O
the O
idea O
of O
her O
stirring O
out O
of O
her O
house O
in O
the O
fogs O
of O
December. O
 O
But O
no O
sooner O
was O
the O
distress O
known O
to O
Mr. O
Elton, O
than O
it O
was O
removed. O
 O
His O
gallantry O
was O
always O
on O
the O
alert. O
"Might O
he O
be O
trusted O
with O
the O
commission, O
what O
infinite O
pleasure O
should O
he O
have O
in O
executing O
it! O
he O
could O
ride O
to O
London O
at O
any O
time. O
 O
It O
was O
impossible O
to O
say O
how O
much O
he O
should O
be O
gratified O
by O
being O
employed O
on O
such O
an O
errand." O
"He O
was O
too O
good!-- O
she O
could O
not O
endure O
the O
thought!-- O
she O
would O
not O
give O
him O
such O
a O
troublesome O
office O
for O
the O
world,"-- O
brought O
on O
the O
desired O
repetition O
of O
entreaties O
and O
assurances,-- O
and O
a O
very O
few O
minutes O
settled O
the O
business. O
Mr. O
Elton O
was O
to O
take O
the O
drawing O
to O
London, O
chuse O
the O
frame, O
and O
give O
the O
directions; O
and O
Emma O
thought O
she O
could O
so O
pack O
it O
as O
to O
ensure O
its O
safety O
without O
much O
incommoding O
him, O
while O
he O
seemed O
mostly O
fearful O
of O
not O
being O
incommoded O
enough. O
"What O
a O
precious O
deposit!" O
said O
he O
with O
a O
tender O
sigh, O
as O
he O
received O
it. O
"This O
man O
is O
almost O
too O
gallant O
to O
be O
in O
love," O
thought O
Emma. O
 O
"I O
should O
say O
so, O
but O
that O
I O
suppose O
there O
may O
be O
a O
hundred O
different O
ways O
of O
being O
in O
love. O
 O
He O
is O
an O
excellent O
young O
man, O
and O
will O
suit O
Harriet O
exactly; O
it O
will O
be O
an O
'Exactly O
so,' O
as O
he O
says O
himself; O
but O
he O
does O
sigh O
and O
languish, O
and O
study O
for O
compliments O
rather O
more O
than O
I O
could O
endure O
as O
a O
principal. O
 O
I O
come O
in O
for O
a O
pretty O
good O
share O
as O
a O
second. O
But O
it O
is O
his O
gratitude O
on O
Harriet's O
account." O
CHAPTER O
VII O
The O
very O
day O
of O
Mr. O
Elton's O
going O
to O
London O
produced O
a O
fresh O
occasion O
for O
Emma's O
services O
towards O
her O
friend. O
 O
Harriet O
had O
been O
at O
Hartfield, O
as O
usual, O
soon O
after O
breakfast; O
and, O
after O
a O
time, O
had O
gone O
home O
to O
return O
again O
to O
dinner: O
she O
returned, O
and O
sooner O
than O
had O
been O
talked O
of, O
and O
with O
an O
agitated, O
hurried O
look, O
announcing O
something O
extraordinary O
to O
have O
happened O
which O
she O
was O
longing O
to O
tell. O
 O
Half O
a O
minute O
brought O
it O
all O
out. O
 O
She O
had O
heard, O
as O
soon O
as O
she O
got O
back O
to O
Mrs. O
Goddard's, O
that O
Mr. O
Martin O
had O
been O
there O
an O
hour O
before, O
and O
finding O
she O
was O
not O
at O
home, O
nor O
particularly O
expected, O
had O
left O
a O
little O
parcel O
for O
her O
from O
one O
of O
his O
sisters, O
and O
gone O
away; O
and O
on O
opening O
this O
parcel, O
she O
had O
actually O
found, O
besides O
the O
two O
songs O
which O
she O
had O
lent O
Elizabeth O
to O
copy, O
a O
letter O
to O
herself; O
and O
this O
letter O
was O
from O
him, O
from O
Mr. O
Martin, O
and O
contained O
a O
direct O
proposal O
of O
marriage. O
 O
"Who O
could O
have O
thought O
it? O
She O
was O
so O
surprized O
she O
did O
not O
know O
what O
to O
do. O
 O
Yes, O
quite O
a O
proposal O
of O
marriage; O
and O
a O
very O
good O
letter, O
at O
least O
she O
thought O
so. O
 O
And O
he O
wrote O
as O
if O
he O
really O
loved O
her O
very O
much-- O
but O
she O
did O
not O
know-- O
and O
so, O
she O
was O
come O
as O
fast O
as O
she O
could O
to O
ask O
Miss O
Woodhouse O
what O
she O
should O
do. O
-- O
" O
Emma O
was O
half-ashamed O
of O
her O
friend O
for O
seeming O
so O
pleased O
and O
so O
doubtful. O
"Upon O
my O
word," O
she O
cried, O
"the O
young O
man O
is O
determined O
not O
to O
lose O
any O
thing O
for O
want O
of O
asking. O
 O
He O
will O
connect O
himself O
well O
if O
he O
can." O
"Will O
you O
read O
the O
letter?" O
cried O
Harriet. O
 O
"Pray O
do. O
 O
I'd O
rather O
you O
would." O
Emma O
was O
not O
sorry O
to O
be O
pressed. O
 O
She O
read, O
and O
was O
surprized. O
 O
The O
style O
of O
the O
letter O
was O
much O
above O
her O
expectation. O
 O
There O
were O
not O
merely O
no O
grammatical O
errors, O
but O
as O
a O
composition O
it O
would O
not O
have O
disgraced O
a O
gentleman; O
the O
language, O
though O
plain, O
was O
strong O
and O
unaffected, O
and O
the O
sentiments O
it O
conveyed O
very O
much O
to O
the O
credit O
of O
the O
writer. O
 O
It O
was O
short, O
but O
expressed O
good O
sense, O
warm O
attachment, O
liberality, O
propriety, O
even O
delicacy O
of O
feeling. O
 O
She O
paused O
over O
it, O
while O
Harriet O
stood O
anxiously O
watching O
for O
her O
opinion, O
with O
a O
"Well, O
well," O
and O
was O
at O
last O
forced O
to O
add, O
"Is O
it O
a O
good O
letter? O
or O
is O
it O
too O
short?" O
"Yes, O
indeed, O
a O
very O
good O
letter," O
replied O
Emma O
rather O
slowly-- O
"so O
good O
a O
letter, O
Harriet, O
that O
every O
thing O
considered, O
I O
think O
one O
of O
his O
sisters O
must O
have O
helped O
him. O
 O
I O
can O
hardly O
imagine O
the O
young O
man O
whom O
I O
saw O
talking O
with O
you O
the O
other O
day O
could O
express O
himself O
so O
well, O
if O
left O
quite O
to O
his O
own O
powers, O
and O
yet O
it O
is O
not O
the O
style O
of O
a O
woman; O
no, O
certainly, O
it O
is O
too O
strong O
and O
concise; O
not O
diffuse O
enough O
for O
a O
woman. O
 O
No O
doubt O
he O
is O
a O
sensible O
man, O
and O
I O
suppose O
may O
have O
a O
natural O
talent O
for-- O
thinks O
strongly O
and O
clearly-- O
and O
when O
he O
takes O
a O
pen O
in O
hand, O
his O
thoughts O
naturally O
find O
proper O
words. O
 O
It O
is O
so O
with O
some O
men. O
 O
Yes, O
I O
understand O
the O
sort O
of O
mind. O
 O
Vigorous, O
decided, O
with O
sentiments O
to O
a O
certain O
point, O
not O
coarse. O
 O
A O
better O
written O
letter, O
Harriet O
(returning O
it,) O
than O
I O
had O
expected." O
"Well," O
said O
the O
still O
waiting O
Harriet;-- O
"well-- O
and-- O
and O
what O
shall O
I O
do?" O
"What O
shall O
you O
do! O
In O
what O
respect? O
Do O
you O
mean O
with O
regard O
to O
this O
letter?" O
"Yes." O
"But O
what O
are O
you O
in O
doubt O
of? O
You O
must O
answer O
it O
of O
course-- O
and O
speedily." O
"Yes. O
But O
what O
shall O
I O
say? O
Dear O
Miss O
Woodhouse, O
do O
advise O
me." O
"Oh O
no, O
no! O
the O
letter O
had O
much O
better O
be O
all O
your O
own. O
 O
You O
will O
express O
yourself O
very O
properly, O
I O
am O
sure. O
 O
There O
is O
no O
danger O
of O
your O
not O
being O
intelligible, O
which O
is O
the O
first O
thing. O
 O
Your O
meaning O
must O
be O
unequivocal; O
no O
doubts O
or O
demurs: O
and O
such O
expressions O
of O
gratitude O
and O
concern O
for O
the O
pain O
you O
are O
inflicting O
as O
propriety O
requires, O
will O
present O
themselves O
unbidden O
to O
your O
mind, O
I O
am O
persuaded. O
 O
You O
need O
not O
be O
prompted O
to O
write O
with O
the O
appearance O
of O
sorrow O
for O
his O
disappointment." O
"You O
think O
I O
ought O
to O
refuse O
him O
then," O
said O
Harriet, O
looking O
down. O
"Ought O
to O
refuse O
him! O
My O
dear O
Harriet, O
what O
do O
you O
mean? O
Are O
you O
in O
any O
doubt O
as O
to O
that? O
I O
thought-- O
but O
I O
beg O
your O
pardon, O
perhaps O
I O
have O
been O
under O
a O
mistake. O
 O
I O
certainly O
have O
been O
misunderstanding O
you, O
if O
you O
feel O
in O
doubt O
as O
to O
the O
purport O
of O
your O
answer. O
 O
I O
had O
imagined O
you O
were O
consulting O
me O
only O
as O
to O
the O
wording O
of O
it." O
Harriet O
was O
silent. O
 O
With O
a O
little O
reserve O
of O
manner, O
Emma O
continued: O
"You O
mean O
to O
return O
a O
favourable O
answer, O
I O
collect." O
"No, O
I O
do O
not; O
that O
is, O
I O
do O
not O
mean-- O
What O
shall O
I O
do? O
What O
would O
you O
advise O
me O
to O
do? O
Pray, O
dear O
Miss O
Woodhouse, O
tell O
me O
what O
I O
ought O
to O
do." O
"I O
shall O
not O
give O
you O
any O
advice, O
Harriet. O
 O
I O
will O
have O
nothing O
to O
do O
with O
it. O
 O
This O
is O
a O
point O
which O
you O
must O
settle O
with O
your O
feelings." O
"I O
had O
no O
notion O
that O
he O
liked O
me O
so O
very O
much," O
said O
Harriet, O
contemplating O
the O
letter. O
 O
For O
a O
little O
while O
Emma O
persevered O
in O
her O
silence; O
but O
beginning O
to O
apprehend O
the O
bewitching O
flattery O
of O
that O
letter O
might O
be O
too O
powerful, O
she O
thought O
it O
best O
to O
say, O
"I O
lay O
it O
down O
as O
a O
general O
rule, O
Harriet, O
that O
if O
a O
woman O
doubts O
as O
to O
whether O
she O
should O
accept O
a O
man O
or O
not, O
she O
certainly O
ought O
to O
refuse O
him. O
 O
If O
she O
can O
hesitate O
as O
to O
'Yes,' O
she O
ought O
to O
say O
'No' O
directly. O
 O
It O
is O
not O
a O
state O
to O
be O
safely O
entered O
into O
with O
doubtful O
feelings, O
with O
half O
a O
heart. O
 O
I O
thought O
it O
my O
duty O
as O
a O
friend, O
and O
older O
than O
yourself, O
to O
say O
thus O
much O
to O
you. O
 O
But O
do O
not O
imagine O
that O
I O
want O
to O
influence O
you." O
"Oh! O
no, O
I O
am O
sure O
you O
are O
a O
great O
deal O
too O
kind O
to-- O
but O
if O
you O
would O
just O
advise O
me O
what O
I O
had O
best O
do-- O
No, O
no, O
I O
do O
not O
mean O
that-- O
As O
you O
say, O
one's O
mind O
ought O
to O
be O
quite O
made O
up-- O
One O
should O
not O
be O
hesitating-- O
It O
is O
a O
very O
serious O
thing.-- O
It O
will O
be O
safer O
to O
say O
'No,' O
perhaps.-- O
Do O
you O
think O
I O
had O
better O
say O
'No?'" O
"Not O
for O
the O
world," O
said O
Emma, O
smiling O
graciously, O
"would O
I O
advise O
you O
either O
way. O
 O
You O
must O
be O
the O
best O
judge O
of O
your O
own O
happiness. O
 O
If O
you O
prefer O
Mr. O
Martin O
to O
every O
other O
person; O
if O
you O
think O
him O
the O
most O
agreeable O
man O
you O
have O
ever O
been O
in O
company O
with, O
why O
should O
you O
hesitate? O
You O
blush, O
Harriet.-- O
Does O
any O
body O
else O
occur O
to O
you O
at O
this O
moment O
under O
such O
a O
definition? O
Harriet, O
Harriet, O
do O
not O
deceive O
yourself; O
do O
not O
be O
run O
away O
with O
by O
gratitude O
and O
compassion. O
 O
At O
this O
moment O
whom O
are O
you O
thinking O
of?" O
The O
symptoms O
were O
favourable.-- O
Instead O
of O
answering, O
Harriet O
turned O
away O
confused, O
and O
stood O
thoughtfully O
by O
the O
fire; O
and O
though O
the O
letter O
was O
still O
in O
her O
hand, O
it O
was O
now O
mechanically O
twisted O
about O
without O
regard. O
 O
Emma O
waited O
the O
result O
with O
impatience, O
but O
not O
without O
strong O
hopes. O
 O
At O
last, O
with O
some O
hesitation, O
Harriet O
said-- O
"Miss O
Woodhouse, O
as O
you O
will O
not O
give O
me O
your O
opinion, O
I O
must O
do O
as O
well O
as O
I O
can O
by O
myself; O
and O
I O
have O
now O
quite O
determined, O
and O
really O
almost O
made O
up O
my O
mind-- O
to O
refuse O
Mr. O
Martin. O
 O
Do O
you O
think O
I O
am O
right?" O
"Perfectly, O
perfectly O
right, O
my O
dearest O
Harriet; O
you O
are O
doing O
just O
what O
you O
ought. O
 O
While O
you O
were O
at O
all O
in O
suspense O
I O
kept O
my O
feelings O
to O
myself, O
but O
now O
that O
you O
are O
so O
completely O
decided O
I O
have O
no O
hesitation O
in O
approving. O
 O
Dear O
Harriet, O
I O
give O
myself O
joy O
of O
this. O
 O
It O
would O
have O
grieved O
me O
to O
lose O
your O
acquaintance, O
which O
must O
have O
been O
the O
consequence O
of O
your O
marrying O
Mr. O
Martin. O
 O
While O
you O
were O
in O
the O
smallest O
degree O
wavering, O
I O
said O
nothing O
about O
it, O
because O
I O
would O
not O
influence; O
but O
it O
would O
have O
been O
the O
loss O
of O
a O
friend O
to O
me. O
 O
I O
could O
not O
have O
visited O
Mrs. O
Robert O
Martin, O
of O
Abbey-Mill O
Farm. O
 O
Now O
I O
am O
secure O
of O
you O
for O
ever." O
Harriet O
had O
not O
surmised O
her O
own O
danger, O
but O
the O
idea O
of O
it O
struck O
her O
forcibly. O
"You O
could O
not O
have O
visited O
me!" O
she O
cried, O
looking O
aghast. O
 O
"No, O
to O
be O
sure O
you O
could O
not; O
but O
I O
never O
thought O
of O
that O
before. O
 O
That O
would O
have O
been O
too O
dreadful!-- O
What O
an O
escape!-- O
Dear O
Miss O
Woodhouse, O
I O
would O
not O
give O
up O
the O
pleasure O
and O
honour O
of O
being O
intimate O
with O
you O
for O
any O
thing O
in O
the O
world." O
"Indeed, O
Harriet, O
it O
would O
have O
been O
a O
severe O
pang O
to O
lose O
you; O
but O
it O
must O
have O
been. O
 O
You O
would O
have O
thrown O
yourself O
out O
of O
all O
good O
society. O
 O
I O
must O
have O
given O
you O
up." O
"Dear O
me!-- O
How O
should O
I O
ever O
have O
borne O
it! O
It O
would O
have O
killed O
me O
never O
to O
come O
to O
Hartfield O
any O
more!" O
"Dear O
affectionate O
creature!-- O
You O
banished O
to O
Abbey-Mill O
Farm!-- O
You O
confined O
to O
the O
society O
of O
the O
illiterate O
and O
vulgar O
all O
your O
life! O
 O
I O
wonder O
how O
the O
young O
man O
could O
have O
the O
assurance O
to O
ask O
it. O
 O
He O
must O
have O
a O
pretty O
good O
opinion O
of O
himself." O
"I O
do O
not O
think O
he O
is O
conceited O
either, O
in O
general," O
said O
Harriet, O
her O
conscience O
opposing O
such O
censure; O
"at O
least, O
he O
is O
very O
good O
natured, O
and O
I O
shall O
always O
feel O
much O
obliged O
to O
him, O
and O
have O
a O
great O
regard O
for-- O
but O
that O
is O
quite O
a O
different O
thing O
from-- O
and O
you O
know, O
though O
he O
may O
like O
me, O
it O
does O
not O
follow O
that O
I O
should-- O
and O
certainly O
I O
must O
confess O
that O
since O
my O
visiting O
here O
I O
have O
seen O
people-- O
and O
if O
one O
comes O
to O
compare O
them, O
person O
and O
manners, O
there O
is O
no O
comparison O
at O
all, O
one O
is O
so O
very O
handsome O
and O
agreeable. O
 O
However, O
I O
do O
really O
think O
Mr. O
Martin O
a O
very O
amiable O
young O
man, O
and O
have O
a O
great O
opinion O
of O
him; O
and O
his O
being O
so O
much O
attached O
to O
me-- O
and O
his O
writing O
such O
a O
letter-- O
but O
as O
to O
leaving O
you, O
it O
is O
what O
I O
would O
not O
do O
upon O
any O
consideration." O
"Thank O
you, O
thank O
you, O
my O
own O
sweet O
little O
friend. O
 O
We O
will O
not O
be O
parted. O
 O
A O
woman O
is O
not O
to O
marry O
a O
man O
merely O
because O
she O
is O
asked, O
or O
because O
he O
is O
attached O
to O
her, O
and O
can O
write O
a O
tolerable O
letter." O
"Oh O
no;-- O
and O
it O
is O
but O
a O
short O
letter O
too." O
Emma O
felt O
the O
bad O
taste O
of O
her O
friend, O
but O
let O
it O
pass O
with O
a O
"very O
true; O
and O
it O
would O
be O
a O
small O
consolation O
to O
her, O
for O
the O
clownish O
manner O
which O
might O
be O
offending O
her O
every O
hour O
of O
the O
day, O
to O
know O
that O
her O
husband O
could O
write O
a O
good O
letter." O
"Oh! O
yes, O
very. O
 O
Nobody O
cares O
for O
a O
letter; O
the O
thing O
is, O
to O
be O
always O
happy O
with O
pleasant O
companions. O
 O
I O
am O
quite O
determined O
to O
refuse O
him. O
But O
how O
shall O
I O
do? O
What O
shall O
I O
say?" O
Emma O
assured O
her O
there O
would O
be O
no O
difficulty O
in O
the O
answer, O
and O
advised O
its O
being O
written O
directly, O
which O
was O
agreed O
to, O
in O
the O
hope O
of O
her O
assistance; O
and O
though O
Emma O
continued O
to O
protest O
against O
any O
assistance O
being O
wanted, O
it O
was O
in O
fact O
given O
in O
the O
formation O
of O
every O
sentence. O
 O
The O
looking O
over O
his O
letter O
again, O
in O
replying O
to O
it, O
had O
such O
a O
softening O
tendency, O
that O
it O
was O
particularly O
necessary O
to O
brace O
her O
up O
with O
a O
few O
decisive O
expressions; O
and O
she O
was O
so O
very O
much O
concerned O
at O
the O
idea O
of O
making O
him O
unhappy, O
and O
thought O
so O
much O
of O
what O
his O
mother O
and O
sisters O
would O
think O
and O
say, O
and O
was O
so O
anxious O
that O
they O
should O
not O
fancy O
her O
ungrateful, O
that O
Emma O
believed O
if O
the O
young O
man O
had O
come O
in O
her O
way O
at O
that O
moment, O
he O
would O
have O
been O
accepted O
after O
all. O
This O
letter, O
however, O
was O
written, O
and O
sealed, O
and O
sent. O
 O
The O
business O
was O
finished, O
and O
Harriet O
safe. O
 O
She O
was O
rather O
low O
all O
the O
evening, O
but O
Emma O
could O
allow O
for O
her O
amiable O
regrets, O
and O
sometimes O
relieved O
them O
by O
speaking O
of O
her O
own O
affection, O
sometimes O
by O
bringing O
forward O
the O
idea O
of O
Mr. O
Elton. O
"I O
shall O
never O
be O
invited O
to O
Abbey-Mill O
again," O
was O
said O
in O
rather O
a O
sorrowful O
tone. O
"Nor, O
if O
you O
were, O
could O
I O
ever O
bear O
to O
part O
with O
you, O
my O
Harriet. O
 O
You O
are O
a O
great O
deal O
too O
necessary O
at O
Hartfield O
to O
be O
spared O
to O
Abbey-Mill." O
"And O
I O
am O
sure O
I O
should O
never O
want O
to O
go O
there; O
for O
I O
am O
never O
happy O
but O
at O
Hartfield." O
Some O
time O
afterwards O
it O
was, O
"I O
think O
Mrs. O
Goddard O
would O
be O
very O
much O
surprized O
if O
she O
knew O
what O
had O
happened. O
 O
I O
am O
sure O
Miss O
Nash O
would-- O
for O
Miss O
Nash O
thinks O
her O
own O
sister O
very O
well O
married, O
and O
it O
is O
only O
a O
linen-draper." O
"One O
should O
be O
sorry O
to O
see O
greater O
pride O
or O
refinement O
in O
the O
teacher O
of O
a O
school, O
Harriet. O
 O
I O
dare O
say O
Miss O
Nash O
would O
envy O
you O
such O
an O
opportunity O
as O
this O
of O
being O
married. O
 O
Even O
this O
conquest O
would O
appear O
valuable O
in O
her O
eyes. O
 O
As O
to O
any O
thing O
superior O
for O
you, O
I O
suppose O
she O
is O
quite O
in O
the O
dark. O
 O
The O
attentions O
of O
a O
certain O
person O
can O
hardly O
be O
among O
the O
tittle-tattle O
of O
Highbury O
yet. O
 O
Hitherto O
I O
fancy O
you O
and O
I O
are O
the O
only O
people O
to O
whom O
his O
looks O
and O
manners O
have O
explained O
themselves." O
Harriet O
blushed O
and O
smiled, O
and O
said O
something O
about O
wondering O
that O
people O
should O
like O
her O
so O
much. O
 O
The O
idea O
of O
Mr. O
Elton O
was O
certainly O
cheering; O
but O
still, O
after O
a O
time, O
she O
was O
tender-hearted O
again O
towards O
the O
rejected O
Mr. O
Martin. O
"Now O
he O
has O
got O
my O
letter," O
said O
she O
softly. O
 O
"I O
wonder O
what O
they O
are O
all O
doing-- O
whether O
his O
sisters O
know-- O
if O
he O
is O
unhappy, O
they O
will O
be O
unhappy O
too. O
 O
I O
hope O
he O
will O
not O
mind O
it O
so O
very O
much." O
"Let O
us O
think O
of O
those O
among O
our O
absent O
friends O
who O
are O
more O
cheerfully O
employed," O
cried O
Emma. O
 O
"At O
this O
moment, O
perhaps, O
Mr. O
Elton O
is O
shewing O
your O
picture O
to O
his O
mother O
and O
sisters, O
telling O
how O
much O
more O
beautiful O
is O
the O
original, O
and O
after O
being O
asked O
for O
it O
five O
or O
six O
times, O
allowing O
them O
to O
hear O
your O
name, O
your O
own O
dear O
name." O
"My O
picture!-- O
But O
he O
has O
left O
my O
picture O
in O
Bond-street." O
"Has O
he O
so!-- O
Then O
I O
know O
nothing O
of O
Mr. O
Elton. O
 O
No, O
my O
dear O
little O
modest O
Harriet, O
depend O
upon O
it O
the O
picture O
will O
not O
be O
in O
Bond-street O
till O
just O
before O
he O
mounts O
his O
horse O
to-morrow. O
 O
It O
is O
his O
companion O
all O
this O
evening, O
his O
solace, O
his O
delight. O
 O
It O
opens O
his O
designs O
to O
his O
family, O
it O
introduces O
you O
among O
them, O
it O
diffuses O
through O
the O
party O
those O
pleasantest O
feelings O
of O
our O
nature, O
eager O
curiosity O
and O
warm O
prepossession. O
 O
How O
cheerful, O
how O
animated, O
how O
suspicious, O
how O
busy O
their O
imaginations O
all O
are!" O
Harriet O
smiled O
again, O
and O
her O
smiles O
grew O
stronger. O
CHAPTER O
VIII O
Harriet O
slept O
at O
Hartfield O
that O
night. O
 O
For O
some O
weeks O
past O
she O
had O
been O
spending O
more O
than O
half O
her O
time O
there, O
and O
gradually O
getting O
to O
have O
a O
bed-room O
appropriated O
to O
herself; O
and O
Emma O
judged O
it O
best O
in O
every O
respect, O
safest O
and O
kindest, O
to O
keep O
her O
with O
them O
as O
much O
as O
possible O
just O
at O
present. O
 O
She O
was O
obliged O
to O
go O
the O
next O
morning O
for O
an O
hour O
or O
two O
to O
Mrs. O
Goddard's, O
but O
it O
was O
then O
to O
be O
settled O
that O
she O
should O
return O
to O
Hartfield, O
to O
make O
a O
regular O
visit O
of O
some O
days. O
While O
she O
was O
gone, O
Mr. O
Knightley O
called, O
and O
sat O
some O
time O
with O
Mr. O
Woodhouse O
and O
Emma, O
till O
Mr. O
Woodhouse, O
who O
had O
previously O
made O
up O
his O
mind O
to O
walk O
out, O
was O
persuaded O
by O
his O
daughter O
not O
to O
defer O
it, O
and O
was O
induced O
by O
the O
entreaties O
of O
both, O
though O
against O
the O
scruples O
of O
his O
own O
civility, O
to O
leave O
Mr. O
Knightley O
for O
that O
purpose. O
 O
Mr. O
Knightley, O
who O
had O
nothing O
of O
ceremony O
about O
him, O
was O
offering O
by O
his O
short, O
decided O
answers, O
an O
amusing O
contrast O
to O
the O
protracted O
apologies O
and O
civil O
hesitations O
of O
the O
other. O
"Well, O
I O
believe, O
if O
you O
will O
excuse O
me, O
Mr. O
Knightley, O
if O
you O
will O
not O
consider O
me O
as O
doing O
a O
very O
rude O
thing, O
I O
shall O
take O
Emma's O
advice O
and O
go O
out O
for O
a O
quarter O
of O
an O
hour. O
 O
As O
the O
sun O
is O
out, O
I O
believe O
I O
had O
better O
take O
my O
three O
turns O
while O
I O
can. O
 O
I O
treat O
you O
without O
ceremony, O
Mr. O
Knightley. O
 O
We O
invalids O
think O
we O
are O
privileged O
people." O
"My O
dear O
sir, O
do O
not O
make O
a O
stranger O
of O
me." O
"I O
leave O
an O
excellent O
substitute O
in O
my O
daughter. O
 O
Emma O
will O
be O
happy O
to O
entertain O
you. O
 O
And O
therefore O
I O
think O
I O
will O
beg O
your O
excuse O
and O
take O
my O
three O
turns-- O
my O
winter O
walk." O
"You O
cannot O
do O
better, O
sir." O
"I O
would O
ask O
for O
the O
pleasure O
of O
your O
company, O
Mr. O
Knightley, O
but O
I O
am O
a O
very O
slow O
walker, O
and O
my O
pace O
would O
be O
tedious O
to O
you; O
and, O
besides, O
you O
have O
another O
long O
walk O
before O
you, O
to O
Donwell O
Abbey." O
"Thank O
you, O
sir, O
thank O
you; O
I O
am O
going O
this O
moment O
myself; O
and O
I O
think O
the O
sooner O
you O
go O
the O
better. O
 O
I O
will O
fetch O
your O
greatcoat O
and O
open O
the O
garden O
door O
for O
you." O
Mr. O
Woodhouse O
at O
last O
was O
off; O
but O
Mr. O
Knightley, O
instead O
of O
being O
immediately O
off O
likewise, O
sat O
down O
again, O
seemingly O
inclined O
for O
more O
chat. O
 O
He O
began O
speaking O
of O
Harriet, O
and O
speaking O
of O
her O
with O
more O
voluntary O
praise O
than O
Emma O
had O
ever O
heard O
before. O
"I O
cannot O
rate O
her O
beauty O
as O
you O
do," O
said O
he; O
"but O
she O
is O
a O
pretty O
little O
creature, O
and O
I O
am O
inclined O
to O
think O
very O
well O
of O
her O
disposition. O
 O
Her O
character O
depends O
upon O
those O
she O
is O
with; O
but O
in O
good O
hands O
she O
will O
turn O
out O
a O
valuable O
woman." O
"I O
am O
glad O
you O
think O
so; O
and O
the O
good O
hands, O
I O
hope, O
may O
not O
be O
wanting." O
"Come," O
said O
he, O
"you O
are O
anxious O
for O
a O
compliment, O
so O
I O
will O
tell O
you O
that O
you O
have O
improved O
her. O
 O
You O
have O
cured O
her O
of O
her O
school-girl's O
giggle; O
she O
really O
does O
you O
credit." O
"Thank O
you. O
 O
I O
should O
be O
mortified O
indeed O
if O
I O
did O
not O
believe O
I O
had O
been O
of O
some O
use; O
but O
it O
is O
not O
every O
body O
who O
will O
bestow O
praise O
where O
they O
may. O
 O
You O
do O
not O
often O
overpower O
me O
with O
it." O
"You O
are O
expecting O
her O
again, O
you O
say, O
this O
morning?" O
"Almost O
every O
moment. O
 O
She O
has O
been O
gone O
longer O
already O
than O
she O
intended." O
"Something O
has O
happened O
to O
delay O
her; O
some O
visitors O
perhaps." O
"Highbury O
gossips!-- O
Tiresome O
wretches!" O
"Harriet O
may O
not O
consider O
every O
body O
tiresome O
that O
you O
would." O
Emma O
knew O
this O
was O
too O
true O
for O
contradiction, O
and O
therefore O
said O
nothing. O
 O
He O
presently O
added, O
with O
a O
smile, O
"I O
do O
not O
pretend O
to O
fix O
on O
times O
or O
places, O
but O
I O
must O
tell O
you O
that O
I O
have O
good O
reason O
to O
believe O
your O
little O
friend O
will O
soon O
hear O
of O
something O
to O
her O
advantage." O
"Indeed! O
how O
so? O
of O
what O
sort?" O
"A O
very O
serious O
sort, O
I O
assure O
you;" O
still O
smiling. O
"Very O
serious! O
I O
can O
think O
of O
but O
one O
thing-- O
Who O
is O
in O
love O
with O
her? O
Who O
makes O
you O
their O
confidant?" O
Emma O
was O
more O
than O
half O
in O
hopes O
of O
Mr. O
Elton's O
having O
dropt O
a O
hint. O
Mr. O
Knightley O
was O
a O
sort O
of O
general O
friend O
and O
adviser, O
and O
she O
knew O
Mr. O
Elton O
looked O
up O
to O
him. O
"I O
have O
reason O
to O
think," O
he O
replied, O
"that O
Harriet O
Smith O
will O
soon O
have O
an O
offer O
of O
marriage, O
and O
from O
a O
most O
unexceptionable O
quarter:-- O
Robert O
Martin O
is O
the O
man. O
 O
Her O
visit O
to O
Abbey-Mill, O
this O
summer, O
seems O
to O
have O
done O
his O
business. O
 O
He O
is O
desperately O
in O
love O
and O
means O
to O
marry O
her." O
"He O
is O
very O
obliging," O
said O
Emma; O
"but O
is O
he O
sure O
that O
Harriet O
means O
to O
marry O
him?" O
"Well, O
well, O
means O
to O
make O
her O
an O
offer O
then. O
 O
Will O
that O
do? O
He O
came O
to O
the O
Abbey O
two O
evenings O
ago, O
on O
purpose O
to O
consult O
me O
about O
it. O
 O
He O
knows O
I O
have O
a O
thorough O
regard O
for O
him O
and O
all O
his O
family, O
and, O
I O
believe, O
considers O
me O
as O
one O
of O
his O
best O
friends. O
 O
He O
came O
to O
ask O
me O
whether O
I O
thought O
it O
would O
be O
imprudent O
in O
him O
to O
settle O
so O
early; O
whether O
I O
thought O
her O
too O
young: O
in O
short, O
whether O
I O
approved O
his O
choice O
altogether; O
having O
some O
apprehension O
perhaps O
of O
her O
being O
considered O
(especially O
since O
your O
making O
so O
much O
of O
her) O
as O
in O
a O
line O
of O
society O
above O
him. O
 O
I O
was O
very O
much O
pleased O
with O
all O
that O
he O
said. O
I O
never O
hear O
better O
sense O
from O
any O
one O
than O
Robert O
Martin. O
 O
He O
always O
speaks O
to O
the O
purpose; O
open, O
straightforward, O
and O
very O
well O
judging. O
He O
told O
me O
every O
thing; O
his O
circumstances O
and O
plans, O
and O
what O
they O
all O
proposed O
doing O
in O
the O
event O
of O
his O
marriage. O
 O
He O
is O
an O
excellent O
young O
man, O
both O
as O
son O
and O
brother. O
 O
I O
had O
no O
hesitation O
in O
advising O
him O
to O
marry. O
 O
He O
proved O
to O
me O
that O
he O
could O
afford O
it; O
and O
that O
being O
the O
case, O
I O
was O
convinced O
he O
could O
not O
do O
better. O
 O
I O
praised O
the O
fair O
lady O
too, O
and O
altogether O
sent O
him O
away O
very O
happy. O
 O
If O
he O
had O
never O
esteemed O
my O
opinion O
before, O
he O
would O
have O
thought O
highly O
of O
me O
then; O
and, O
I O
dare O
say, O
left O
the O
house O
thinking O
me O
the O
best O
friend O
and O
counsellor O
man O
ever O
had. O
 O
This O
happened O
the O
night O
before O
last. O
 O
Now, O
as O
we O
may O
fairly O
suppose, O
he O
would O
not O
allow O
much O
time O
to O
pass O
before O
he O
spoke O
to O
the O
lady, O
and O
as O
he O
does O
not O
appear O
to O
have O
spoken O
yesterday, O
it O
is O
not O
unlikely O
that O
he O
should O
be O
at O
Mrs. O
Goddard's O
to-day; O
and O
she O
may O
be O
detained O
by O
a O
visitor, O
without O
thinking O
him O
at O
all O
a O
tiresome O
wretch." O
"Pray, O
Mr. O
Knightley," O
said O
Emma, O
who O
had O
been O
smiling O
to O
herself O
through O
a O
great O
part O
of O
this O
speech, O
"how O
do O
you O
know O
that O
Mr. O
Martin O
did O
not O
speak O
yesterday?" O
"Certainly," O
replied O
he, O
surprized, O
"I O
do O
not O
absolutely O
know O
it; O
but O
it O
may O
be O
inferred. O
 O
Was O
not O
she O
the O
whole O
day O
with O
you?" O
"Come," O
said O
she, O
"I O
will O
tell O
you O
something, O
in O
return O
for O
what O
you O
have O
told O
me. O
 O
He O
did O
speak O
yesterday-- O
that O
is, O
he O
wrote, O
and O
was O
refused." O
This O
was O
obliged O
to O
be O
repeated O
before O
it O
could O
be O
believed; O
and O
Mr. O
Knightley O
actually O
looked O
red O
with O
surprize O
and O
displeasure, O
as O
he O
stood O
up, O
in O
tall O
indignation, O
and O
said, O
"Then O
she O
is O
a O
greater O
simpleton O
than O
I O
ever O
believed O
her. O
 O
What O
is O
the O
foolish O
girl O
about?" O
"Oh! O
to O
be O
sure," O
cried O
Emma, O
"it O
is O
always O
incomprehensible O
to O
a O
man O
that O
a O
woman O
should O
ever O
refuse O
an O
offer O
of O
marriage. O
 O
A O
man O
always O
imagines O
a O
woman O
to O
be O
ready O
for O
any O
body O
who O
asks O
her." O
"Nonsense! O
a O
man O
does O
not O
imagine O
any O
such O
thing. O
 O
But O
what O
is O
the O
meaning O
of O
this? O
Harriet O
Smith O
refuse O
Robert O
Martin? O
madness, O
if O
it O
is O
so; O
but O
I O
hope O
you O
are O
mistaken." O
"I O
saw O
her O
answer!-- O
nothing O
could O
be O
clearer." O
"You O
saw O
her O
answer!-- O
you O
wrote O
her O
answer O
too. O
 O
Emma, O
this O
is O
your O
doing. O
 O
You O
persuaded O
her O
to O
refuse O
him." O
"And O
if O
I O
did, O
(which, O
however, O
I O
am O
far O
from O
allowing) O
I O
should O
not O
feel O
that O
I O
had O
done O
wrong. O
 O
Mr. O
Martin O
is O
a O
very O
respectable O
young O
man, O
but O
I O
cannot O
admit O
him O
to O
be O
Harriet's O
equal; O
and O
am O
rather O
surprized O
indeed O
that O
he O
should O
have O
ventured O
to O
address O
her. O
 O
By O
your O
account, O
he O
does O
seem O
to O
have O
had O
some O
scruples. O
 O
It O
is O
a O
pity O
that O
they O
were O
ever O
got O
over." O
"Not O
Harriet's O
equal!" O
exclaimed O
Mr. O
Knightley O
loudly O
and O
warmly; O
and O
with O
calmer O
asperity, O
added, O
a O
few O
moments O
afterwards, O
"No, O
he O
is O
not O
her O
equal O
indeed, O
for O
he O
is O
as O
much O
her O
superior O
in O
sense O
as O
in O
situation. O
 O
Emma, O
your O
infatuation O
about O
that O
girl O
blinds O
you. O
 O
What O
are O
Harriet O
Smith's O
claims, O
either O
of O
birth, O
nature O
or O
education, O
to O
any O
connexion O
higher O
than O
Robert O
Martin? O
She O
is O
the O
natural O
daughter O
of O
nobody O
knows O
whom, O
with O
probably O
no O
settled O
provision O
at O
all, O
and O
certainly O
no O
respectable O
relations. O
 O
She O
is O
known O
only O
as O
parlour-boarder O
at O
a O
common O
school. O
 O
She O
is O
not O
a O
sensible O
girl, O
nor O
a O
girl O
of O
any O
information. O
 O
She O
has O
been O
taught O
nothing O
useful, O
and O
is O
too O
young O
and O
too O
simple O
to O
have O
acquired O
any O
thing O
herself. O
 O
At O
her O
age O
she O
can O
have O
no O
experience, O
and O
with O
her O
little O
wit, O
is O
not O
very O
likely O
ever O
to O
have O
any O
that O
can O
avail O
her. O
 O
She O
is O
pretty, O
and O
she O
is O
good O
tempered, O
and O
that O
is O
all. O
 O
My O
only O
scruple O
in O
advising O
the O
match O
was O
on O
his O
account, O
as O
being O
beneath O
his O
deserts, O
and O
a O
bad O
connexion O
for O
him. O
 O
I O
felt O
that, O
as O
to O
fortune, O
in O
all O
probability O
he O
might O
do O
much O
better; O
and O
that O
as O
to O
a O
rational O
companion O
or O
useful O
helpmate, O
he O
could O
not O
do O
worse. O
 O
But O
I O
could O
not O
reason O
so O
to O
a O
man O
in O
love, O
and O
was O
willing O
to O
trust O
to O
there O
being O
no O
harm O
in O
her, O
to O
her O
having O
that O
sort O
of O
disposition, O
which, O
in O
good O
hands, O
like O
his, O
might O
be O
easily O
led O
aright O
and O
turn O
out O
very O
well. O
 O
The O
advantage O
of O
the O
match O
I O
felt O
to O
be O
all O
on O
her O
side; O
and O
had O
not O
the O
smallest O
doubt O
(nor O
have O
I O
now) O
that O
there O
would O
be O
a O
general O
cry-out O
upon O
her O
extreme O
good O
luck. O
 O
Even O
your O
satisfaction O
I O
made O
sure O
of. O
 O
It O
crossed O
my O
mind O
immediately O
that O
you O
would O
not O
regret O
your O
friend's O
leaving O
Highbury, O
for O
the O
sake O
of O
her O
being O
settled O
so O
well. O
 O
I O
remember O
saying O
to O
myself, O
'Even O
Emma, O
with O
all O
her O
partiality O
for O
Harriet, O
will O
think O
this O
a O
good O
match.'" O
"I O
cannot O
help O
wondering O
at O
your O
knowing O
so O
little O
of O
Emma O
as O
to O
say O
any O
such O
thing. O
 O
What! O
think O
a O
farmer, O
(and O
with O
all O
his O
sense O
and O
all O
his O
merit O
Mr. O
Martin O
is O
nothing O
more,) O
a O
good O
match O
for O
my O
intimate O
friend! O
Not O
regret O
her O
leaving O
Highbury O
for O
the O
sake O
of O
marrying O
a O
man O
whom O
I O
could O
never O
admit O
as O
an O
acquaintance O
of O
my O
own! O
I O
wonder O
you O
should O
think O
it O
possible O
for O
me O
to O
have O
such O
feelings. O
 O
I O
assure O
you O
mine O
are O
very O
different. O
 O
I O
must O
think O
your O
statement O
by O
no O
means O
fair. O
You O
are O
not O
just O
to O
Harriet's O
claims. O
 O
They O
would O
be O
estimated O
very O
differently O
by O
others O
as O
well O
as O
myself; O
Mr. O
Martin O
may O
be O
the O
richest O
of O
the O
two, O
but O
he O
is O
undoubtedly O
her O
inferior O
as O
to O
rank O
in O
society.-- O
The O
sphere O
in O
which O
she O
moves O
is O
much O
above O
his.-- O
It O
would O
be O
a O
degradation." O
"A O
degradation O
to O
illegitimacy O
and O
ignorance, O
to O
be O
married O
to O
a O
respectable, O
intelligent O
gentleman-farmer!" O
"As O
to O
the O
circumstances O
of O
her O
birth, O
though O
in O
a O
legal O
sense O
she O
may O
be O
called O
Nobody, O
it O
will O
not O
hold O
in O
common O
sense. O
 O
She O
is O
not O
to O
pay O
for O
the O
offence O
of O
others, O
by O
being O
held O
below O
the O
level O
of O
those O
with O
whom O
she O
is O
brought O
up.-- O
There O
can O
scarcely O
be O
a O
doubt O
that O
her O
father O
is O
a O
gentleman-- O
and O
a O
gentleman O
of O
fortune.-- O
Her O
allowance O
is O
very O
liberal; O
nothing O
has O
ever O
been O
grudged O
for O
her O
improvement O
or O
comfort.-- O
That O
she O
is O
a O
gentleman's O
daughter, O
is O
indubitable O
to O
me; O
that O
she O
associates O
with O
gentlemen's O
daughters, O
no O
one, O
I O
apprehend, O
will O
deny.-- O
She O
is O
superior O
to O
Mr. O
Robert O
Martin." O
"Whoever O
might O
be O
her O
parents," O
said O
Mr. O
Knightley, O
"whoever O
may O
have O
had O
the O
charge O
of O
her, O
it O
does O
not O
appear O
to O
have O
been O
any O
part O
of O
their O
plan O
to O
introduce O
her O
into O
what O
you O
would O
call O
good O
society. O
After O
receiving O
a O
very O
indifferent O
education O
she O
is O
left O
in O
Mrs. O
Goddard's O
hands O
to O
shift O
as O
she O
can;-- O
to O
move, O
in O
short, O
in O
Mrs. O
Goddard's O
line, O
to O
have O
Mrs. O
Goddard's O
acquaintance. O
 O
Her O
friends O
evidently O
thought O
this O
good O
enough O
for O
her; O
and O
it O
was O
good O
enough. O
She O
desired O
nothing O
better O
herself. O
 O
Till O
you O
chose O
to O
turn O
her O
into O
a O
friend, O
her O
mind O
had O
no O
distaste O
for O
her O
own O
set, O
nor O
any O
ambition O
beyond O
it. O
 O
She O
was O
as O
happy O
as O
possible O
with O
the O
Martins O
in O
the O
summer. O
 O
She O
had O
no O
sense O
of O
superiority O
then. O
 O
If O
she O
has O
it O
now, O
you O
have O
given O
it. O
 O
You O
have O
been O
no O
friend O
to O
Harriet O
Smith, O
Emma. O
 O
Robert O
Martin O
would O
never O
have O
proceeded O
so O
far, O
if O
he O
had O
not O
felt O
persuaded O
of O
her O
not O
being O
disinclined O
to O
him. O
 O
I O
know O
him O
well. O
 O
He O
has O
too O
much O
real O
feeling O
to O
address O
any O
woman O
on O
the O
haphazard O
of O
selfish O
passion. O
And O
as O
to O
conceit, O
he O
is O
the O
farthest O
from O
it O
of O
any O
man O
I O
know. O
Depend O
upon O
it O
he O
had O
encouragement." O
It O
was O
most O
convenient O
to O
Emma O
not O
to O
make O
a O
direct O
reply O
to O
this O
assertion; O
she O
chose O
rather O
to O
take O
up O
her O
own O
line O
of O
the O
subject O
again. O
"You O
are O
a O
very O
warm O
friend O
to O
Mr. O
Martin; O
but, O
as O
I O
said O
before, O
are O
unjust O
to O
Harriet. O
 O
Harriet's O
claims O
to O
marry O
well O
are O
not O
so O
contemptible O
as O
you O
represent O
them. O
 O
She O
is O
not O
a O
clever O
girl, O
but O
she O
has O
better O
sense O
than O
you O
are O
aware O
of, O
and O
does O
not O
deserve O
to O
have O
her O
understanding O
spoken O
of O
so O
slightingly. O
 O
Waiving O
that O
point, O
however, O
and O
supposing O
her O
to O
be, O
as O
you O
describe O
her, O
only O
pretty O
and O
good-natured, O
let O
me O
tell O
you, O
that O
in O
the O
degree O
she O
possesses O
them, O
they O
are O
not O
trivial O
recommendations O
to O
the O
world O
in O
general, O
for O
she O
is, O
in O
fact, O
a O
beautiful O
girl, O
and O
must O
be O
thought O
so O
by O
ninety-nine O
people O
out O
of O
an O
hundred; O
and O
till O
it O
appears O
that O
men O
are O
much O
more O
philosophic O
on O
the O
subject O
of O
beauty O
than O
they O
are O
generally O
supposed; O
till O
they O
do O
fall O
in O
love O
with O
well-informed O
minds O
instead O
of O
handsome O
faces, O
a O
girl, O
with O
such O
loveliness O
as O
Harriet, O
has O
a O
certainty O
of O
being O
admired O
and O
sought O
after, O
of O
having O
the O
power O
of O
chusing O
from O
among O
many, O
consequently O
a O
claim O
to O
be O
nice. O
 O
Her O
good-nature, O
too, O
is O
not O
so O
very O
slight O
a O
claim, O
comprehending, O
as O
it O
does, O
real, O
thorough O
sweetness O
of O
temper O
and O
manner, O
a O
very O
humble O
opinion O
of O
herself, O
and O
a O
great O
readiness O
to O
be O
pleased O
with O
other O
people. O
 O
I O
am O
very O
much O
mistaken O
if O
your O
sex O
in O
general O
would O
not O
think O
such O
beauty, O
and O
such O
temper, O
the O
highest O
claims O
a O
woman O
could O
possess." O
"Upon O
my O
word, O
Emma, O
to O
hear O
you O
abusing O
the O
reason O
you O
have, O
is O
almost O
enough O
to O
make O
me O
think O
so O
too. O
 O
Better O
be O
without O
sense, O
than O
misapply O
it O
as O
you O
do." O
"To O
be O
sure!" O
cried O
she O
playfully. O
 O
"I O
know O
that O
is O
the O
feeling O
of O
you O
all. O
 O
I O
know O
that O
such O
a O
girl O
as O
Harriet O
is O
exactly O
what O
every O
man O
delights O
in-- O
what O
at O
once O
bewitches O
his O
senses O
and O
satisfies O
his O
judgment. O
 O
Oh! O
Harriet O
may O
pick O
and O
chuse. O
 O
Were O
you, O
yourself, O
ever O
to O
marry, O
she O
is O
the O
very O
woman O
for O
you. O
 O
And O
is O
she, O
at O
seventeen, O
just O
entering O
into O
life, O
just O
beginning O
to O
be O
known, O
to O
be O
wondered O
at O
because O
she O
does O
not O
accept O
the O
first O
offer O
she O
receives? O
No-- O
pray O
let O
her O
have O
time O
to O
look O
about O
her." O
"I O
have O
always O
thought O
it O
a O
very O
foolish O
intimacy," O
said O
Mr. O
Knightley O
presently, O
"though O
I O
have O
kept O
my O
thoughts O
to O
myself; O
but O
I O
now O
perceive O
that O
it O
will O
be O
a O
very O
unfortunate O
one O
for O
Harriet. O
 O
You O
will O
puff O
her O
up O
with O
such O
ideas O
of O
her O
own O
beauty, O
and O
of O
what O
she O
has O
a O
claim O
to, O
that, O
in O
a O
little O
while, O
nobody O
within O
her O
reach O
will O
be O
good O
enough O
for O
her. O
 O
Vanity O
working O
on O
a O
weak O
head, O
produces O
every O
sort O
of O
mischief. O
 O
Nothing O
so O
easy O
as O
for O
a O
young O
lady O
to O
raise O
her O
expectations O
too O
high. O
 O
Miss O
Harriet O
Smith O
may O
not O
find O
offers O
of O
marriage O
flow O
in O
so O
fast, O
though O
she O
is O
a O
very O
pretty O
girl. O
 O
Men O
of O
sense, O
whatever O
you O
may O
chuse O
to O
say, O
do O
not O
want O
silly O
wives. O
 O
Men O
of O
family O
would O
not O
be O
very O
fond O
of O
connecting O
themselves O
with O
a O
girl O
of O
such O
obscurity-- O
and O
most O
prudent O
men O
would O
be O
afraid O
of O
the O
inconvenience O
and O
disgrace O
they O
might O
be O
involved O
in, O
when O
the O
mystery O
of O
her O
parentage O
came O
to O
be O
revealed. O
 O
Let O
her O
marry O
Robert O
Martin, O
and O
she O
is O
safe, O
respectable, O
and O
happy O
for O
ever; O
but O
if O
you O
encourage O
her O
to O
expect O
to O
marry O
greatly, O
and O
teach O
her O
to O
be O
satisfied O
with O
nothing O
less O
than O
a O
man O
of O
consequence O
and O
large O
fortune, O
she O
may O
be O
a O
parlour-boarder O
at O
Mrs. O
Goddard's O
all O
the O
rest O
of O
her O
life-- O
or, O
at O
least, O
(for O
Harriet O
Smith O
is O
a O
girl O
who O
will O
marry O
somebody O
or O
other,) O
till O
she O
grow O
desperate, O
and O
is O
glad O
to O
catch O
at O
the O
old O
writing-master's O
son." O
"We O
think O
so O
very O
differently O
on O
this O
point, O
Mr. O
Knightley, O
that O
there O
can O
be O
no O
use O
in O
canvassing O
it. O
 O
We O
shall O
only O
be O
making O
each O
other O
more O
angry. O
 O
But O
as O
to O
my O
letting O
her O
marry O
Robert O
Martin, O
it O
is O
impossible; O
she O
has O
refused O
him, O
and O
so O
decidedly, O
I O
think, O
as O
must O
prevent O
any O
second O
application. O
 O
She O
must O
abide O
by O
the O
evil O
of O
having O
refused O
him, O
whatever O
it O
may O
be; O
and O
as O
to O
the O
refusal O
itself, O
I O
will O
not O
pretend O
to O
say O
that O
I O
might O
not O
influence O
her O
a O
little; O
but O
I O
assure O
you O
there O
was O
very O
little O
for O
me O
or O
for O
any O
body O
to O
do. O
 O
His O
appearance O
is O
so O
much O
against O
him, O
and O
his O
manner O
so O
bad, O
that O
if O
she O
ever O
were O
disposed O
to O
favour O
him, O
she O
is O
not O
now. O
 O
I O
can O
imagine, O
that O
before O
she O
had O
seen O
any O
body O
superior, O
she O
might O
tolerate O
him. O
 O
He O
was O
the O
brother O
of O
her O
friends, O
and O
he O
took O
pains O
to O
please O
her; O
and O
altogether, O
having O
seen O
nobody O
better O
(that O
must O
have O
been O
his O
great O
assistant) O
she O
might O
not, O
while O
she O
was O
at O
Abbey-Mill, O
find O
him O
disagreeable. O
 O
But O
the O
case O
is O
altered O
now. O
 O
She O
knows O
now O
what O
gentlemen O
are; O
and O
nothing O
but O
a O
gentleman O
in O
education O
and O
manner O
has O
any O
chance O
with O
Harriet." O
"Nonsense, O
errant O
nonsense, O
as O
ever O
was O
talked!" O
cried O
Mr. O
Knightley.-- O
"Robert O
Martin's O
manners O
have O
sense, O
sincerity, O
and O
good-humour O
to O
recommend O
them; O
and O
his O
mind O
has O
more O
true O
gentility O
than O
Harriet O
Smith O
could O
understand." O
Emma O
made O
no O
answer, O
and O
tried O
to O
look O
cheerfully O
unconcerned, O
but O
was O
really O
feeling O
uncomfortable O
and O
wanting O
him O
very O
much O
to O
be O
gone. O
 O
She O
did O
not O
repent O
what O
she O
had O
done; O
she O
still O
thought O
herself O
a O
better O
judge O
of O
such O
a O
point O
of O
female O
right O
and O
refinement O
than O
he O
could O
be; O
but O
yet O
she O
had O
a O
sort O
of O
habitual O
respect O
for O
his O
judgment O
in O
general, O
which O
made O
her O
dislike O
having O
it O
so O
loudly O
against O
her; O
and O
to O
have O
him O
sitting O
just O
opposite O
to O
her O
in O
angry O
state, O
was O
very O
disagreeable. O
Some O
minutes O
passed O
in O
this O
unpleasant O
silence, O
with O
only O
one O
attempt O
on O
Emma's O
side O
to O
talk O
of O
the O
weather, O
but O
he O
made O
no O
answer. O
 O
He O
was O
thinking. O
 O
The O
result O
of O
his O
thoughts O
appeared O
at O
last O
in O
these O
words. O
"Robert O
Martin O
has O
no O
great O
loss-- O
if O
he O
can O
but O
think O
so; O
and O
I O
hope O
it O
will O
not O
be O
long O
before O
he O
does. O
 O
Your O
views O
for O
Harriet O
are O
best O
known O
to O
yourself; O
but O
as O
you O
make O
no O
secret O
of O
your O
love O
of O
match-making, O
it O
is O
fair O
to O
suppose O
that O
views, O
and O
plans, O
and O
projects O
you O
have;-- O
and O
as O
a O
friend O
I O
shall O
just O
hint O
to O
you O
that O
if O
Elton O
is O
the O
man, O
I O
think O
it O
will O
be O
all O
labour O
in O
vain." O
Emma O
laughed O
and O
disclaimed. O
 O
He O
continued, O
"Depend O
upon O
it, O
Elton O
will O
not O
do. O
 O
Elton O
is O
a O
very O
good O
sort O
of O
man, O
and O
a O
very O
respectable O
vicar O
of O
Highbury, O
but O
not O
at O
all O
likely O
to O
make O
an O
imprudent O
match. O
 O
He O
knows O
the O
value O
of O
a O
good O
income O
as O
well O
as O
any O
body. O
 O
Elton O
may O
talk O
sentimentally, O
but O
he O
will O
act O
rationally. O
 O
He O
is O
as O
well O
acquainted O
with O
his O
own O
claims, O
as O
you O
can O
be O
with O
Harriet's. O
He O
knows O
that O
he O
is O
a O
very O
handsome O
young O
man, O
and O
a O
great O
favourite O
wherever O
he O
goes; O
and O
from O
his O
general O
way O
of O
talking O
in O
unreserved O
moments, O
when O
there O
are O
only O
men O
present, O
I O
am O
convinced O
that O
he O
does O
not O
mean O
to O
throw O
himself O
away. O
 O
I O
have O
heard O
him O
speak O
with O
great O
animation O
of O
a O
large O
family O
of O
young O
ladies O
that O
his O
sisters O
are O
intimate O
with, O
who O
have O
all O
twenty O
thousand O
pounds O
apiece." O
"I O
am O
very O
much O
obliged O
to O
you," O
said O
Emma, O
laughing O
again. O
 O
"If O
I O
had O
set O
my O
heart O
on O
Mr. O
Elton's O
marrying O
Harriet, O
it O
would O
have O
been O
very O
kind O
to O
open O
my O
eyes; O
but O
at O
present O
I O
only O
want O
to O
keep O
Harriet O
to O
myself. O
 O
I O
have O
done O
with O
match-making O
indeed. O
 O
I O
could O
never O
hope O
to O
equal O
my O
own O
doings O
at O
Randalls. O
 O
I O
shall O
leave O
off O
while O
I O
am O
well." O
"Good O
morning O
to O
you,"-- O
said O
he, O
rising O
and O
walking O
off O
abruptly. O
 O
He O
was O
very O
much O
vexed. O
 O
He O
felt O
the O
disappointment O
of O
the O
young O
man, O
and O
was O
mortified O
to O
have O
been O
the O
means O
of O
promoting O
it, O
by O
the O
sanction O
he O
had O
given; O
and O
the O
part O
which O
he O
was O
persuaded O
Emma O
had O
taken O
in O
the O
affair, O
was O
provoking O
him O
exceedingly. O
Emma O
remained O
in O
a O
state O
of O
vexation O
too; O
but O
there O
was O
more O
indistinctness O
in O
the O
causes O
of O
her's, O
than O
in O
his. O
 O
She O
did O
not O
always O
feel O
so O
absolutely O
satisfied O
with O
herself, O
so O
entirely O
convinced O
that O
her O
opinions O
were O
right O
and O
her O
adversary's O
wrong, O
as O
Mr. O
Knightley. O
He O
walked O
off O
in O
more O
complete O
self-approbation O
than O
he O
left O
for O
her. O
She O
was O
not O
so O
materially O
cast O
down, O
however, O
but O
that O
a O
little O
time O
and O
the O
return O
of O
Harriet O
were O
very O
adequate O
restoratives. O
 O
Harriet's O
staying O
away O
so O
long O
was O
beginning O
to O
make O
her O
uneasy. O
 O
The O
possibility O
of O
the O
young O
man's O
coming O
to O
Mrs. O
Goddard's O
that O
morning, O
and O
meeting O
with O
Harriet O
and O
pleading O
his O
own O
cause, O
gave O
alarming O
ideas. O
 O
The O
dread O
of O
such O
a O
failure O
after O
all O
became O
the O
prominent O
uneasiness; O
and O
when O
Harriet O
appeared, O
and O
in O
very O
good O
spirits, O
and O
without O
having O
any O
such O
reason O
to O
give O
for O
her O
long O
absence, O
she O
felt O
a O
satisfaction O
which O
settled O
her O
with O
her O
own O
mind, O
and O
convinced O
her, O
that O
let O
Mr. O
Knightley O
think O
or O
say O
what O
he O
would, O
she O
had O
done O
nothing O
which O
woman's O
friendship O
and O
woman's O
feelings O
would O
not O
justify. O
He O
had O
frightened O
her O
a O
little O
about O
Mr. O
Elton; O
but O
when O
she O
considered O
that O
Mr. O
Knightley O
could O
not O
have O
observed O
him O
as O
she O
had O
done, O
neither O
with O
the O
interest, O
nor O
(she O
must O
be O
allowed O
to O
tell O
herself, O
in O
spite O
of O
Mr. O
Knightley's O
pretensions) O
with O
the O
skill O
of O
such O
an O
observer O
on O
such O
a O
question O
as O
herself, O
that O
he O
had O
spoken O
it O
hastily O
and O
in O
anger, O
she O
was O
able O
to O
believe, O
that O
he O
had O
rather O
said O
what O
he O
wished O
resentfully O
to O
be O
true, O
than O
what O
he O
knew O
any O
thing O
about. O
 O
He O
certainly O
might O
have O
heard O
Mr. O
Elton O
speak O
with O
more O
unreserve O
than O
she O
had O
ever O
done, O
and O
Mr. O
Elton O
might O
not O
be O
of O
an O
imprudent, O
inconsiderate O
disposition O
as O
to O
money O
matters; O
he O
might O
naturally O
be O
rather O
attentive O
than O
otherwise O
to O
them; O
but O
then, O
Mr. O
Knightley O
did O
not O
make O
due O
allowance O
for O
the O
influence O
of O
a O
strong O
passion O
at O
war O
with O
all O
interested O
motives. O
 O
Mr. O
Knightley O
saw O
no O
such O
passion, O
and O
of O
course O
thought O
nothing O
of O
its O
effects; O
but O
she O
saw O
too O
much O
of O
it O
to O
feel O
a O
doubt O
of O
its O
overcoming O
any O
hesitations O
that O
a O
reasonable O
prudence O
might O
originally O
suggest; O
and O
more O
than O
a O
reasonable, O
becoming O
degree O
of O
prudence, O
she O
was O
very O
sure O
did O
not O
belong O
to O
Mr. O
Elton. O
Harriet's O
cheerful O
look O
and O
manner O
established O
hers: O
she O
came O
back, O
not O
to O
think O
of O
Mr. O
Martin, O
but O
to O
talk O
of O
Mr. O
Elton. O
 O
Miss O
Nash O
had O
been O
telling O
her O
something, O
which O
she O
repeated O
immediately O
with O
great O
delight. O
 O
Mr. O
Perry O
had O
been O
to O
Mrs. O
Goddard's O
to O
attend O
a O
sick O
child, O
and O
Miss O
Nash O
had O
seen O
him, O
and O
he O
had O
told O
Miss O
Nash, O
that O
as O
he O
was O
coming O
back O
yesterday O
from O
Clayton O
Park, O
he O
had O
met O
Mr. O
Elton, O
and O
found O
to O
his O
great O
surprize, O
that O
Mr. O
Elton O
was O
actually O
on O
his O
road O
to O
London, O
and O
not O
meaning O
to O
return O
till O
the O
morrow, O
though O
it O
was O
the O
whist-club O
night, O
which O
he O
had O
been O
never O
known O
to O
miss O
before; O
and O
Mr. O
Perry O
had O
remonstrated O
with O
him O
about O
it, O
and O
told O
him O
how O
shabby O
it O
was O
in O
him, O
their O
best O
player, O
to O
absent O
himself, O
and O
tried O
very O
much O
to O
persuade O
him O
to O
put O
off O
his O
journey O
only O
one O
day; O
but O
it O
would O
not O
do; O
Mr. O
Elton O
had O
been O
determined O
to O
go O
on, O
and O
had O
said O
in O
a O
very O
particular O
way O
indeed, O
that O
he O
was O
going O
on O
business O
which O
he O
would O
not O
put O
off O
for O
any O
inducement O
in O
the O
world; O
and O
something O
about O
a O
very O
enviable O
commission, O
and O
being O
the O
bearer O
of O
something O
exceedingly O
precious. O
 O
Mr. O
Perry O
could O
not O
quite O
understand O
him, O
but O
he O
was O
very O
sure O
there O
must O
be O
a O
lady O
in O
the O
case, O
and O
he O
told O
him O
so; O
and O
Mr. O
Elton O
only O
looked O
very O
conscious O
and O
smiling, O
and O
rode O
off O
in O
great O
spirits. O
 O
Miss O
Nash O
had O
told O
her O
all O
this, O
and O
had O
talked O
a O
great O
deal O
more O
about O
Mr. O
Elton; O
and O
said, O
looking O
so O
very O
significantly O
at O
her, O
"that O
she O
did O
not O
pretend O
to O
understand O
what O
his O
business O
might O
be, O
but O
she O
only O
knew O
that O
any O
woman O
whom O
Mr. O
Elton O
could O
prefer, O
she O
should O
think O
the O
luckiest O
woman O
in O
the O
world; O
for, O
beyond O
a O
doubt, O
Mr. O
Elton O
had O
not O
his O
equal O
for O
beauty O
or O
agreeableness." O

 O

 O
CHAPTER O
IX O
Mr. O
Knightley O
might O
quarrel O
with O
her, O
but O
Emma O
could O
not O
quarrel O
with O
herself. O
 O
He O
was O
so O
much O
displeased, O
that O
it O
was O
longer O
than O
usual O
before O
he O
came O
to O
Hartfield O
again; O
and O
when O
they O
did O
meet, O
his O
grave O
looks O
shewed O
that O
she O
was O
not O
forgiven. O
 O
She O
was O
sorry, O
but O
could O
not O
repent. O
 O
On O
the O
contrary, O
her O
plans O
and O
proceedings O
were O
more O
and O
more O
justified O
and O
endeared O
to O
her O
by O
the O
general O
appearances O
of O
the O
next O
few O
days. O
The O
Picture, O
elegantly O
framed, O
came O
safely O
to O
hand O
soon O
after O
Mr. O
Elton's O
return, O
and O
being O
hung O
over O
the O
mantelpiece O
of O
the O
common O
sitting-room, O
he O
got O
up O
to O
look O
at O
it, O
and O
sighed O
out O
his O
half O
sentences O
of O
admiration O
just O
as O
he O
ought; O
and O
as O
for O
Harriet's O
feelings, O
they O
were O
visibly O
forming O
themselves O
into O
as O
strong O
and O
steady O
an O
attachment O
as O
her O
youth O
and O
sort O
of O
mind O
admitted. O
 O
Emma O
was O
soon O
perfectly O
satisfied O
of O
Mr. O
Martin's O
being O
no O
otherwise O
remembered, O
than O
as O
he O
furnished O
a O
contrast O
with O
Mr. O
Elton, O
of O
the O
utmost O
advantage O
to O
the O
latter. O
Her O
views O
of O
improving O
her O
little O
friend's O
mind, O
by O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
useful O
reading O
and O
conversation, O
had O
never O
yet O
led O
to O
more O
than O
a O
few O
first O
chapters, O
and O
the O
intention O
of O
going O
on O
to-morrow. O
 O
It O
was O
much O
easier O
to O
chat O
than O
to O
study; O
much O
pleasanter O
to O
let O
her O
imagination O
range O
and O
work O
at O
Harriet's O
fortune, O
than O
to O
be O
labouring O
to O
enlarge O
her O
comprehension O
or O
exercise O
it O
on O
sober O
facts; O
and O
the O
only O
literary O
pursuit O
which O
engaged O
Harriet O
at O
present, O
the O
only O
mental O
provision O
she O
was O
making O
for O
the O
evening O
of O
life, O
was O
the O
collecting O
and O
transcribing O
all O
the O
riddles O
of O
every O
sort O
that O
she O
could O
meet O
with, O
into O
a O
thin O
quarto O
of O
hot-pressed O
paper, O
made O
up O
by O
her O
friend, O
and O
ornamented O
with O
ciphers O
and O
trophies. O
In O
this O
age O
of O
literature, O
such O
collections O
on O
a O
very O
grand O
scale O
are O
not O
uncommon. O
 O
Miss O
Nash, O
head-teacher O
at O
Mrs. O
Goddard's, O
had O
written O
out O
at O
least O
three O
hundred; O
and O
Harriet, O
who O
had O
taken O
the O
first O
hint O
of O
it O
from O
her, O
hoped, O
with O
Miss O
Woodhouse's O
help, O
to O
get O
a O
great O
many O
more. O
 O
Emma O
assisted O
with O
her O
invention, O
memory O
and O
taste; O
and O
as O
Harriet O
wrote O
a O
very O
pretty O
hand, O
it O
was O
likely O
to O
be O
an O
arrangement O
of O
the O
first O
order, O
in O
form O
as O
well O
as O
quantity. O
Mr. O
Woodhouse O
was O
almost O
as O
much O
interested O
in O
the O
business O
as O
the O
girls, O
and O
tried O
very O
often O
to O
recollect O
something O
worth O
their O
putting O
in. O
 O
"So O
many O
clever O
riddles O
as O
there O
used O
to O
be O
when O
he O
was O
young-- O
he O
wondered O
he O
could O
not O
remember O
them! O
but O
he O
hoped O
he O
should O
in O
time." O
And O
it O
always O
ended O
in O
"Kitty, O
a O
fair O
but O
frozen O
maid." O
His O
good O
friend O
Perry, O
too, O
whom O
he O
had O
spoken O
to O
on O
the O
subject, O
did O
not O
at O
present O
recollect O
any O
thing O
of O
the O
riddle O
kind; O
but O
he O
had O
desired O
Perry O
to O
be O
upon O
the O
watch, O
and O
as O
he O
went O
about O
so O
much, O
something, O
he O
thought, O
might O
come O
from O
that O
quarter. O
It O
was O
by O
no O
means O
his O
daughter's O
wish O
that O
the O
intellects O
of O
Highbury O
in O
general O
should O
be O
put O
under O
requisition. O
 O
Mr. O
Elton O
was O
the O
only O
one O
whose O
assistance O
she O
asked. O
 O
He O
was O
invited O
to O
contribute O
any O
really O
good O
enigmas, O
charades, O
or O
conundrums O
that O
he O
might O
recollect; O
and O
she O
had O
the O
pleasure O
of O
seeing O
him O
most O
intently O
at O
work O
with O
his O
recollections; O
and O
at O
the O
same O
time, O
as O
she O
could O
perceive, O
most O
earnestly O
careful O
that O
nothing O
ungallant, O
nothing O
that O
did O
not O
breathe O
a O
compliment O
to O
the O
sex O
should O
pass O
his O
lips. O
 O
They O
owed O
to O
him O
their O
two O
or O
three O
politest O
puzzles; O
and O
the O
joy O
and O
exultation O
with O
which O
at O
last O
he Entity
recalled, O
and O
rather O
sentimentally O
recited, Cue
that O
well-known O
charade, O
My Quotation
first Quotation
doth Quotation
affliction Quotation
denote, Quotation
Which Quotation
my Quotation
second Quotation
is Quotation
destin'd Quotation
to Quotation
feel Quotation
And Quotation
my Quotation
whole Quotation
is Quotation
the Quotation
best Quotation
antidote Quotation
That Quotation
affliction Quotation
to Quotation
soften Quotation
and Quotation
heal.-- Quotation
made O
her O
quite O
sorry O
to O
acknowledge O
that O
they O
had O
transcribed O
it O
some O
pages O
ago O
already. O
"Why Quotation
will Quotation
not Quotation
you Quotation
write Quotation
one Quotation
yourself Quotation
for Quotation
us, Quotation
Mr. Quotation
Elton?" Quotation
said Cue
she; Entity
"that Quotation
is Quotation
the Quotation
only Quotation
security Quotation
for Quotation
its Quotation
freshness; Quotation
and Quotation
nothing Quotation
could Quotation
be Quotation
easier Quotation
to Quotation
you." Quotation
"Oh O
no! O
he O
had O
never O
written, O
hardly O
ever, O
any O
thing O
of O
the O
kind O
in O
his O
life. O
 O
The O
stupidest O
fellow! O
He O
was O
afraid O
not O
even O
Miss O
Woodhouse"-- O
he O
stopt O
a O
moment-- O
"or O
Miss O
Smith O
could O
inspire O
him." O
The O
very O
next O
day O
however O
produced O
some O
proof O
of O
inspiration. O
 O
He O
called O
for O
a O
few O
moments, O
just O
to O
leave O
a O
piece O
of O
paper O
on O
the O
table O
containing, O
as O
he O
said, O
a O
charade, O
which O
a O
friend O
of O
his O
had O
addressed O
to O
a O
young O
lady, O
the O
object O
of O
his O
admiration, O
but O
which, O
from O
his O
manner, O
Emma O
was O
immediately O
convinced O
must O
be O
his O
own. O
"I Quotation
do Quotation
not Quotation
offer Quotation
it Quotation
for Quotation
Miss Quotation
Smith's Quotation
collection," Quotation
said Cue
he. Entity
 O
"Being Quotation
my Quotation
friend's, Quotation
I Quotation
have Quotation
no Quotation
right Quotation
to Quotation
expose Quotation
it Quotation
in Quotation
any Quotation
degree Quotation
to Quotation
the Quotation
public Quotation
eye, Quotation
but Quotation
perhaps Quotation
you Quotation
may Quotation
not Quotation
dislike Quotation
looking Quotation
at Quotation
it." Quotation
The O
speech O
was O
more O
to O
Emma Entity
than O
to O
Harriet, Entity
which O
Emma O
could O
understand. O
 O
There O
was O
deep O
consciousness O
about O
him, O
and O
he O
found O
it O
easier O
to O
meet O
her O
eye O
than O
her O
friend's. O
 O
He O
was O
gone O
the O
next O
moment:-- O
after O
another O
moment's O
pause, O
"Take Quotation
it," Quotation
said Cue
Emma, Entity
smiling, O
and O
pushing O
the O
paper O
towards O
Harriet-- Entity
"it Quotation
is Quotation
for Quotation
you. Quotation
 Quotation
Take Quotation
your Quotation
own." Quotation
But O
Harriet O
was O
in O
a O
tremor, O
and O
could O
not O
touch O
it; O
and O
Emma, O
never O
loth O
to O
be O
first, O
was O
obliged O
to O
examine O
it O
herself. O
To O
Miss-- O
CHARADE. O
My O
first O

ah! O

She O
cast O
her O
eye O
over O
it, O

the O
meaning, O
read O
it O
through O
again O
to O
be O
quite O
certain, O

quite O
mistress O
of O

while O
Harriet O
was O
puzzling O
over O
the O
paper O
in O
all O
the O
confusion O
of O

and O
dulness, O
"Very Quotation
well, Quotation
Mr. Quotation
Elton, Quotation
very Quotation
well Quotation
indeed. Quotation
 Quotation
I Quotation

a Quotation
very Quotation
good Quotation

 Quotation
I Quotation

you Quotation
credit Quotation
for Quotation
it. Quotation
 Quotation
This Quotation

feeling Quotation
your Quotation
way. Quotation
 Quotation
This Quotation

very Quotation
plainly-- Quotation
'Pray, Quotation
Miss Quotation
Smith, Quotation
give Quotation
me Quotation

my Quotation

May O
its O
approval O
beam O
in O
that O
soft O

Harriet O
exactly. O
 O
Soft O
is O
the O
very O
word O
for O
her O
eye-- O

that O

given. O
Thy O

Humph-- O
Harriet's O
ready O
wit! O
All O
the O
better. O
 O
A O
man O
must O
be O
very O
much O
in O
love, O
indeed, O
to O
describe O
her O
so. O
 O
Ah! O
Mr. O
Knightley, O
I O
wish O
you O
had O
the O
benefit O
of O
this; O
I O
think O
this O

convince O
you. O
 O
For O
once O
in O
your O

 O
An O

to O

Things O

"What Quotation

Do Quotation

Woodhouse. Quotation
 Quotation
Do Quotation
help Quotation
me. Quotation
 Quotation
I Quotation
never Quotation

any Quotation
thing Quotation
so Quotation
hard. Quotation
Is Quotation

I Quotation
wonder Quotation
who Quotation
the Quotation
friend Quotation
was-- Quotation
and Quotation
who Quotation
could Quotation

the Quotation
young Quotation
lady. Quotation
 Quotation
Do Quotation

good Quotation
one? Quotation
Can Quotation

a Quotation

Oh, Quotation
no! Quotation

Nonsense! Quotation
My Quotation

what Quotation

Where Quotation

clear O
to O

so Quotation
palpably Quotation
desirable-- Quotation
what Quotation

so Quotation
immediately Quotation
shape Quotation
itself Quotation

Dear Quotation

back Quotation

the Quotation

I Quotation

The Quotation

into Quotation

peeped Quotation

Miss Quotation

scolded Quotation
us Quotation
away, Quotation

me Quotation
back Quotation
presently, Quotation

me Quotation
look Quotation
too, Quotation
which Quotation

very Quotation
good-natured. Quotation

how Quotation
beautiful Quotation
we Quotation
thought Quotation

 Quotation
This Quotation
charade!-- Quotation
If Quotation
I Quotation
had Quotation
studied Quotation
a Quotation
twelvemonth, Quotation
I Quotation
could Quotation
never Quotation
have Quotation
made Quotation
any Quotation

"I Quotation
thought Quotation

by Quotation

manner Quotation

"I Quotation
do Quotation
think Quotation
it Quotation
is, Quotation
without Quotation
exception, Quotation
the Quotation
best Quotation
charade Quotation
I Quotation
ever Quotation
read." Quotation
"I Quotation
never Quotation
read Quotation
one Quotation
more Quotation

the Quotation

certainly." Quotation
"It Quotation
is Quotation
as Quotation
long Quotation
again Quotation
as Quotation
almost Quotation
all Quotation
we Quotation

had Quotation
before." Quotation
"I Quotation
do Quotation
not Quotation
consider Quotation
its Quotation

particularly Quotation
in Quotation
its Quotation

 Quotation
Such Quotation
things Quotation
in Quotation
general Quotation
cannot Quotation
be Quotation
too Quotation
short." Quotation
Harriet O
was O
too O
intent O
on O
the O
lines O
to O
hear. O
 O
The O
most O
satisfactory O
comparisons O
were O
rising O
in O
her O
mind. O
"It Quotation
is Quotation
one Quotation
thing," Quotation
said Cue
she, Entity
presently-- O
her O
cheeks O
in O
a O
glow-- O
"to Quotation
have Quotation
very Quotation
good Quotation
sense Quotation
in Quotation
a Quotation
common Quotation

what Quotation

this." Quotation

not O

desired O
a O
more O
spirited O
rejection O
of O
Mr. O
Martin's O
prose. O
"Such Quotation
sweet Quotation
lines!" Quotation
continued Cue
Harriet-- Entity
"these Quotation
two Quotation
last!-- Quotation
But Quotation
how Quotation
shall Quotation
I Quotation
ever Quotation
be Quotation
able Quotation
to Quotation
return Quotation
the Quotation
paper, Quotation
or Quotation
say Quotation
I Quotation
have Quotation
found Quotation
it Quotation
out?-- Quotation
Oh! Quotation
Miss Quotation
Woodhouse, Quotation
what Quotation
can Quotation
we Quotation
do Quotation
about Quotation
that?" Quotation
"Leave Quotation
it Quotation
to Quotation
me. Quotation
 Quotation
You Quotation
do Quotation
nothing. Quotation
 Quotation
He Quotation
will Quotation
be Quotation
here Quotation
this Quotation
evening, Quotation
I Quotation
dare Quotation
say, Quotation
and Quotation
then Quotation
I Quotation
will Quotation
give Quotation
it Quotation
him Quotation
back, Quotation
and Quotation
some Quotation
nonsense Quotation
or Quotation
other Quotation
will Quotation
pass Quotation
between Quotation
us, Quotation
and Quotation
you Quotation
shall Quotation
not Quotation
be Quotation
committed.-- Quotation
Your Quotation
soft Quotation
eyes Quotation
shall Quotation
chuse Quotation
their Quotation
own Quotation
time Quotation
for Quotation
beaming. Quotation
 Quotation
Trust Quotation
to Quotation
me." Quotation
"Oh! Quotation
Miss Quotation
Woodhouse, Quotation
what Quotation
a Quotation
pity Quotation
that Quotation
I Quotation
must Quotation
not Quotation
write Quotation
this Quotation
beautiful Quotation
charade Quotation
into Quotation
my Quotation
book! Quotation
I Quotation
am Quotation
sure Quotation
I Quotation
have Quotation
not Quotation
got Quotation
one Quotation
half Quotation
so Quotation
good." Quotation
"Leave Quotation
out Quotation
the Quotation
two Quotation
last Quotation
lines, Quotation
and Quotation
there Quotation
is Quotation
no Quotation
reason Quotation
why Quotation
you Quotation
should Quotation
not Quotation
write Quotation
it Quotation
into Quotation
your Quotation
book." Quotation
"Oh! Quotation
but Quotation
those Quotation
two Quotation
lines Quotation
are"-- Quotation
--"The O
best O
of O
all. O
 O
Granted;-- O
for O
private O
enjoyment; O
and O
for O
private O
enjoyment O
keep O
them. O
 O
They O
are O
not O
at O
all O
the O
less O
written O
you O
know, O
because O
you O
divide O
them. O
 O
The O
couplet O
does O
not O
cease O
to O
be, O
nor O
does O
its O
meaning O
change. O
 O
But O
take O
it O
away, O
and O
all O
appropriation O
ceases, O
and O
a O
very O
pretty O
gallant O
charade O
remains, O
fit O
for O
any O
collection. O
Depend O
upon O
it, O
he O
would O
not O
like O
to O
have O
his O
charade O
slighted, O
much O
better O
than O
his O
passion. O
 O
A O
poet O
in O
love O
must O
be O
encouraged O
in O
both O
capacities, O
or O
neither. O
 O
Give O
me O
the O
book, O
I O
will O
write O
it O
down, O
and O
then O
there O
can O
be O
no O
possible O
reflection O
on O
you." O
Harriet O
submitted, O
though O
her O
mind O
could O
hardly O
separate O
the O
parts, O
so O
as O
to O
feel O
quite O
sure O
that O
her O
friend O
were O
not O
writing O
down O
a O
declaration O
of O
love. O
 O
It O
seemed O
too O
precious O
an O
offering O
for O
any O
degree O
of O
publicity. O
"I O
shall O
never O
let O
that O
book O
go O
out O
of O
my O
own O
hands," O
said O
she. O
"Very O
well," O
replied O
Emma; O
"a O
most O
natural O
feeling; O
and O
the O
longer O
it O
lasts, O
the O
better O
I O
shall O
be O
pleased. O
 O
But O
here O
is O
my O
father O
coming: O
you O
will O
not O
object O
to O
my O
reading O
the O
charade O
to O
him. O
 O
It O
will O
be O
giving O
him O
so O
much O
pleasure! O
He O
loves O
any O
thing O
of O
the O
sort, O
and O
especially O
any O
thing O
that O
pays O
woman O
a O
compliment. O
 O
He O
has O
the O
tenderest O
spirit O
of O
gallantry O
towards O
us O
all!-- O
You O
must O
let O
me O
read O
it O
to O
him." O
Harriet O
looked O
grave. O
"My O
dear O
Harriet, O
you O
must O
not O
refine O
too O
much O
upon O
this O
charade.-- O
You O
will O
betray O
your O
feelings O
improperly, O
if O
you O
are O
too O
conscious O
and O
too O
quick, O
and O
appear O
to O
affix O
more O
meaning, O
or O
even O
quite O
all O
the O
meaning O
which O
may O
be O
affixed O
to O
it. O
 O
Do O
not O
be O
overpowered O
by O
such O
a O
little O
tribute O
of O
admiration. O
 O
If O
he O
had O
been O
anxious O
for O
secrecy, O
he O
would O
not O
have O
left O
the O
paper O
while O
I O
was O
by; O
but O
he O
rather O
pushed O
it O
towards O
me O
than O
towards O
you. O
 O
Do O
not O
let O
us O
be O
too O
solemn O
on O
the O
business. O
 O
He O
has O
encouragement O
enough O
to O
proceed, O
without O
our O
sighing O
out O
our O
souls O
over O
this O
charade." O
"Oh! O
no O
-- O
I O
hope O
I O
shall O
not O
be O
ridiculous O
about O
it. O
 O
Do O
as O
you O
please." O
Mr. O
Woodhouse O
came O
in, O
and O
very O
soon O
led O
to O
the O
subject O
again, O
by O
the O
recurrence O
of O
his O
very O
frequent O
inquiry O
of O
"Well, O
my O
dears, O
how O
does O
your O
book O
go O
on?-- O
Have O
you O
got O
any O
thing O
fresh?" O
"Yes, O
papa; O
we O
have O
something O
to O
read O
you, O
something O
quite O
fresh. O
 O
A O
piece O
of O
paper O
was O
found O
on O
the O
table O
this O
morning-- O
(dropt, O
we O
suppose, O
by O
a O
fairy)-- O
containing O
a O
very O
pretty O
charade, O
and O
we O
have O
just O
copied O
it O
in." O
She O
read O
it O
to O
him, O
just O
as O
he O
liked O
to O
have O
any O
thing O
read, O
slowly O
and O
distinctly, O
and O
two O
or O
three O
times O
over, O
with O
explanations O
of O
every O
part O
as O
she O
proceeded-- O
and O
he O
was O
very O
much O
pleased, O
and, O
as O
she O
had O
foreseen, O
especially O
struck O
with O
the O
complimentary O
conclusion. O
"Aye, O
that's O
very O
just, O
indeed, O
that's O
very O
properly O
said. O
 O
Very O
true. O
'Woman, O
lovely O
woman.' O
It O
is O
such O
a O
pretty O
charade, O
my O
dear, O
that O
I O
can O
easily O
guess O
what O
fairy O
brought O
it.-- O
Nobody O
could O
have O
written O
so O
prettily, O
but O
you, O
Emma." O
Emma O
only O
nodded, O
and O
smiled.-- O
After O
a O
little O
thinking, O
and O
a O
very O
tender O
sigh, O
he O
added, O
"Ah! O
it O
is O
no O
difficulty O
to O
see O
who O
you O
take O
after! O
Your O
dear O
mother O
was O
so O
clever O
at O
all O
those O
things! O
If O
I O
had O
but O
her O
memory! O
But O
I O
can O
remember O
nothing;-- O
not O
even O
that O
particular O
riddle O
which O
you O
have O
heard O
me O
mention; O
I O
can O
only O
recollect O
the O
first O
stanza; O
and O
there O
are O
several. O
 O
Kitty, O
a O
fair O
but O
frozen O
maid, O
Kindled O
a O
flame O
I O
yet O
deplore, O
The O
hood-wink'd O
boy O
I O
called O
to O
aid, O
Though O
of O
his O
near O
approach O
afraid, O
So O
fatal O
to O
my O
suit O
before. O
 O
And O
that O
is O
all O
that O
I O
can O
recollect O
of O
it-- O
but O
it O
is O
very O
clever O
all O
the O
way O
through. O
 O
But O
I O
think, O
my O
dear, O
you O
said O
you O
had O
got O
it." O
"Yes, O
papa, O
it O
is O
written O
out O
in O
our O
second O
page. O
 O
We O
copied O
it O
from O
the O
Elegant O
Extracts. O
 O
It O
was O
Garrick's, O
you O
know." O
"Aye, O
very O
true. O
-- O
I O
wish O
I O
could O
recollect O
more O
of O
it. O
 O
Kitty, O
a O
fair O
but O
frozen O
maid. O
 O
The O
name O
makes O
me O
think O
of O
poor O
Isabella; O
for O
she O
was O
very O
near O
being O
christened O
Catherine O
after O
her O
grandmama. O
 O
I O
hope O
we O
shall O
have O
her O
here O
next O
week. O
 O
Have O
you O
thought, O
my O
dear, O
where O
you O
shall O
put O
her-- O
and O
what O
room O
there O
will O
be O
for O
the O
children?" O
"Oh! O
yes-- O
she O
will O
have O
her O
own O
room, O
of O
course; O
the O
room O
she O
always O
has;-- O
and O
there O
is O
the O
nursery O
for O
the O
children,-- O
just O
as O
usual, O
you O
know. O
 O
Why O
should O
there O
be O
any O
change?" O
"I O
do O
not O
know, O
my O
dear-- O
but O
it O
is O
so O
long O
since O
she O
was O
here!-- O
not O
since O
last O
Easter, O
and O
then O
only O
for O
a O
few O
days.-- O
Mr. O
John O
Knightley's O
being O
a O
lawyer O
is O
very O
inconvenient.-- O
Poor O
Isabella!-- O
she O
is O
sadly O
taken O
away O
from O
us O
all!-- O
and O
how O
sorry O
she O
will O
be O
when O
she O
comes, O
not O
to O
see O
Miss O
Taylor O
here!" O
"She O
will O
not O
be O
surprized, O
papa, O
at O
least." O
"I O
do O
not O
know, O
my O
dear. O
 O
I O
am O
sure O
I O
was O
very O
much O
surprized O
when O
I O
first O
heard O
she O
was O
going O
to O
be O
married." O
"We O
must O
ask O
Mr. O
and O
Mrs. O
Weston O
to O
dine O
with O
us, O
while O
Isabella O
is O
here." O
"Yes, O
my O
dear, O
if O
there O
is O
time.-- O
But-- O
(in O
a O
very O
depressed O
tone)-- O
she O
is O
coming O
for O
only O
one O
week. O
 O
There O
will O
not O
be O
time O
for O
any O
thing." O
"It O
is O
unfortunate O
that O
they O
cannot O
stay O
longer-- O
but O
it O
seems O
a O
case O
of O
necessity. O
 O
Mr. O
John O
Knightley O
must O
be O
in O
town O
again O
on O
the O
28th, O
and O
we O
ought O
to O
be O
thankful, O
papa, O
that O
we O
are O
to O
have O
the O
whole O
of O
the O
time O
they O
can O
give O
to O
the O
country, O
that O
two O
or O
three O
days O
are O
not O
to O
be O
taken O
out O
for O
the O
Abbey. O
 O
Mr. O
Knightley O
promises O
to O
give O
up O
his O
claim O
this O
Christmas-- O
though O
you O
know O
it O
is O
longer O
since O
they O
were O
with O
him, O
than O
with O
us." O
"It O
would O
be O
very O
hard, O
indeed, O
my O
dear, O
if O
poor O
Isabella O
were O
to O
be O
anywhere O
but O
at O
Hartfield." O
Mr. O
Woodhouse O
could O
never O
allow O
for O
Mr. O
Knightley's O
claims O
on O
his O
brother, O
or O
any O
body's O
claims O
on O
Isabella, O
except O
his O
own. O
 O
He O
sat O
musing O
a O
little O
while, O
and O
then O
said, O
"But O
I O
do O
not O
see O
why O
poor O
Isabella O
should O
be O
obliged O
to O
go O
back O
so O
soon, O
though O
he O
does. O
 O
I O
think, O
Emma, O
I O
shall O
try O
and O
persuade O
her O
to O
stay O
longer O
with O
us. O
 O
She O
and O
the O
children O
might O
stay O
very O
well." O
"Ah! O
papa-- O
that O
is O
what O
you O
never O
have O
been O
able O
to O
accomplish, O
and O
I O
do O
not O
think O
you O
ever O
will. O
 O
Isabella O
cannot O
bear O
to O
stay O
behind O
her O
husband." O
This O
was O
too O
true O
for O
contradiction. O
 O
Unwelcome O
as O
it O
was, O
Mr. O
Woodhouse O
could O
only O
give O
a O
submissive O
sigh; O
and O
as O
Emma O
saw O
his O
spirits O
affected O
by O
the O
idea O
of O
his O
daughter's O
attachment O
to O
her O
husband, O
she O
immediately O
led O
to O
such O
a O
branch O
of O
the O
subject O
as O
must O
raise O
them. O
"Harriet O
must O
give O
us O
as O
much O
of O
her O
company O
as O
she O
can O
while O
my O
brother O
and O
sister O
are O
here. O
 O
I O
am O
sure O
she O
will O
be O
pleased O
with O
the O
children. O
 O
We O
are O
very O
proud O
of O
the O
children, O
are O
not O
we, O
papa? O
I O
wonder O
which O
she O
will O
think O
the O
handsomest, O
Henry O
or O
John?" O
"Aye, O
I O
wonder O
which O
she O
will. O
 O
Poor O
little O
dears, O
how O
glad O
they O
will O
be O
to O
come. O
 O
They O
are O
very O
fond O
of O
being O
at O
Hartfield, O
Harriet." O
"I O
dare O
say O
they O
are, O
sir. O
 O
I O
am O
sure O
I O
do O
not O
know O
who O
is O
not." O
"Henry O
is O
a O
fine O
boy, O
but O
John O
is O
very O
like O
his O
mama. O
 O
Henry O
is O
the O
eldest, O
he O
was O
named O
after O
me, O
not O
after O
his O
father. O
 O
John, O
the O
second, O
is O
named O
after O
his O
father. O
 O
Some O
people O
are O
surprized, O
I O
believe, O
that O
the O
eldest O
was O
not, O
but O
Isabella O
would O
have O
him O
called O
Henry, O
which O
I O
thought O
very O
pretty O
of O
her. O
 O
And O
he O
is O
a O
very O
clever O
boy, O
indeed. O
 O
They O
are O
all O
remarkably O
clever; O
and O
they O
have O
so O
many O
pretty O
ways. O
 O
They O
will O
come O
and O
stand O
by O
my O
chair, O
and O
say, O
'Grandpapa, O
can O
you O
give O
me O
a O
bit O
of O
string?' O
and O
once O
Henry O
asked O
me O
for O
a O
knife, O
but O
I O
told O
him O
knives O
were O
only O
made O
for O
grandpapas. O
 O
I O
think O
their O
father O
is O
too O
rough O
with O
them O
very O
often." O
"He O
appears O
rough O
to O
you," O
said O
Emma, O
"because O
you O
are O
so O
very O
gentle O
yourself; O
but O
if O
you O
could O
compare O
him O
with O
other O
papas, O
you O
would O
not O
think O
him O
rough. O
 O
He O
wishes O
his O
boys O
to O
be O
active O
and O
hardy; O
and O
if O
they O
misbehave, O
can O
give O
them O
a O
sharp O
word O
now O
and O
then; O
but O
he O
is O
an O
affectionate O
father-- O
certainly O
Mr. O
John O
Knightley O
is O
an O
affectionate O
father. O
 O
The O
children O
are O
all O
fond O
of O
him." O
"And O
then O
their O
uncle O
comes O
in, O
and O
tosses O
them O
up O
to O
the O
ceiling O
in O
a O
very O
frightful O
way!" O
"But O
they O
like O
it, O
papa; O
there O
is O
nothing O
they O
like O
so O
much. O
 O
It O
is O
such O
enjoyment O
to O
them, O
that O
if O
their O
uncle O
did O
not O
lay O
down O
the O
rule O
of O
their O
taking O
turns, O
whichever O
began O
would O
never O
give O
way O
to O
the O
other." O
"Well, O
I O
cannot O
understand O
it." O
"That O
is O
the O
case O
with O
us O
all, O
papa. O
 O
One O
half O
of O
the O
world O
cannot O
understand O
the O
pleasures O
of O
the O
other." O
Later O
in O
the O
morning, O
and O
just O
as O
the O
girls O
were O
going O
to O
separate O
in O
preparation O
for O
the O
regular O
four O
o'clock O
dinner, O
the O
hero O
of O
this O
inimitable O
charade O
walked O
in O
again. O
 O
Harriet O
turned O
away; O
but O
Emma O
could O
receive O
him O
with O
the O
usual O
smile, O
and O
her O
quick O
eye O
soon O
discerned O
in O
his O
the O
consciousness O
of O
having O
made O
a O
push-- O
of O
having O
thrown O
a O
die; O
and O
she O
imagined O
he O
was O
come O
to O
see O
how O
it O
might O
turn O
up. O
His O
ostensible O
reason, O
however, O
was O
to O
ask O
whether O
Mr. O
Woodhouse's O
party O
could O
be O
made O
up O
in O
the O
evening O
without O
him, O
or O
whether O
he O
should O
be O
in O
the O
smallest O
degree O
necessary O
at O
Hartfield. O
 O
If O
he O
were, O
every O
thing O
else O
must O
give O
way; O
but O
otherwise O
his O
friend O
Cole O
had O
been O
saying O
so O
much O
about O
his O
dining O
with O
him-- O
had O
made O
such O
a O
point O
of O
it, O
that O
he O
had O
promised O
him O
conditionally O
to O
come. O
Emma O
thanked O
him, O
but O
could O
not O
allow O
of O
his O
disappointing O
his O
friend O
on O
their O
account; O
her O
father O
was O
sure O
of O
his O
rubber. O
 O
He O
re-urged-- O
she O
re-declined; O
and O
he O
seemed O
then O
about O
to O
make O
his O
bow, O
when O
taking O
the O
paper O
from O
the O
table, O
she O
returned O
it-- O
"Oh! O
here O
is O
the O
charade O
you O
were O
so O
obliging O
as O
to O
leave O
with O
us; O
thank O
you O
for O
the O
sight O
of O
it. O
 O
We O
admired O
it O
so O
much, O
that O
I O
have O
ventured O
to O
write O
it O
into O
Miss O
Smith's O
collection. O
 O
Your O
friend O
will O
not O
take O
it O
amiss O
I O
hope. O
 O
Of O
course O
I O
have O
not O
transcribed O
beyond O
the O
first O
eight O
lines." O
Mr. O
Elton O
certainly O
did O
not O
very O
well O
know O
what O
to O
say. O
 O
He O
looked O
rather O
doubtingly-- O
rather O
confused; O
said O
something O
about O
"honour,"-- O
glanced O
at O
Emma O
and O
at O
Harriet, O
and O
then O
seeing O
the O
book O
open O
on O
the O
table, O
took O
it O
up, O
and O
examined O
it O
very O
attentively. O
 O
With O
the O
view O
of O
passing O
off O
an O
awkward O
moment, O
Emma O
smilingly O
said, O
"You O
must O
make O
my O
apologies O
to O
your O
friend; O
but O
so O
good O
a O
charade O
must O
not O
be O
confined O
to O
one O
or O
two. O
 O
He O
may O
be O
sure O
of O
every O
woman's O
approbation O
while O
he O
writes O
with O
such O
gallantry." O
"I O
have O
no O
hesitation O
in O
saying," O
replied O
Mr. O
Elton, O
though O
hesitating O
a O
good O
deal O
while O
he O
spoke; O
"I O
have O
no O
hesitation O
in O
saying-- O
at O
least O
if O
my O
friend O
feels O
at O
all O
as O
I O
do O
-- O
I O
have O
not O
the O
smallest O
doubt O
that, O
could O
he O
see O
his O
little O
effusion O
honoured O
as O
I O
see O
it, O
(looking O
at O
the O
book O
again, O
and O
replacing O
it O
on O
the O
table), O
he O
would O
consider O
it O
as O
the O
proudest O
moment O
of O
his O
life." O
After O
this O
speech O
he O
was O
gone O
as O
soon O
as O
possible. O
 O
Emma O
could O
not O
think O
it O
too O
soon; O
for O
with O
all O
his O
good O
and O
agreeable O
qualities, O
there O
was O
a O
sort O
of O
parade O
in O
his O
speeches O
which O
was O
very O
apt O
to O
incline O
her O
to O
laugh. O
 O
She O
ran O
away O
to O
indulge O
the O
inclination, O
leaving O
the O
tender O
and O
the O
sublime O
of O
pleasure O
to O
Harriet's O
share. O
CHAPTER O
X O
Though O
now O
the O
middle O
of O
December, O
there O
had O
yet O
been O
no O
weather O
to O
prevent O
the O
young O
ladies O
from O
tolerably O
regular O
exercise; O
and O
on O
the O
morrow, O
Emma O
had O
a O
charitable O
visit O
to O
pay O
to O
a O
poor O
sick O
family, O
who O
lived O
a O
little O
way O
out O
of O
Highbury. O
Their O
road O
to O
this O
detached O
cottage O
was O
down O
Vicarage O
Lane, O
a O
lane O
leading O
at O
right O
angles O
from O
the O
broad, O
though O
irregular, O
main O
street O
of O
the O
place; O
and, O
as O
may O
be O
inferred, O
containing O
the O
blessed O
abode O
of O
Mr. O
Elton. O
 O
A O
few O
inferior O
dwellings O
were O
first O
to O
be O
passed, O
and O
then, O
about O
a O
quarter O
of O
a O
mile O
down O
the O
lane O
rose O
the O
Vicarage, O
an O
old O
and O
not O
very O
good O
house, O
almost O
as O
close O
to O
the O
road O
as O
it O
could O
be. O
 O
It O
had O
no O
advantage O
of O
situation; O
but O
had O
been O
very O
much O
smartened O
up O
by O
the O
present O
proprietor; O
and, O
such O
as O
it O
was, O
there O
could O
be O
no O
possibility O
of O
the O
two O
friends O
passing O
it O
without O
a O
slackened O
pace O
and O
observing O
eyes.-- O
Emma's O
remark O
was-- O
"There O
it O
is. O
 O
There O
go O
you O
and O
your O
riddle-book O
one O
of O
these O
days."-- O
Harriet's O
was-- O
"Oh, O
what O
a O
sweet O
house!-- O
How O
very O
beautiful!-- O
There O
are O
the O
yellow O
curtains O
that O
Miss O
Nash O
admires O
so O
much." O
"I O
do O
not O
often O
walk O
this O
way O
now," O
said O
Emma, O
as O
they O
proceeded, O
"but O
then O
there O
will O
be O
an O
inducement, O
and O
I O
shall O
gradually O
get O
intimately O
acquainted O
with O
all O
the O
hedges, O
gates, O
pools O
and O
pollards O
of O
this O
part O
of O
Highbury." O
Harriet, O
she O
found, O
had O
never O
in O
her O
life O
been O
within O
side O
the O
Vicarage, O
and O
her O
curiosity O
to O
see O
it O
was O
so O
extreme, O
that, O
considering O
exteriors O
and O
probabilities, O
Emma O
could O
only O
class O
it, O
as O
a O
proof O
of O
love, O
with O
Mr. O
Elton's O
seeing O
ready O
wit O
in O
her. O
"I O
wish O
we O
could O
contrive O
it," O
said O
she; O
"but O
I O
cannot O
think O
of O
any O
tolerable O
pretence O
for O
going O
in;-- O
no O
servant O
that O
I O
want O
to O
inquire O
about O
of O
his O
housekeeper-- O
no O
message O
from O
my O
father." O
She O
pondered, O
but O
could O
think O
of O
nothing. O
 O
After O
a O
mutual O
silence O
of O
some O
minutes, O
Harriet O
thus O
began O
again-- O
"I O
do O
so O
wonder, O
Miss O
Woodhouse, O
that O
you O
should O
not O
be O
married, O
or O
going O
to O
be O
married! O
so O
charming O
as O
you O
are!"-- O
Emma O
laughed, O
and O
replied, O
"My O
being O
charming, O
Harriet, O
is O
not O
quite O
enough O
to O
induce O
me O
to O
marry; O
I O
must O
find O
other O
people O
charming-- O
one O
other O
person O
at O
least. O
 O
And O
I O
am O
not O
only, O
not O
going O
to O
be O
married, O
at O
present, O
but O
have O
very O
little O
intention O
of O
ever O
marrying O
at O
all." O
"Ah!-- O
so O
you O
say; O
but O
I O
cannot O
believe O
it." O
"I O
must O
see O
somebody O
very O
superior O
to O
any O
one O
I O
have O
seen O
yet, O
to O
be O
tempted; O
Mr. O
Elton, O
you O
know, O
(recollecting O
herself,) O
is O
out O
of O
the O
question: O
 O
and O
I O
do O
not O
wish O
to O
see O
any O
such O
person. O
 O
I O
would O
rather O
not O
be O
tempted. O
 O
I O
cannot O
really O
change O
for O
the O
better. O
 O
If O
I O
were O
to O
marry, O
I O
must O
expect O
to O
repent O
it." O
"Dear O
me!-- O
it O
is O
so O
odd O
to O
hear O
a O
woman O
talk O
so!"-- O
"I O
have O
none O
of O
the O
usual O
inducements O
of O
women O
to O
marry. O
 O
Were O
I O
to O
fall O
in O
love, O
indeed, O
it O
would O
be O
a O
different O
thing! O
 O
but O
I O
never O
have O
been O
in O
love; O
it O
is O
not O
my O
way, O
or O
my O
nature; O
and O
I O
do O
not O
think O
I O
ever O
shall. O
 O
And, O
without O
love, O
I O
am O
sure O
I O
should O
be O
a O
fool O
to O
change O
such O
a O
situation O
as O
mine. O
 O
Fortune O
I O
do O
not O
want; O
employment O
I O
do O
not O
want; O
consequence O
I O
do O
not O
want: O
I O
believe O
few O
married O
women O
are O
half O
as O
much O
mistress O
of O
their O
husband's O
house O
as O
I O
am O
of O
Hartfield; O
and O
never, O
never O
could O
I O
expect O
to O
be O
so O
truly O
beloved O
and O
important; O
so O
always O
first O
and O
always O
right O
in O
any O
man's O
eyes O
as O
I O
am O
in O
my O
father's." O
"But O
then, O
to O
be O
an O
old O
maid O
at O
last, O
like O
Miss O
Bates!" O
"That O
is O
as O
formidable O
an O
image O
as O
you O
could O
present, O
Harriet; O
and O
if O
I O
thought O
I O
should O
ever O
be O
like O
Miss O
Bates! O
so O
silly-- O
so O
satisfied-- O
so O
smiling-- O
so O
prosing-- O
so O
undistinguishing O
and O
unfastidious-- O
and O
so O
apt O
to O
tell O
every O
thing O
relative O
to O
every O
body O
about O
me, O
I O
would O
marry O
to-morrow. O
But O
between O
us, O
I O
am O
convinced O
there O
never O
can O
be O
any O
likeness, O
except O
in O
being O
unmarried." O
"But O
still, O
you O
will O
be O
an O
old O
maid! O
and O
that's O
so O
dreadful!" O
"Never O
mind, O
Harriet, O
I O
shall O
not O
be O
a O
poor O
old O
maid; O
and O
it O
is O
poverty O
only O
which O
makes O
celibacy O
contemptible O
to O
a O
generous O
public! O
 O
A O
single O
woman, O
with O
a O
very O
narrow O
income, O
must O
be O
a O
ridiculous, O
disagreeable O
old O
maid! O
the O
proper O
sport O
of O
boys O
and O
girls, O
but O
a O
single O
woman, O
of O
good O
fortune, O
is O
always O
respectable, O
and O
may O
be O
as O
sensible O
and O
pleasant O
as O
any O
body O
else. O
 O
And O
the O
distinction O
is O
not O
quite O
so O
much O
against O
the O
candour O
and O
common O
sense O
of O
the O
world O
as O
appears O
at O
first; O
for O
a O
very O
narrow O
income O
has O
a O
tendency O
to O
contract O
the O
mind, O
and O
sour O
the O
temper. O
 O
Those O
who O
can O
barely O
live, O
and O
who O
live O
perforce O
in O
a O
very O
small, O
and O
generally O
very O
inferior, O
society, O
may O
well O
be O
illiberal O
and O
cross. O
 O
This O
does O
not O
apply, O
however, O
to O
Miss O
Bates; O
she O
is O
only O
too O
good O
natured O
and O
too O
silly O
to O
suit O
me; O
but, O
in O
general, O
she O
is O
very O
much O
to O
the O
taste O
of O
every O
body, O
though O
single O
and O
though O
poor. O
Poverty O
certainly O
has O
not O
contracted O
her O
mind: O
 O
I O
really O
believe, O
if O
she O
had O
only O
a O
shilling O
in O
the O
world, O
she O
would O
be O
very O
likely O
to O
give O
away O
sixpence O
of O
it; O
and O
nobody O
is O
afraid O
of O
her: O
 O
that O
is O
a O
great O
charm." O
"Dear O
me! O
but O
what O
shall O
you O
do? O
how O
shall O
you O
employ O
yourself O
when O
you O
grow O
old?" O
"If O
I O
know O
myself, O
Harriet, O
mine O
is O
an O
active, O
busy O
mind, O
with O
a O
great O
many O
independent O
resources; O
and O
I O
do O
not O
perceive O
why O
I O
should O
be O
more O
in O
want O
of O
employment O
at O
forty O
or O
fifty O
than O
one-and-twenty. O
 O
Woman's O
usual O
occupations O
of O
hand O
and O
mind O
will O
be O
as O
open O
to O
me O
then O
as O
they O
are O
now; O
or O
with O
no O
important O
variation. O
 O
If O
I O
draw O
less, O
I O
shall O
read O
more; O
if O
I O
give O
up O
music, O
I O
shall O
take O
to O
carpet-work. O
 O
And O
as O
for O
objects O
of O
interest, O
objects O
for O
the O
affections, O
which O
is O
in O
truth O
the O
great O
point O
of O
inferiority, O
the O
want O
of O
which O
is O
really O
the O
great O
evil O
to O
be O
avoided O
in O
not O
marrying, O
I O
shall O
be O
very O
well O
off, O
with O
all O
the O
children O
of O
a O
sister O
I O
love O
so O
much, O
to O
care O
about. O
 O
There O
will O
be O
enough O
of O
them, O
in O
all O
probability, O
to O
supply O
every O
sort O
of O
sensation O
that O
declining O
life O
can O
need. O
 O
There O
will O
be O
enough O
for O
every O
hope O
and O
every O
fear; O
and O
though O
my O
attachment O
to O
none O
can O
equal O
that O
of O
a O
parent, O
it O
suits O
my O
ideas O
of O
comfort O
better O
than O
what O
is O
warmer O
and O
blinder. O
 O
My O
nephews O
and O
nieces! O
-- O
I O
shall O
often O
have O
a O
niece O
with O
me." O
"Do O
you O
know O
Miss O
Bates's O
niece? O
 O
That O
is, O
I O
know O
you O
must O
have O
seen O
her O
a O
hundred O
times-- O
but O
are O
you O
acquainted?" O
"Oh! O
yes; O
we O
are O
always O
forced O
to O
be O
acquainted O
whenever O
she O
comes O
to O
Highbury. O
 O
By O
the O
bye, O
that O
is O
almost O
enough O
to O
put O
one O
out O
of O
conceit O
with O
a O
niece. O
 O
Heaven O
forbid! O
at O
least, O
that O
I O
should O
ever O
bore O
people O
half O
so O
much O
about O
all O
the O
Knightleys O
together, O
as O
she O
does O
about O
Jane O
Fairfax. O
 O
One O
is O
sick O
of O
the O
very O
name O
of O
Jane O
Fairfax. O
Every O
letter O
from O
her O
is O
read O
forty O
times O
over; O
her O
compliments O
to O
all O
friends O
go O
round O
and O
round O
again; O
and O
if O
she O
does O
but O
send O
her O
aunt O
the O
pattern O
of O
a O
stomacher, O
or O
knit O
a O
pair O
of O
garters O
for O
her O
grandmother, O
one O
hears O
of O
nothing O
else O
for O
a O
month. O
 O
I O
wish O
Jane O
Fairfax O
very O
well; O
but O
she O
tires O
me O
to O
death." O
They O
were O
now O
approaching O
the O
cottage, O
and O
all O
idle O
topics O
were O
superseded. O
 O
Emma O
was O
very O
compassionate; O
and O
the O
distresses O
of O
the O
poor O
were O
as O
sure O
of O
relief O
from O
her O
personal O
attention O
and O
kindness, O
her O
counsel O
and O
her O
patience, O
as O
from O
her O
purse. O
 O
She O
understood O
their O
ways, O
could O
allow O
for O
their O
ignorance O
and O
their O
temptations, O
had O
no O
romantic O
expectations O
of O
extraordinary O
virtue O
from O
those O
for O
whom O
education O
had O
done O
so O
little; O
entered O
into O
their O
troubles O
with O
ready O
sympathy, O
and O
always O
gave O
her O
assistance O
with O
as O
much O
intelligence O
as O
good-will. O
 O
In O
the O
present O
instance, O
it O
was O
sickness O
and O
poverty O
together O
which O
she O
came O
to O
visit; O
and O
after O
remaining O
there O
as O
long O
as O
she O
could O
give O
comfort O
or O
advice, O
she O
quitted O
the O
cottage O
with O
such O
an O
impression O
of O
the O
scene O
as O
made O
her O
say O
to O
Harriet, O
as O
they O
walked O
away, O
"These O
are O
the O
sights, O
Harriet, O
to O
do O
one O
good. O
 O
How O
trifling O
they O
make O
every O
thing O
else O
appear! O
-- O
I O
feel O
now O
as O
if O
I O
could O
think O
of O
nothing O
but O
these O
poor O
creatures O
all O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
day; O
and O
yet, O
who O
can O
say O
how O
soon O
it O
may O
all O
vanish O
from O
my O
mind?" O
"Very O
true," O
said O
Harriet. O
 O
"Poor O
creatures! O
one O
can O
think O
of O
nothing O
else." O
"And O
really, O
I O
do O
not O
think O
the O
impression O
will O
soon O
be O
over," O
said O
Emma, O
as O
she O
crossed O
the O
low O
hedge, O
and O
tottering O
footstep O
which O
ended O
the O
narrow, O
slippery O
path O
through O
the O
cottage O
garden, O
and O
brought O
them O
into O
the O
lane O
again. O
 O
"I O
do O
not O
think O
it O
will," O
stopping O
to O
look O
once O
more O
at O
all O
the O
outward O
wretchedness O
of O
the O
place, O
and O
recall O
the O
still O
greater O
within. O
"Oh! O
dear, O
no," O
said O
her O
companion. O
They O
walked O
on. O
 O
The O
lane O
made O
a O
slight O
bend; O
and O
when O
that O
bend O
was O
passed, O
Mr. O
Elton O
was O
immediately O
in O
sight; O
and O
so O
near O
as O
to O
give O
Emma O
time O
only O
to O
say O
farther, O
"Ah! O
 O
Harriet, O
here O
comes O
a O
very O
sudden O
trial O
of O
our O
stability O
in O
good O
thoughts. O
 O
Well, O
(smiling,) O
I O
hope O
it O
may O
be O
allowed O
that O
if O
compassion O
has O
produced O
exertion O
and O
relief O
to O
the O
sufferers, O
it O
has O
done O
all O
that O
is O
truly O
important. O
 O
If O
we O
feel O
for O
the O
wretched, O
enough O
to O
do O
all O
we O
can O
for O
them, O
the O
rest O
is O
empty O
sympathy, O
only O
distressing O
to O
ourselves." O
Harriet O
could O
just O
answer, O
"Oh! O
dear, O
yes," O
before O
the O
gentleman O
joined O
them. O
 O
The O
wants O
and O
sufferings O
of O
the O
poor O
family, O
however, O
were O
the O
first O
subject O
on O
meeting. O
 O
He O
had O
been O
going O
to O
call O
on O
them. O
 O
His O
visit O
he O
would O
now O
defer; O
but O
they O
had O
a O
very O
interesting O
parley O
about O
what O
could O
be O
done O
and O
should O
be O
done. O
 O
Mr. O
Elton O
then O
turned O
back O
to O
accompany O
them. O
"To O
fall O
in O
with O
each O
other O
on O
such O
an O
errand O
as O
this," O
thought O
Emma; O
"to O
meet O
in O
a O
charitable O
scheme; O
this O
will O
bring O
a O
great O
increase O
of O
love O
on O
each O
side. O
 O
I O
should O
not O
wonder O
if O
it O
were O
to O
bring O
on O
the O
declaration. O
 O
It O
must, O
if O
I O
were O
not O
here. O
 O
I O
wish O
I O
were O
anywhere O
else." O
Anxious O
to O
separate O
herself O
from O
them O
as O
far O
as O
she O
could, O
she O
soon O
afterwards O
took O
possession O
of O
a O
narrow O
footpath, O
a O
little O
raised O
on O
one O
side O
of O
the O
lane, O
leaving O
them O
together O
in O
the O
main O
road. O
 O
But O
she O
had O
not O
been O
there O
two O
minutes O
when O
she O
found O
that O
Harriet's O
habits O
of O
dependence O
and O
imitation O
were O
bringing O
her O
up O
too, O
and O
that, O
in O
short, O
they O
would O
both O
be O
soon O
after O
her. O
 O
This O
would O
not O
do; O
she O
immediately O
stopped, O
under O
pretence O
of O
having O
some O
alteration O
to O
make O
in O
the O
lacing O
of O
her O
half-boot, O
and O
stooping O
down O
in O
complete O
occupation O
of O
the O
footpath, O
begged O
them O
to O
have O
the O
goodness O
to O
walk O
on, O
and O
she O
would O
follow O
in O
half O
a O
minute. O
 O
They O
did O
as O
they O
were O
desired; O
and O
by O
the O
time O
she O
judged O
it O
reasonable O
to O
have O
done O
with O
her O
boot, O
she O
had O
the O
comfort O
of O
farther O
delay O
in O
her O
power, O
being O
overtaken O
by O
a O
child O
from O
the O
cottage, O
setting O
out, O
according O
to O
orders, O
with O
her O
pitcher, O
to O
fetch O
broth O
from O
Hartfield. O
 O
To O
walk O
by O
the O
side O
of O
this O
child, O
and O
talk O
to O
and O
question O
her, O
was O
the O
most O
natural O
thing O
in O
the O
world, O
or O
would O
have O
been O
the O
most O
natural, O
had O
she O
been O
acting O
just O
then O
without O
design; O
and O
by O
this O
means O
the O
others O
were O
still O
able O
to O
keep O
ahead, O
without O
any O
obligation O
of O
waiting O
for O
her. O
 O
She O
gained O
on O
them, O
however, O
involuntarily: O
 O
the O
child's O
pace O
was O
quick, O
and O
theirs O
rather O
slow; O
and O
she O
was O
the O
more O
concerned O
at O
it, O
from O
their O
being O
evidently O
in O
a O
conversation O
which O
interested O
them. O
 O
Mr. O
Elton O
was O
speaking O
with O
animation, O
Harriet O
listening O
with O
a O
very O
pleased O
attention; O
and O
Emma, O
having O
sent O
the O
child O
on, O
was O
beginning O
to O
think O
how O
she O
might O
draw O
back O
a O
little O
more, O
when O
they O
both O
looked O
around, O
and O
she O
was O
obliged O
to O
join O
them. O
Mr. O
Elton O
was O
still O
talking, O
still O
engaged O
in O
some O
interesting O
detail; O
and O
Emma O
experienced O
some O
disappointment O
when O
she O
found O
that O
he O
was O
only O
giving O
his O
fair O
companion O
an O
account O
of O
the O
yesterday's O
party O
at O
his O
friend O
Cole's, O
and O
that O
she O
was O
come O
in O
herself O
for O
the O
Stilton O
cheese, O
the O
north O
Wiltshire, O
the O
butter, O
the O
cellery, O
the O
beet-root, O
and O
all O
the O
dessert. O
"This O
would O
soon O
have O
led O
to O
something O
better, O
of O
course," O
was O
her O
consoling O
reflection; O
"any O
thing O
interests O
between O
those O
who O
love; O
and O
any O
thing O
will O
serve O
as O
introduction O
to O
what O
is O
near O
the O
heart. O
 O
If O
I O
could O
but O
have O
kept O
longer O
away!" O
They O
now O
walked O
on O
together O
quietly, O
till O
within O
view O
of O
the O
vicarage O
pales, O
when O
a O
sudden O
resolution, O
of O
at O
least O
getting O
Harriet O
into O
the O
house, O
made O
her O
again O
find O
something O
very O
much O
amiss O
about O
her O
boot, O
and O
fall O
behind O
to O
arrange O
it O
once O
more. O
 O
She O
then O
broke O
the O
lace O
off O
short, O
and O
dexterously O
throwing O
it O
into O
a O
ditch, O
was O
presently O
obliged O
to O
entreat O
them O
to O
stop, O
and O
acknowledged O
her O
inability O
to O
put O
herself O
to O
rights O
so O
as O
to O
be O
able O
to O
walk O
home O
in O
tolerable O
comfort. O
"Part O
of O
my O
lace O
is O
gone," O
said O
she, O
"and O
I O
do O
not O
know O
how O
I O
am O
to O
contrive. O
 O
I O
really O
am O
a O
most O
troublesome O
companion O
to O
you O
both, O
but O
I O
hope O
I O
am O
not O
often O
so O
ill-equipped. O
Mr. O
Elton, O
I O
must O
beg O
leave O
to O
stop O
at O
your O
house, O
and O
ask O
your O
housekeeper O
for O
a O
bit O
of O
ribband O
or O
string, O
or O
any O
thing O
just O
to O
keep O
my O
boot O
on." O
Mr. O
Elton O
looked O
all O
happiness O
at O
this O
proposition; O
and O
nothing O
could O
exceed O
his O
alertness O
and O
attention O
in O
conducting O
them O
into O
his O
house O
and O
endeavouring O
to O
make O
every O
thing O
appear O
to O
advantage. O
 O
The O
room O
they O
were O
taken O
into O
was O
the O
one O
he O
chiefly O
occupied, O
and O
looking O
forwards; O
behind O
it O
was O
another O
with O
which O
it O
immediately O
communicated; O
the O
door O
between O
them O
was O
open, O
and O
Emma O
passed O
into O
it O
with O
the O
housekeeper O
to O
receive O
her O
assistance O
in O
the O
most O
comfortable O
manner. O
She O
was O
obliged O
to O
leave O
the O
door O
ajar O
as O
she O
found O
it; O
but O
she O
fully O
intended O
that O
Mr. O
Elton O
should O
close O
it. O
 O
It O
was O
not O
closed, O
however, O
it O
still O
remained O
ajar; O
but O
by O
engaging O
the O
housekeeper O
in O
incessant O
conversation, O
she O
hoped O
to O
make O
it O
practicable O
for O
him O
to O
chuse O
his O
own O
subject O
in O
the O
adjoining O
room. O
 O
For O
ten O
minutes O
she O
could O
hear O
nothing O
but O
herself. O
 O
It O
could O
be O
protracted O
no O
longer. O
 O
She O
was O
then O
obliged O
to O
be O
finished, O
and O
make O
her O
appearance. O
The O
lovers O
were O
standing O
together O
at O
one O
of O
the O
windows. O
 O
It O
had O
a O
most O
favourable O
aspect; O
and, O
for O
half O
a O
minute, O
Emma O
felt O
the O
glory O
of O
having O
schemed O
successfully. O
 O
But O
it O
would O
not O
do; O
he O
had O
not O
come O
to O
the O
point. O
 O
He O
had O
been O
most O
agreeable, O
most O
delightful; O
he O
had O
told O
Harriet O
that O
he O
had O
seen O
them O
go O
by, O
and O
had O
purposely O
followed O
them; O
other O
little O
gallantries O
and O
allusions O
had O
been O
dropt, O
but O
nothing O
serious. O
"Cautious, O
very O
cautious," O
thought O
Emma; O
"he O
advances O
inch O
by O
inch, O
and O
will O
hazard O
nothing O
till O
he O
believes O
himself O
secure." O
Still, O
however, O
though O
every O
thing O
had O
not O
been O
accomplished O
by O
her O
ingenious O
device, O
she O
could O
not O
but O
flatter O
herself O
that O
it O
had O
been O
the O
occasion O
of O
much O
present O
enjoyment O
to O
both, O
and O
must O
be O
leading O
them O
forward O
to O
the O
great O
event. O
CHAPTER O
XI O
Mr. O
Elton O
must O
now O
be O
left O
to O
himself. O
 O
It O
was O
no O
longer O
in O
Emma's O
power O
to O
superintend O
his O
happiness O
or O
quicken O
his O
measures. O
 O
The O
coming O
of O
her O
sister's O
family O
was O
so O
very O
near O
at O
hand, O
that O
first O
in O
anticipation, O
and O
then O
in O
reality, O
it O
became O
henceforth O
her O
prime O
object O
of O
interest; O
and O
during O
the O
ten O
days O
of O
their O
stay O
at O
Hartfield O
it O
was O
not O
to O
be O
expected-- O
she O
did O
not O
herself O
expect-- O
that O
any O
thing O
beyond O
occasional, O
fortuitous O
assistance O
could O
be O
afforded O
by O
her O
to O
the O
lovers. O
 O
They O
might O
advance O
rapidly O
if O
they O
would, O
however; O
they O
must O
advance O
somehow O
or O
other O
whether O
they O
would O
or O
no. O
 O
She O
hardly O
wished O
to O
have O
more O
leisure O
for O
them. O
 O
There O
are O
people, O
who O
the O
more O
you O
do O
for O
them, O
the O
less O
they O
will O
do O
for O
themselves. O
Mr. O
and O
Mrs. O
John O
Knightley, O
from O
having O
been O
longer O
than O
usual O
absent O
from O
Surry, O
were O
exciting O
of O
course O
rather O
more O
than O
the O
usual O
interest. O
 O
Till O
this O
year, O
every O
long O
vacation O
since O
their O
marriage O
had O
been O
divided O
between O
Hartfield O
and O
Donwell O
Abbey; O
but O
all O
the O
holidays O
of O
this O
autumn O
had O
been O
given O
to O
sea-bathing O
for O
the O
children, O
and O
it O
was O
therefore O
many O
months O
since O
they O
had O
been O
seen O
in O
a O
regular O
way O
by O
their O
Surry O
connexions, O
or O
seen O
at O
all O
by O
Mr. O
Woodhouse, O
who O
could O
not O
be O
induced O
to O
get O
so O
far O
as O
London, O
even O
for O
poor O
Isabella's O
sake; O
and O
who O
consequently O
was O
now O
most O
nervously O
and O
apprehensively O
happy O
in O
forestalling O
this O
too O
short O
visit. O
He O
thought O
much O
of O
the O
evils O
of O
the O
journey O
for O
her, O
and O
not O
a O
little O
of O
the O
fatigues O
of O
his O
own O
horses O
and O
coachman O
who O
were O
to O
bring O
some O
of O
the O
party O
the O
last O
half O
of O
the O
way; O
but O
his O
alarms O
were O
needless; O
the O
sixteen O
miles O
being O
happily O
accomplished, O
and O
Mr. O
and O
Mrs. O
John O
Knightley, O
their O
five O
children, O
and O
a O
competent O
number O
of O
nursery-maids, O
all O
reaching O
Hartfield O
in O
safety. O
 O
The O
bustle O
and O
joy O
of O
such O
an O
arrival, O
the O
many O
to O
be O
talked O
to, O
welcomed, O
encouraged, O
and O
variously O
dispersed O
and O
disposed O
of, O
produced O
a O
noise O
and O
confusion O
which O
his O
nerves O
could O
not O
have O
borne O
under O
any O
other O
cause, O
nor O
have O
endured O
much O
longer O
even O
for O
this; O
but O
the O
ways O
of O
Hartfield O
and O
the O
feelings O
of O
her O
father O
were O
so O
respected O
by O
Mrs. O
John O
Knightley, O
that O
in O
spite O
of O
maternal O
solicitude O
for O
the O
immediate O
enjoyment O
of O
her O
little O
ones, O
and O
for O
their O
having O
instantly O
all O
the O
liberty O
and O
attendance, O
all O
the O
eating O
and O
drinking, O
and O
sleeping O
and O
playing, O
which O
they O
could O
possibly O
wish O
for, O
without O
the O
smallest O
delay, O
the O
children O
were O
never O
allowed O
to O
be O
long O
a O
disturbance O
to O
him, O
either O
in O
themselves O
or O
in O
any O
restless O
attendance O
on O
them. O
Mrs. O
John O
Knightley O
was O
a O
pretty, O
elegant O
little O
woman, O
of O
gentle, O
quiet O
manners, O
and O
a O
disposition O
remarkably O
amiable O
and O
affectionate; O
wrapt O
up O
in O
her O
family; O
a O
devoted O
wife, O
a O
doating O
mother, O
and O
so O
tenderly O
attached O
to O
her O
father O
and O
sister O
that, O
but O
for O
these O
higher O
ties, O
a O
warmer O
love O
might O
have O
seemed O
impossible. O
 O
She O
could O
never O
see O
a O
fault O
in O
any O
of O
them. O
 O
She O
was O
not O
a O
woman O
of O
strong O
understanding O
or O
any O
quickness; O
and O
with O
this O
resemblance O
of O
her O
father, O
she O
inherited O
also O
much O
of O
his O
constitution; O
was O
delicate O
in O
her O
own O
health, O
over-careful O
of O
that O
of O
her O
children, O
had O
many O
fears O
and O
many O
nerves, O
and O
was O
as O
fond O
of O
her O
own O
Mr. O
Wingfield O
in O
town O
as O
her O
father O
could O
be O
of O
Mr. O
Perry. O
 O
They O
were O
alike O
too, O
in O
a O
general O
benevolence O
of O
temper, O
and O
a O
strong O
habit O
of O
regard O
for O
every O
old O
acquaintance. O
Mr. O
John O
Knightley O
was O
a O
tall, O
gentleman-like, O
and O
very O
clever O
man; O
rising O
in O
his O
profession, O
domestic, O
and O
respectable O
in O
his O
private O
character; O
but O
with O
reserved O
manners O
which O
prevented O
his O
being O
generally O
pleasing; O
and O
capable O
of O
being O
sometimes O
out O
of O
humour. O
 O
He O
was O
not O
an O
ill-tempered O
man, O
not O
so O
often O
unreasonably O
cross O
as O
to O
deserve O
such O
a O
reproach; O
but O
his O
temper O
was O
not O
his O
great O
perfection; O
and, O
indeed, O
with O
such O
a O
worshipping O
wife, O
it O
was O
hardly O
possible O
that O
any O
natural O
defects O
in O
it O
should O
not O
be O
increased. O
 O
The O
extreme O
sweetness O
of O
her O
temper O
must O
hurt O
his. O
 O
He O
had O
all O
the O
clearness O
and O
quickness O
of O
mind O
which O
she O
wanted, O
and O
he O
could O
sometimes O
act O
an O
ungracious, O
or O
say O
a O
severe O
thing. O
He O
was O
not O
a O
great O
favourite O
with O
his O
fair O
sister-in-law. O
Nothing O
wrong O
in O
him O
escaped O
her. O
 O
She O
was O
quick O
in O
feeling O
the O
little O
injuries O
to O
Isabella, O
which O
Isabella O
never O
felt O
herself. O
 O
Perhaps O
she O
might O
have O
passed O
over O
more O
had O
his O
manners O
been O
flattering O
to O
Isabella's O
sister, O
but O
they O
were O
only O
those O
of O
a O
calmly O
kind O
brother O
and O
friend, O
without O
praise O
and O
without O
blindness; O
but O
hardly O
any O
degree O
of O
personal O
compliment O
could O
have O
made O
her O
regardless O
of O
that O
greatest O
fault O
of O
all O
in O
her O
eyes O
which O
he O
sometimes O
fell O
into, O
the O
want O
of O
respectful O
forbearance O
towards O
her O
father. O
 O
There O
he O
had O
not O
always O
the O
patience O
that O
could O
have O
been O
wished. O
 O
Mr. O
Woodhouse's O
peculiarities O
and O
fidgetiness O
were O
sometimes O
provoking O
him O
to O
a O
rational O
remonstrance O
or O
sharp O
retort O
equally O
ill-bestowed. O
 O
It O
did O
not O
often O
happen; O
for O
Mr. O
John O
Knightley O
had O
really O
a O
great O
regard O
for O
his O
father-in-law, O
and O
generally O
a O
strong O
sense O
of O
what O
was O
due O
to O
him; O
but O
it O
was O
too O
often O
for O
Emma's O
charity, O
especially O
as O
there O
was O
all O
the O
pain O
of O
apprehension O
frequently O
to O
be O
endured, O
though O
the O
offence O
came O
not. O
The O
beginning, O
however, O
of O
every O
visit O
displayed O
none O
but O
the O
properest O
feelings, O
and O
this O
being O
of O
necessity O
so O
short O
might O
be O
hoped O
to O
pass O
away O
in O
unsullied O
cordiality. O
 O
They O
had O
not O
been O
long O
seated O
and O
composed O
when O
Mr. O
Woodhouse, O
with O
a O
melancholy O
shake O
of O
the O
head O
and O
a O
sigh, O
called O
his O
daughter's O
attention O
to O
the O
sad O
change O
at O
Hartfield O
since O
she O
had O
been O
there O
last. O
"Ah, O
my O
dear," O
said O
he, O
"poor O
Miss O
Taylor-- O
It O
is O
a O
grievous O
business." O
"Oh O
yes, O
sir," O
cried O
she O
with O
ready O
sympathy, O
"how O
you O
must O
miss O
her! O
And O
dear O
Emma, O
too!-- O
What O
a O
dreadful O
loss O
to O
you O
both! O
-- O
I O
have O
been O
so O
grieved O
for O
you. O
-- O
I O
could O
not O
imagine O
how O
you O
could O
possibly O
do O
without O
her.-- O
It O
is O
a O
sad O
change O
indeed.-- O
But O
I O
hope O
she O
is O
pretty O
well, O
sir." O
"Pretty O
well, O
my O
dear O
-- O
I O
hope-- O
pretty O
well. O
-- O
I O
do O
not O
know O
but O
that O
the O
place O
agrees O
with O
her O
tolerably." O
Mr. O
John O
Knightley O
here O
asked O
Emma O
quietly O
whether O
there O
were O
any O
doubts O
of O
the O
air O
of O
Randalls. O
"Oh! O
no-- O
none O
in O
the O
least. O
 O
I O
never O
saw O
Mrs. O
Weston O
better O
in O
my O
life-- O
never O
looking O
so O
well. O
 O
Papa O
is O
only O
speaking O
his O
own O
regret." O
"Very O
much O
to O
the O
honour O
of O
both," O
was O
the O
handsome O
reply. O
"And O
do O
you O
see O
her, O
sir, O
tolerably O
often?" O
asked O
Isabella O
in O
the O
plaintive O
tone O
which O
just O
suited O
her O
father. O
Mr. O
Woodhouse O
hesitated.-- O
"Not O
near O
so O
often, O
my O
dear, O
as O
I O
could O
wish." O
"Oh! O
papa, O
we O
have O
missed O
seeing O
them O
but O
one O
entire O
day O
since O
they O
married. O
 O
Either O
in O
the O
morning O
or O
evening O
of O
every O
day, O
excepting O
one, O
have O
we O
seen O
either O
Mr. O
Weston O
or O
Mrs. O
Weston, O
and O
generally O
both, O
either O
at O
Randalls O
or O
here-- O
and O
as O
you O
may O
suppose, O
Isabella, O
most O
frequently O
here. O
 O
They O
are O
very, O
very O
kind O
in O
their O
visits. O
 O
Mr. O
Weston O
is O
really O
as O
kind O
as O
herself. O
 O
Papa, O
if O
you O
speak O
in O
that O
melancholy O
way, O
you O
will O
be O
giving O
Isabella O
a O
false O
idea O
of O
us O
all. O
 O
Every O
body O
must O
be O
aware O
that O
Miss O
Taylor O
must O
be O
missed, O
but O
every O
body O
ought O
also O
to O
be O
assured O
that O
Mr. O
and O
Mrs. O
Weston O
do O
really O
prevent O
our O
missing O
her O
by O
any O
means O
to O
the O
extent O
we O
ourselves O
anticipated-- O
which O
is O
the O
exact O
truth." O
"Just O
as O
it O
should O
be," O
said O
Mr. O
John O
Knightley, O
"and O
just O
as O
I O
hoped O
it O
was O
from O
your O
letters. O
 O
Her O
wish O
of O
shewing O
you O
attention O
could O
not O
be O
doubted, O
and O
his O
being O
a O
disengaged O
and O
social O
man O
makes O
it O
all O
easy. O
 O
I O
have O
been O
always O
telling O
you, O
my O
love, O
that O
I O
had O
no O
idea O
of O
the O
change O
being O
so O
very O
material O
to O
Hartfield O
as O
you O
apprehended; O
and O
now O
you O
have O
Emma's O
account, O
I O
hope O
you O
will O
be O
satisfied." O
"Why, O
to O
be O
sure," O
said O
Mr. O
Woodhouse-- O
"yes, O
certainly O
-- O
I O
cannot O
deny O
that O
Mrs. O
Weston, O
poor O
Mrs. O
Weston, O
does O
come O
and O
see O
us O
pretty O
often-- O
but O
then-- O
she O
is O
always O
obliged O
to O
go O
away O
again." O
"It O
would O
be O
very O
hard O
upon O
Mr. O
Weston O
if O
she O
did O
not, O
papa.-- O
You O
quite O
forget O
poor O
Mr. O
Weston." O
"I O
think, O
indeed," O
said O
John O
Knightley O
pleasantly, O
"that O
Mr. O
Weston O
has O
some O
little O
claim. O
 O
You O
and O
I, O
Emma, O
will O
venture O
to O
take O
the O
part O
of O
the O
poor O
husband. O
 O
I, O
being O
a O
husband, O
and O
you O
not O
being O
a O
wife, O
the O
claims O
of O
the O
man O
may O
very O
likely O
strike O
us O
with O
equal O
force. O
 O
As O
for O
Isabella, O
she O
has O
been O
married O
long O
enough O
to O
see O
the O
convenience O
of O
putting O
all O
the O
Mr. O
Westons O
aside O
as O
much O
as O
she O
can." O
"Me, O
my O
love," O
cried O
his O
wife, O
hearing O
and O
understanding O
only O
in O
part.-- O
"Are O
you O
talking O
about O
me? O
-- O
I O
am O
sure O
nobody O
ought O
to O
be, O
or O
can O
be, O
a O
greater O
advocate O
for O
matrimony O
than O
I O
am; O
and O
if O
it O
had O
not O
been O
for O
the O
misery O
of O
her O
leaving O
Hartfield, O
I O
should O
never O
have O
thought O
of O
Miss O
Taylor O
but O
as O
the O
most O
fortunate O
woman O
in O
the O
world; O
and O
as O
to O
slighting O
Mr. O
Weston, O
that O
excellent O
Mr. O
Weston, O
I O
think O
there O
is O
nothing O
he O
does O
not O
deserve. O
 O
I O
believe O
he O
is O
one O
of O
the O
very O
best-tempered O
men O
that O
ever O
existed. O
 O
Excepting O
yourself O
and O
your O
brother, O
I O
do O
not O
know O
his O
equal O
for O
temper. O
 O
I O
shall O
never O
forget O
his O
flying O
Henry's O
kite O
for O
him O
that O
very O
windy O
day O
last O
Easter-- O
and O
ever O
since O
his O
particular O
kindness O
last O
September O
twelvemonth O
in O
writing O
that O
note, O
at O
twelve O
o'clock O
at O
night, O
on O
purpose O
to O
assure O
me O
that O
there O
was O
no O
scarlet O
fever O
at O
Cobham, O
I O
have O
been O
convinced O
there O
could O
not O
be O
a O
more O
feeling O
heart O
nor O
a O
better O
man O
in O
existence.-- O
If O
any O
body O
can O
deserve O
him, O
it O
must O
be O
Miss O
Taylor." O
"Where O
is O
the O
young O
man?" O
said O
John O
Knightley. O
 O
"Has O
he O
been O
here O
on O
this O
occasion-- O
or O
has O
he O
not?" O
"He O
has O
not O
been O
here O
yet," O
replied O
Emma. O
 O
"There O
was O
a O
strong O
expectation O
of O
his O
coming O
soon O
after O
the O
marriage, O
but O
it O
ended O
in O
nothing; O
and O
I O
have O
not O
heard O
him O
mentioned O
lately." O
"But O
you O
should O
tell O
them O
of O
the O
letter, O
my O
dear," O
said O
her O
father. O
"He O
wrote O
a O
letter O
to O
poor O
Mrs. O
Weston, O
to O
congratulate O
her, O
and O
a O
very O
proper, O
handsome O
letter O
it O
was. O
 O
She O
shewed O
it O
to O
me. O
 O
I O
thought O
it O
very O
well O
done O
of O
him O
indeed. O
 O
Whether O
it O
was O
his O
own O
idea O
you O
know, O
one O
cannot O
tell. O
 O
He O
is O
but O
young, O
and O
his O
uncle, O
perhaps O
-- O
" O
"My O
dear O
papa, O
he O
is O
three-and-twenty. O
You O
forget O
how O
time O
passes." O
"Three-and-twenty!-- O
is O
he O
indeed?-- O
Well, O
I O
could O
not O
have O
thought O
it-- O
and O
he O
was O
but O
two O
years O
old O
when O
he O
lost O
his O
poor O
mother! O
 O
Well, O
time O
does O
fly O
indeed!-- O
and O
my O
memory O
is O
very O
bad. O
 O
However, O
it O
was O
an O
exceeding O
good, O
pretty O
letter, O
and O
gave O
Mr. O
and O
Mrs. O
Weston O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
pleasure. O
 O
I O
remember O
it O
was O
written O
from O
Weymouth, O
and O
dated O
Sept. O
28th-- O
and O
began, O
'My O
dear O
Madam,' O
but O
I O
forget O
how O
it O
went O
on; O
and O
it O
was O
signed O
'F. O
C. O
Weston O
Churchill.'-- O
I O
remember O
that O
perfectly." O
"How O
very O
pleasing O
and O
proper O
of O
him!" O
cried O
the O
good-hearted O
Mrs. O
John O
Knightley. O
 O
"I O
have O
no O
doubt O
of O
his O
being O
a O
most O
amiable O
young O
man. O
But O
how O
sad O
it O
is O
that O
he O
should O
not O
live O
at O
home O
with O
his O
father! O
There O
is O
something O
so O
shocking O
in O
a O
child's O
being O
taken O
away O
from O
his O
parents O
and O
natural O
home! O
 O
I O
never O
could O
comprehend O
how O
Mr. O
Weston O
could O
part O
with O
him. O
 O
To O
give O
up O
one's O
child! O
 O
I O
really O
never O
could O
think O
well O
of O
any O
body O
who O
proposed O
such O
a O
thing O
to O
any O
body O
else." O
"Nobody O
ever O
did O
think O
well O
of O
the O
Churchills, O
I O
fancy," O
observed O
Mr. O
John O
Knightley O
coolly. O
 O
"But O
you O
need O
not O
imagine O
Mr. O
Weston O
to O
have O
felt O
what O
you O
would O
feel O
in O
giving O
up O
Henry O
or O
John. O
 O
Mr. O
Weston O
is O
rather O
an O
easy, O
cheerful-tempered O
man, O
than O
a O
man O
of O
strong O
feelings; O
he O
takes O
things O
as O
he O
finds O
them, O
and O
makes O
enjoyment O
of O
them O
somehow O
or O
other, O
depending, O
I O
suspect, O
much O
more O
upon O
what O
is O
called O
society O
for O
his O
comforts, O
that O
is, O
upon O
the O
power O
of O
eating O
and O
drinking, O
and O
playing O
whist O
with O
his O
neighbours O
five O
times O
a O
week, O
than O
upon O
family O
affection, O
or O
any O
thing O
that O
home O
affords." O
Emma O
could O
not O
like O
what O
bordered O
on O
a O
reflection O
on O
Mr. O
Weston, O
and O
had O
half O
a O
mind O
to O
take O
it O
up; O
but O
she O
struggled, O
and O
let O
it O
pass. O
 O
She O
would O
keep O
the O
peace O
if O
possible; O
and O
there O
was O
something O
honourable O
and O
valuable O
in O
the O
strong O
domestic O
habits, O
the O
all-sufficiency O
of O
home O
to O
himself, O
whence O
resulted O
her O
brother's O
disposition O
to O
look O
down O
on O
the O
common O
rate O
of O
social O
intercourse, O
and O
those O
to O
whom O
it O
was O
important.-- O
It O
had O
a O
high O
claim O
to O
forbearance. O
CHAPTER O
XII O
Mr. O
Knightley O
was O
to O
dine O
with O
them-- O
rather O
against O
the O
inclination O
of O
Mr. O
Woodhouse, O
who O
did O
not O
like O
that O
any O
one O
should O
share O
with O
him O
in O
Isabella's O
first O
day. O
 O
Emma's O
sense O
of O
right O
however O
had O
decided O
it; O
and O
besides O
the O
consideration O
of O
what O
was O
due O
to O
each O
brother, O
she O
had O
particular O
pleasure, O
from O
the O
circumstance O
of O
the O
late O
disagreement O
between O
Mr. O
Knightley O
and O
herself, O
in O
procuring O
him O
the O
proper O
invitation. O
She O
hoped O
they O
might O
now O
become O
friends O
again. O
 O
She O
thought O
it O
was O
time O
to O
make O
up. O
 O
Making-up O
indeed O
would O
not O
do. O
 O
She O
certainly O
had O
not O
been O
in O
the O
wrong, O
and O
he O
would O
never O
own O
that O
he O
had. O
 O
Concession O
must O
be O
out O
of O
the O
question; O
but O
it O
was O
time O
to O
appear O
to O
forget O
that O
they O
had O
ever O
quarrelled; O
and O
she O
hoped O
it O
might O
rather O
assist O
the O
restoration O
of O
friendship, O
that O
when O
he O
came O
into O
the O
room O
she O
had O
one O
of O
the O
children O
with O
her-- O
the O
youngest, O
a O
nice O
little O
girl O
about O
eight O
months O
old, O
who O
was O
now O
making O
her O
first O
visit O
to O
Hartfield, O
and O
very O
happy O
to O
be O
danced O
about O
in O
her O
aunt's O
arms. O
 O
It O
did O
assist; O
for O
though O
he O
began O
with O
grave O
looks O
and O
short O
questions, O
he O
was O
soon O
led O
on O
to O
talk O
of O
them O
all O
in O
the O
usual O
way, O
and O
to O
take O
the O
child O
out O
of O
her O
arms O
with O
all O
the O
unceremoniousness O
of O
perfect O
amity. O
 O
Emma O
felt O
they O
were O
friends O
again; O
and O
the O
conviction O
giving O
her O
at O
first O
great O
satisfaction, O
and O
then O
a O
little O
sauciness, O
she O
could O
not O
help O
saying, O
as O
he O
was O
admiring O
the O
baby, O
"What O
a O
comfort O
it O
is, O
that O
we O
think O
alike O
about O
our O
nephews O
and O
nieces. O
 O
As O
to O
men O
and O
women, O
our O
opinions O
are O
sometimes O
very O
different; O
but O
with O
regard O
to O
these O
children, O
I O
observe O
we O
never O
disagree." O
"If O
you O
were O
as O
much O
guided O
by O
nature O
in O
your O
estimate O
of O
men O
and O
women, O
and O
as O
little O
under O
the O
power O
of O
fancy O
and O
whim O
in O
your O
dealings O
with O
them, O
as O
you O
are O
where O
these O
children O
are O
concerned, O
we O
might O
always O
think O
alike." O
"To O
be O
sure-- O
our O
discordancies O
must O
always O
arise O
from O
my O
being O
in O
the O
wrong." O
"Yes," O
said O
he, O
smiling-- O
"and O
reason O
good. O
 O
I O
was O
sixteen O
years O
old O
when O
you O
were O
born." O
"A O
material O
difference O
then," O
she O
replied-- O
"and O
no O
doubt O
you O
were O
much O
my O
superior O
in O
judgment O
at O
that O
period O
of O
our O
lives; O
but O
does O
not O
the O
lapse O
of O
one-and-twenty O
years O
bring O
our O
understandings O
a O
good O
deal O
nearer?" O
"Yes O
-- O
a O
good O
deal O
nearer." O
"But O
still, O
not O
near O
enough O
to O
give O
me O
a O
chance O
of O
being O
right, O
if O
we O
think O
differently." O
"I O
have O
still O
the O
advantage O
of O
you O
by O
sixteen O
years' O
experience, O
and O
by O
not O
being O
a O
pretty O
young O
woman O
and O
a O
spoiled O
child. O
 O
Come, O
my O
dear O
Emma, O
let O
us O
be O
friends, O
and O
say O
no O
more O
about O
it. O
 O
Tell O
your O
aunt, O
little O
Emma, O
that O
she O
ought O
to O
set O
you O
a O
better O
example O
than O
to O
be O
renewing O
old O
grievances, O
and O
that O
if O
she O
were O
not O
wrong O
before, O
she O
is O
now." O
"That's O
true," O
she O
cried-- O
"very O
true. O
 O
Little O
Emma, O
grow O
up O
a O
better O
woman O
than O
your O
aunt. O
 O
Be O
infinitely O
cleverer O
and O
not O
half O
so O
conceited. O
 O
Now, O
Mr. O
Knightley, O
a O
word O
or O
two O
more, O
and O
I O
have O
done. O
As O
far O
as O
good O
intentions O
went, O
we O
were O
both O
right, O
and O
I O
must O
say O
that O
no O
effects O
on O
my O
side O
of O
the O
argument O
have O
yet O
proved O
wrong. O
 O
I O
only O
want O
to O
know O
that O
Mr. O
Martin O
is O
not O
very, O
very O
bitterly O
disappointed." O
"A O
man O
cannot O
be O
more O
so," O
was O
his O
short, O
full O
answer. O
"Ah!-- O
Indeed O
I O
am O
very O
sorry.-- O
Come, O
shake O
hands O
with O
me." O
This O
had O
just O
taken O
place O
and O
with O
great O
cordiality, O
when O
John O
Knightley O
made O
his O
appearance, O
and O
"How O
d'ye O
do, O
George?" O
and O
"John, O
how O
are O
you?" O
succeeded O
in O
the O
true O
English O
style, O
burying O
under O
a O
calmness O
that O
seemed O
all O
but O
indifference, O
the O
real O
attachment O
which O
would O
have O
led O
either O
of O
them, O
if O
requisite, O
to O
do O
every O
thing O
for O
the O
good O
of O
the O
other. O
The O
evening O
was O
quiet O
and O
conversable, O
as O
Mr. O
Woodhouse O
declined O
cards O
entirely O
for O
the O
sake O
of O
comfortable O
talk O
with O
his O
dear O
Isabella, O
and O
the O
little O
party O
made O
two O
natural O
divisions; O
on O
one O
side O
he O
and O
his O
daughter; O
on O
the O
other O
the O
two O
Mr. O
Knightleys; O
their O
subjects O
totally O
distinct, O
or O
very O
rarely O
mixing-- O
and O
Emma O
only O
occasionally O
joining O
in O
one O
or O
the O
other. O
The O
brothers O
talked O
of O
their O
own O
concerns O
and O
pursuits, O
but O
principally O
of O
those O
of O
the O
elder, O
whose O
temper O
was O
by O
much O
the O
most O
communicative, O
and O
who O
was O
always O
the O
greater O
talker. O
 O
As O
a O
magistrate, O
he O
had O
generally O
some O
point O
of O
law O
to O
consult O
John O
about, O
or, O
at O
least, O
some O
curious O
anecdote O
to O
give; O
and O
as O
a O
farmer, O
as O
keeping O
in O
hand O
the O
home-farm O
at O
Donwell, O
he O
had O
to O
tell O
what O
every O
field O
was O
to O
bear O
next O
year, O
and O
to O
give O
all O
such O
local O
information O
as O
could O
not O
fail O
of O
being O
interesting O
to O
a O
brother O
whose O
home O
it O
had O
equally O
been O
the O
longest O
part O
of O
his O
life, O
and O
whose O
attachments O
were O
strong. O
 O
The O
plan O
of O
a O
drain, O
the O
change O
of O
a O
fence, O
the O
felling O
of O
a O
tree, O
and O
the O
destination O
of O
every O
acre O
for O
wheat, O
turnips, O
or O
spring O
corn, O
was O
entered O
into O
with O
as O
much O
equality O
of O
interest O
by O
John, O
as O
his O
cooler O
manners O
rendered O
possible; O
and O
if O
his O
willing O
brother O
ever O
left O
him O
any O
thing O
to O
inquire O
about, O
his O
inquiries O
even O
approached O
a O
tone O
of O
eagerness. O
While O
they O
were O
thus O
comfortably O
occupied, O
Mr. O
Woodhouse O
was O
enjoying O
a O
full O
flow O
of O
happy O
regrets O
and O
fearful O
affection O
with O
his O
daughter. O
"My O
poor O
dear O
Isabella," O
said O
he, O
fondly O
taking O
her O
hand, O
and O
interrupting, O
for O
a O
few O
moments, O
her O
busy O
labours O
for O
some O
one O
of O
her O
five O
children-- O
"How O
long O
it O
is, O
how O
terribly O
long O
since O
you O
were O
here! O
And O
how O
tired O
you O
must O
be O
after O
your O
journey! O
 O
You O
must O
go O
to O
bed O
early, O
my O
dear-- O
and O
I O
recommend O
a O
little O
gruel O
to O
you O
before O
you O
go.-- O
You O
and O
I O
will O
have O
a O
nice O
basin O
of O
gruel O
together. O
 O
My O
dear O
Emma, O
suppose O
we O
all O
have O
a O
little O
gruel." O
Emma O
could O
not O
suppose O
any O
such O
thing, O
knowing O
as O
she O
did, O
that O
both O
the O
Mr. O
Knightleys O
were O
as O
unpersuadable O
on O
that O
article O
as O
herself;-- O
and O
two O
basins O
only O
were O
ordered. O
 O
After O
a O
little O
more O
discourse O
in O
praise O
of O
gruel, O
with O
some O
wondering O
at O
its O
not O
being O
taken O
every O
evening O
by O
every O
body, O
he O
proceeded O
to O
say, O
with O
an O
air O
of O
grave O
reflection, O
"It O
was O
an O
awkward O
business, O
my O
dear, O
your O
spending O
the O
autumn O
at O
South O
End O
instead O
of O
coming O
here. O
 O
I O
never O
had O
much O
opinion O
of O
the O
sea O
air." O
"Mr. O
Wingfield O
most O
strenuously O
recommended O
it, O
sir-- O
or O
we O
should O
not O
have O
gone. O
 O
He O
recommended O
it O
for O
all O
the O
children, O
but O
particularly O
for O
the O
weakness O
in O
little O
Bella's O
throat,-- O
both O
sea O
air O
and O
bathing." O
"Ah! O
my O
dear, O
but O
Perry O
had O
many O
doubts O
about O
the O
sea O
doing O
her O
any O
good; O
and O
as O
to O
myself, O
I O
have O
been O
long O
perfectly O
convinced, O
though O
perhaps O
I O
never O
told O
you O
so O
before, O
that O
the O
sea O
is O
very O
rarely O
of O
use O
to O
any O
body. O
 O
I O
am O
sure O
it O
almost O
killed O
me O
once." O
"Come, O
come," O
cried O
Emma, O
feeling O
this O
to O
be O
an O
unsafe O
subject, O
"I O
must O
beg O
you O
not O
to O
talk O
of O
the O
sea. O
 O
It O
makes O
me O
envious O
and O
miserable; O
-- O
I O
who O
have O
never O
seen O
it! O
 O
South O
End O
is O
prohibited, O
if O
you O
please. O
 O
My O
dear O
Isabella, O
I O
have O
not O
heard O
you O
make O
one O
inquiry O
about O
Mr. O
Perry O
yet; O
and O
he O
never O
forgets O
you." O
"Oh! O
good O
Mr. O
Perry-- O
how O
is O
he, O
sir?" O
"Why, O
pretty O
well; O
but O
not O
quite O
well. O
 O
Poor O
Perry O
is O
bilious, O
and O
he O
has O
not O
time O
to O
take O
care O
of O
himself-- O
he O
tells O
me O
he O
has O
not O
time O
to O
take O
care O
of O
himself-- O
which O
is O
very O
sad-- O
but O
he O
is O
always O
wanted O
all O
round O
the O
country. O
 O
I O
suppose O
there O
is O
not O
a O
man O
in O
such O
practice O
anywhere. O
 O
But O
then O
there O
is O
not O
so O
clever O
a O
man O
any O
where." O
"And O
Mrs. O
Perry O
and O
the O
children, O
how O
are O
they? O
do O
the O
children O
grow? O
I O
have O
a O
great O
regard O
for O
Mr. O
Perry. O
 O
I O
hope O
he O
will O
be O
calling O
soon. O
He O
will O
be O
so O
pleased O
to O
see O
my O
little O
ones." O
"I O
hope O
he O
will O
be O
here O
to-morrow, O
for O
I O
have O
a O
question O
or O
two O
to O
ask O
him O
about O
myself O
of O
some O
consequence. O
 O
And, O
my O
dear, O
whenever O
he O
comes, O
you O
had O
better O
let O
him O
look O
at O
little O
Bella's O
throat." O
"Oh! O
my O
dear O
sir, O
her O
throat O
is O
so O
much O
better O
that O
I O
have O
hardly O
any O
uneasiness O
about O
it. O
 O
Either O
bathing O
has O
been O
of O
the O
greatest O
service O
to O
her, O
or O
else O
it O
is O
to O
be O
attributed O
to O
an O
excellent O
embrocation O
of O
Mr. O
Wingfield's, O
which O
we O
have O
been O
applying O
at O
times O
ever O
since O
August." O
"It O
is O
not O
very O
likely, O
my O
dear, O
that O
bathing O
should O
have O
been O
of O
use O
to O
her-- O
and O
if O
I O
had O
known O
you O
were O
wanting O
an O
embrocation, O
I O
would O
have O
spoken O
to-- O
 O
You O
seem O
to O
me O
to O
have O
forgotten O
Mrs. O
and O
Miss O
Bates," O
said O
Emma, O
"I O
have O
not O
heard O
one O
inquiry O
after O
them." O
"Oh! O
the O
good O
Bateses O
-- O
I O
am O
quite O
ashamed O
of O
myself-- O
but O
you O
mention O
them O
in O
most O
of O
your O
letters. O
 O
I O
hope O
they O
are O
quite O
well. O
 O
Good O
old O
Mrs. O
Bates O
-- O
I O
will O
call O
upon O
her O
to-morrow, O
and O
take O
my O
children.-- O
They O
are O
always O
so O
pleased O
to O
see O
my O
children.-- O
And O
that O
excellent O
Miss O
Bates!-- O
such O
thorough O
worthy O
people!-- O
How O
are O
they, O
sir?" O
"Why, O
pretty O
well, O
my O
dear, O
upon O
the O
whole. O
 O
But O
poor O
Mrs. O
Bates O
had O
a O
bad O
cold O
about O
a O
month O
ago." O
"How O
sorry O
I O
am! O
 O
But O
colds O
were O
never O
so O
prevalent O
as O
they O
have O
been O
this O
autumn. O
 O
Mr. O
Wingfield O
told O
me O
that O
he O
has O
never O
known O
them O
more O
general O
or O
heavy-- O
except O
when O
it O
has O
been O
quite O
an O
influenza." O
"That O
has O
been O
a O
good O
deal O
the O
case, O
my O
dear; O
but O
not O
to O
the O
degree O
you O
mention. O
 O
Perry O
says O
that O
colds O
have O
been O
very O
general, O
but O
not O
so O
heavy O
as O
he O
has O
very O
often O
known O
them O
in O
November. O
 O
Perry O
does O
not O
call O
it O
altogether O
a O
sickly O
season." O
"No, O
I O
do O
not O
know O
that O
Mr. O
Wingfield O
considers O
it O
very O
sickly O
except-- O
 O
Ah! O
my O
poor O
dear O
child, O
the O
truth O
is, O
that O
in O
London O
it O
is O
always O
a O
sickly O
season. O
 O
Nobody O
is O
healthy O
in O
London, O
nobody O
can O
be. O
 O
It O
is O
a O
dreadful O
thing O
to O
have O
you O
forced O
to O
live O
there! O
so O
far O
off!-- O
and O
the O
air O
so O
bad!" O
"No, O
indeed-- O
we O
are O
not O
at O
all O
in O
a O
bad O
air. O
 O
Our O
part O
of O
London O
is O
very O
superior O
to O
most O
others!-- O
You O
must O
not O
confound O
us O
with O
London O
in O
general, O
my O
dear O
sir. O
 O
The O
neighbourhood O
of O
Brunswick O
Square O
is O
very O
different O
from O
almost O
all O
the O
rest. O
 O
We O
are O
so O
very O
airy! O
 O
I O
should O
be O
unwilling, O
I O
own, O
to O
live O
in O
any O
other O
part O
of O
the O
town;-- O
there O
is O
hardly O
any O
other O
that O
I O
could O
be O
satisfied O
to O
have O
my O
children O
in: O
 O
but O
we O
are O
so O
remarkably O
airy!-- O
Mr. O
Wingfield O
thinks O
the O
vicinity O
of O
Brunswick O
Square O
decidedly O
the O
most O
favourable O
as O
to O
air." O
"Ah! O
my O
dear, O
it O
is O
not O
like O
Hartfield. O
 O
You O
make O
the O
best O
of O
it-- O
but O
after O
you O
have O
been O
a O
week O
at O
Hartfield, O
you O
are O
all O
of O
you O
different O
creatures; O
you O
do O
not O
look O
like O
the O
same. O
 O
Now O
I O
cannot O
say, O
that O
I O
think O
you O
are O
any O
of O
you O
looking O
well O
at O
present." O
"I O
am O
sorry O
to O
hear O
you O
say O
so, O
sir; O
but O
I O
assure O
you, O
excepting O
those O
little O
nervous O
head-aches O
and O
palpitations O
which O
I O
am O
never O
entirely O
free O
from O
anywhere, O
I O
am O
quite O
well O
myself; O
and O
if O
the O
children O
were O
rather O
pale O
before O
they O
went O
to O
bed, O
it O
was O
only O
because O
they O
were O
a O
little O
more O
tired O
than O
usual, O
from O
their O
journey O
and O
the O
happiness O
of O
coming. O
 O
I O
hope O
you O
will O
think O
better O
of O
their O
looks O
to-morrow; O
for O
I O
assure O
you O
Mr. O
Wingfield O
told O
me, O
that O
he O
did O
not O
believe O
he O
had O
ever O
sent O
us O
off O
altogether, O
in O
such O
good O
case. O
 O
I O
trust, O
at O
least, O
that O
you O
do O
not O
think O
Mr. O
Knightley O
looking O
ill," O
turning O
her O
eyes O
with O
affectionate O
anxiety O
towards O
her O
husband. O
"Middling, O
my O
dear; O
I O
cannot O
compliment O
you. O
 O
I O
think O
Mr. O
John O
Knightley O
very O
far O
from O
looking O
well." O
"What O
is O
the O
matter, O
sir?-- O
Did O
you O
speak O
to O
me?" O
cried O
Mr. O
John O
Knightley, O
hearing O
his O
own O
name. O
"I O
am O
sorry O
to O
find, O
my O
love, O
that O
my O
father O
does O
not O
think O
you O
looking O
well-- O
but O
I O
hope O
it O
is O
only O
from O
being O
a O
little O
fatigued. O
 O
I O
could O
have O
wished, O
however, O
as O
you O
know, O
that O
you O
had O
seen O
Mr. O
Wingfield O
before O
you O
left O
home." O
"My O
dear O
Isabella,"-- O
exclaimed O
he O
hastily-- O
"pray O
do O
not O
concern O
yourself O
about O
my O
looks. O
 O
Be O
satisfied O
with O
doctoring O
and O
coddling O
yourself O
and O
the O
children, O
and O
let O
me O
look O
as O
I O
chuse." O
"I O
did O
not O
thoroughly O
understand O
what O
you O
were O
telling O
your O
brother," O
cried O
Emma, O
"about O
your O
friend O
Mr. O
Graham's O
intending O
to O
have O
a O
bailiff O
from O
Scotland, O
to O
look O
after O
his O
new O
estate. O
 O
What O
will O
it O
answer? O
Will O
not O
the O
old O
prejudice O
be O
too O
strong?" O
And O
she O
talked O
in O
this O
way O
so O
long O
and O
successfully O
that, O
when O
forced O
to O
give O
her O
attention O
again O
to O
her O
father O
and O
sister, O
she O
had O
nothing O
worse O
to O
hear O
than O
Isabella's O
kind O
inquiry O
after O
Jane O
Fairfax; O
and O
Jane O
Fairfax, O
though O
no O
great O
favourite O
with O
her O
in O
general, O
she O
was O
at O
that O
moment O
very O
happy O
to O
assist O
in O
praising. O
"That O
sweet, O
amiable O
Jane O
Fairfax!" O
said O
Mrs. O
John O
Knightley.-- O
"It O
is O
so O
long O
since O
I O
have O
seen O
her, O
except O
now O
and O
then O
for O
a O
moment O
accidentally O
in O
town! O
 O
What O
happiness O
it O
must O
be O
to O
her O
good O
old O
grandmother O
and O
excellent O
aunt, O
when O
she O
comes O
to O
visit O
them! O
 O
I O
always O
regret O
excessively O
on O
dear O
Emma's O
account O
that O
she O
cannot O
be O
more O
at O
Highbury; O
but O
now O
their O
daughter O
is O
married, O
I O
suppose O
Colonel O
and O
Mrs. O
Campbell O
will O
not O
be O
able O
to O
part O
with O
her O
at O
all. O
 O
She O
would O
be O
such O
a O
delightful O
companion O
for O
Emma." O
Mr. O
Woodhouse O
agreed O
to O
it O
all, O
but O
added, O
"Our O
little O
friend O
Harriet O
Smith, O
however, O
is O
just O
such O
another O
pretty O
kind O
of O
young O
person. O
 O
You O
will O
like O
Harriet. O
 O
Emma O
could O
not O
have O
a O
better O
companion O
than O
Harriet." O
"I O
am O
most O
happy O
to O
hear O
it-- O
but O
only O
Jane O
Fairfax O
one O
knows O
to O
be O
so O
very O
accomplished O
and O
superior!-- O
and O
exactly O
Emma's O
age." O
This O
topic O
was O
discussed O
very O
happily, O
and O
others O
succeeded O
of O
similar O
moment, O
and O
passed O
away O
with O
similar O
harmony; O
but O
the O
evening O
did O
not O
close O
without O
a O
little O
return O
of O
agitation. O
 O
The O
gruel O
came O
and O
supplied O
a O
great O
deal O
to O
be O
said-- O
much O
praise O
and O
many O
comments-- O
undoubting O
decision O
of O
its O
wholesomeness O
for O
every O
constitution, O
and O
pretty O
severe O
Philippics O
upon O
the O
many O
houses O
where O
it O
was O
never O
met O
with O
tolerable;-- O
but, O
unfortunately, O
among O
the O
failures O
which O
the O
daughter O
had O
to O
instance, O
the O
most O
recent, O
and O
therefore O
most O
prominent, O
was O
in O
her O
own O
cook O
at O
South O
End, O
a O
young O
woman O
hired O
for O
the O
time, O
who O
never O
had O
been O
able O
to O
understand O
what O
she O
meant O
by O
a O
basin O
of O
nice O
smooth O
gruel, O
thin, O
but O
not O
too O
thin. O
 O
Often O
as O
she O
had O
wished O
for O
and O
ordered O
it, O
she O
had O
never O
been O
able O
to O
get O
any O
thing O
tolerable. O
 O
Here O
was O
a O
dangerous O
opening. O
"Ah!" O
said O
Mr. O
Woodhouse, O
shaking O
his O
head O
and O
fixing O
his O
eyes O
on O
her O
with O
tender O
concern.-- O
The O
ejaculation O
in O
Emma's O
ear O
expressed, O
"Ah! O
there O
is O
no O
end O
of O
the O
sad O
consequences O
of O
your O
going O
to O
South O
End. O
 O
It O
does O
not O
bear O
talking O
of." O
And O
for O
a O
little O
while O
she O
hoped O
he O
would O
not O
talk O
of O
it, O
and O
that O
a O
silent O
rumination O
might O
suffice O
to O
restore O
him O
to O
the O
relish O
of O
his O
own O
smooth O
gruel. O
 O
After O
an O
interval O
of O
some O
minutes, O
however, O
he O
began O
with, O
"I O
shall O
always O
be O
very O
sorry O
that O
you O
went O
to O
the O
sea O
this O
autumn, O
instead O
of O
coming O
here." O
"But O
why O
should O
you O
be O
sorry, O
sir? O
-- O
I O
assure O
you, O
it O
did O
the O
children O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
good." O
"And, O
moreover, O
if O
you O
must O
go O
to O
the O
sea, O
it O
had O
better O
not O
have O
been O
to O
South O
End. O
 O
South O
End O
is O
an O
unhealthy O
place. O
 O
Perry O
was O
surprized O
to O
hear O
you O
had O
fixed O
upon O
South O
End." O
"I O
know O
there O
is O
such O
an O
idea O
with O
many O
people, O
but O
indeed O
it O
is O
quite O
a O
mistake, O
sir.-- O
We O
all O
had O
our O
health O
perfectly O
well O
there, O
never O
found O
the O
least O
inconvenience O
from O
the O
mud; O
and O
Mr. O
Wingfield O
says O
it O
is O
entirely O
a O
mistake O
to O
suppose O
the O
place O
unhealthy; O
and O
I O
am O
sure O
he O
may O
be O
depended O
on, O
for O
he O
thoroughly O
understands O
the O
nature O
of O
the O
air, O
and O
his O
own O
brother O
and O
family O
have O
been O
there O
repeatedly." O
"You O
should O
have O
gone O
to O
Cromer, O
my O
dear, O
if O
you O
went O
anywhere.-- O
Perry O
was O
a O
week O
at O
Cromer O
once, O
and O
he O
holds O
it O
to O
be O
the O
best O
of O
all O
the O
sea-bathing O
places. O
 O
A O
fine O
open O
sea, O
he O
says, O
and O
very O
pure O
air. O
 O
And, O
by O
what O
I O
understand, O
you O
might O
have O
had O
lodgings O
there O
quite O
away O
from O
the O
sea O
-- O
a O
quarter O
of O
a O
mile O
off-- O
very O
comfortable. O
 O
You O
should O
have O
consulted O
Perry." O
"But, O
my O
dear O
sir, O
the O
difference O
of O
the O
journey;-- O
only O
consider O
how O
great O
it O
would O
have O
been.-- O
An O
hundred O
miles, O
perhaps, O
instead O
of O
forty." O
"Ah! O
my O
dear, O
as O
Perry O
says, O
where O
health O
is O
at O
stake, O
nothing O
else O
should O
be O
considered; O
and O
if O
one O
is O
to O
travel, O
there O
is O
not O
much O
to O
chuse O
between O
forty O
miles O
and O
an O
hundred.-- O
Better O
not O
move O
at O
all, O
better O
stay O
in O
London O
altogether O
than O
travel O
forty O
miles O
to O
get O
into O
a O
worse O
air. O
 O
This O
is O
just O
what O
Perry O
said. O
 O
It O
seemed O
to O
him O
a O
very O
ill-judged O
measure." O
Emma's O
attempts O
to O
stop O
her O
father O
had O
been O
vain; O
and O
when O
he O
had O
reached O
such O
a O
point O
as O
this, O
she O
could O
not O
wonder O
at O
her O
brother-in-law's O
breaking O
out. O
"Mr. O
Perry," O
said O
he, O
in O
a O
voice O
of O
very O
strong O
displeasure, O
"would O
do O
as O
well O
to O
keep O
his O
opinion O
till O
it O
is O
asked O
for. O
 O
Why O
does O
he O
make O
it O
any O
business O
of O
his, O
to O
wonder O
at O
what O
I O
do?-- O
at O
my O
taking O
my O
family O
to O
one O
part O
of O
the O
coast O
or O
another? O
-- O
I O
may O
be O
allowed, O
I O
hope, O
the O
use O
of O
my O
judgment O
as O
well O
as O
Mr. O
Perry.-- O
I O
want O
his O
directions O
no O
more O
than O
his O
drugs." O
He O
paused-- O
and O
growing O
cooler O
in O
a O
moment, O
added, O
with O
only O
sarcastic O
dryness, O
"If O
Mr. O
Perry O
can O
tell O
me O
how O
to O
convey O
a O
wife O
and O
five O
children O
a O
distance O
of O
an O
hundred O
and O
thirty O
miles O
with O
no O
greater O
expense O
or O
inconvenience O
than O
a O
distance O
of O
forty, O
I O
should O
be O
as O
willing O
to O
prefer O
Cromer O
to O
South O
End O
as O
he O
could O
himself." O
"True, O
true," O
cried O
Mr. O
Knightley, O
with O
most O
ready O
interposition-- O
"very O
true. O
 O
That's O
a O
consideration O
indeed.-- O
But O
John, O
as O
to O
what O
I O
was O
telling O
you O
of O
my O
idea O
of O
moving O
the O
path O
to O
Langham, O
of O
turning O
it O
more O
to O
the O
right O
that O
it O
may O
not O
cut O
through O
the O
home O
meadows, O
I O
cannot O
conceive O
any O
difficulty. O
 O
I O
should O
not O
attempt O
it, O
if O
it O
were O
to O
be O
the O
means O
of O
inconvenience O
to O
the O
Highbury O
people, O
but O
if O
you O
call O
to O
mind O
exactly O
the O
present O
line O
of O
the O
path. O
. O
. O
. O
 O
The O
only O
way O
of O
proving O
it, O
however, O
will O
be O
to O
turn O
to O
our O
maps. O
 O
I O
shall O
see O
you O
at O
the O
Abbey O
to-morrow O
morning O
I O
hope, O
and O
then O
we O
will O
look O
them O
over, O
and O
you O
shall O
give O
me O
your O
opinion." O
Mr. O
Woodhouse O
was O
rather O
agitated O
by O
such O
harsh O
reflections O
on O
his O
friend O
Perry, O
to O
whom O
he O
had, O
in O
fact, O
though O
unconsciously, O
been O
attributing O
many O
of O
his O
own O
feelings O
and O
expressions;-- O
but O
the O
soothing O
attentions O
of O
his O
daughters O
gradually O
removed O
the O
present O
evil, O
and O
the O
immediate O
alertness O
of O
one O
brother, O
and O
better O
recollections O
of O
the O
other, O
prevented O
any O
renewal O
of O
it. O
CHAPTER O
XIII O
There O
could O
hardly O
be O
a O
happier O
creature O
in O
the O
world O
than O
Mrs. O
John O
Knightley, O
in O
this O
short O
visit O
to O
Hartfield, O
going O
about O
every O
morning O
among O
her O
old O
acquaintance O
with O
her O
five O
children, O
and O
talking O
over O
what O
she O
had O
done O
every O
evening O
with O
her O
father O
and O
sister. O
 O
She O
had O
nothing O
to O
wish O
otherwise, O
but O
that O
the O
days O
did O
not O
pass O
so O
swiftly. O
It O
was O
a O
delightful O
visit;-- O
perfect, O
in O
being O
much O
too O
short. O
In O
general O
their O
evenings O
were O
less O
engaged O
with O
friends O
than O
their O
mornings; O
but O
one O
complete O
dinner O
engagement, O
and O
out O
of O
the O
house O
too, O
there O
was O
no O
avoiding, O
though O
at O
Christmas. O
 O
Mr. O
Weston O
would O
take O
no O
denial; O
they O
must O
all O
dine O
at O
Randalls O
one O
day;-- O
even O
Mr. O
Woodhouse O
was O
persuaded O
to O
think O
it O
a O
possible O
thing O
in O
preference O
to O
a O
division O
of O
the O
party. O
How O
they O
were O
all O
to O
be O
conveyed, O
he O
would O
have O
made O
a O
difficulty O
if O
he O
could, O
but O
as O
his O
son O
and O
daughter's O
carriage O
and O
horses O
were O
actually O
at O
Hartfield, O
he O
was O
not O
able O
to O
make O
more O
than O
a O
simple O
question O
on O
that O
head; O
it O
hardly O
amounted O
to O
a O
doubt; O
nor O
did O
it O
occupy O
Emma O
long O
to O
convince O
him O
that O
they O
might O
in O
one O
of O
the O
carriages O
find O
room O
for O
Harriet O
also. O
Harriet, O
Mr. O
Elton, O
and O
Mr. O
Knightley, O
their O
own O
especial O
set, O
were O
the O
only O
persons O
invited O
to O
meet O
them;-- O
the O
hours O
were O
to O
be O
early, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
numbers O
few; O
Mr. O
Woodhouse's O
habits O
and O
inclination O
being O
consulted O
in O
every O
thing. O
The O
evening O
before O
this O
great O
event O
(for O
it O
was O
a O
very O
great O
event O
that O
Mr. O
Woodhouse O
should O
dine O
out, O
on O
the O
24th O
of O
December) O
had O
been O
spent O
by O
Harriet O
at O
Hartfield, O
and O
she O
had O
gone O
home O
so O
much O
indisposed O
with O
a O
cold, O
that, O
but O
for O
her O
own O
earnest O
wish O
of O
being O
nursed O
by O
Mrs. O
Goddard, O
Emma O
could O
not O
have O
allowed O
her O
to O
leave O
the O
house. O
 O
Emma O
called O
on O
her O
the O
next O
day, O
and O
found O
her O
doom O
already O
signed O
with O
regard O
to O
Randalls. O
 O
She O
was O
very O
feverish O
and O
had O
a O
bad O
sore O
throat: O
Mrs. O
Goddard O
was O
full O
of O
care O
and O
affection, O
Mr. O
Perry O
was O
talked O
of, O
and O
Harriet O
herself O
was O
too O
ill O
and O
low O
to O
resist O
the O
authority O
which O
excluded O
her O
from O
this O
delightful O
engagement, O
though O
she O
could O
not O
speak O
of O
her O
loss O
without O
many O
tears. O
Emma O
sat O
with O
her O
as O
long O
as O
she O
could, O
to O
attend O
her O
in O
Mrs. O
Goddard's O
unavoidable O
absences, O
and O
raise O
her O
spirits O
by O
representing O
how O
much O
Mr. O
Elton's O
would O
be O
depressed O
when O
he O
knew O
her O
state; O
and O
left O
her O
at O
last O
tolerably O
comfortable, O
in O
the O
sweet O
dependence O
of O
his O
having O
a O
most O
comfortless O
visit, O
and O
of O
their O
all O
missing O
her O
very O
much. O
 O
She O
had O
not O
advanced O
many O
yards O
from O
Mrs. O
Goddard's O
door, O
when O
she O
was O
met O
by O
Mr. O
Elton O
himself, O
evidently O
coming O
towards O
it, O
and O
as O
they O
walked O
on O
slowly O
together O
in O
conversation O
about O
the O
invalid-- O
of O
whom O
he, O
on O
the O
rumour O
of O
considerable O
illness, O
had O
been O
going O
to O
inquire, O
that O
he O
might O
carry O
some O
report O
of O
her O
to O
Hartfield-- O
they O
were O
overtaken O
by O
Mr. O
John O
Knightley O
returning O
from O
the O
daily O
visit O
to O
Donwell, O
with O
his O
two O
eldest O
boys, O
whose O
healthy, O
glowing O
faces O
shewed O
all O
the O
benefit O
of O
a O
country O
run, O
and O
seemed O
to O
ensure O
a O
quick O
despatch O
of O
the O
roast O
mutton O
and O
rice O
pudding O
they O
were O
hastening O
home O
for. O
 O
They O
joined O
company O
and O
proceeded O
together. O
 O
Emma O
was O
just O
describing O
the O
nature O
of O
her O
friend's O
complaint;-- O
"a O
throat O
very O
much O
inflamed, O
with O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
heat O
about O
her, O
a O
quick, O
low O
pulse, O
&c. O
 O
and O
she O
was O
sorry O
to O
find O
from O
Mrs. O
Goddard O
that O
Harriet O
was O
liable O
to O
very O
bad O
sore-throats, O
and O
had O
often O
alarmed O
her O
with O
them." O
Mr. O
Elton O
looked O
all O
alarm O
on O
the O
occasion, O
as O
he O
exclaimed, O
"A O
sore-throat! O
-- O
I O
hope O
not O
infectious. O
 O
I O
hope O
not O
of O
a O
putrid O
infectious O
sort. O
 O
Has O
Perry O
seen O
her? O
 O
Indeed O
you O
should O
take O
care O
of O
yourself O
as O
well O
as O
of O
your O
friend. O
 O
Let O
me O
entreat O
you O
to O
run O
no O
risks. O
 O
Why O
does O
not O
Perry O
see O
her?" O
Emma, O
who O
was O
not O
really O
at O
all O
frightened O
herself, O
tranquillised O
this O
excess O
of O
apprehension O
by O
assurances O
of O
Mrs. O
Goddard's O
experience O
and O
care; O
but O
as O
there O
must O
still O
remain O
a O
degree O
of O
uneasiness O
which O
she O
could O
not O
wish O
to O
reason O
away, O
which O
she O
would O
rather O
feed O
and O
assist O
than O
not, O
she O
added O
soon O
afterwards-- O
as O
if O
quite O
another O
subject, O
"It O
is O
so O
cold, O
so O
very O
cold-- O
and O
looks O
and O
feels O
so O
very O
much O
like O
snow, O
that O
if O
it O
were O
to O
any O
other O
place O
or O
with O
any O
other O
party, O
I O
should O
really O
try O
not O
to O
go O
out O
to-day-- O
and O
dissuade O
my O
father O
from O
venturing; O
but O
as O
he O
has O
made O
up O
his O
mind, O
and O
does O
not O
seem O
to O
feel O
the O
cold O
himself, O
I O
do O
not O
like O
to O
interfere, O
as O
I O
know O
it O
would O
be O
so O
great O
a O
disappointment O
to O
Mr. O
and O
Mrs. O
Weston. O
 O
But, O
upon O
my O
word, O
Mr. O
Elton, O
in O
your O
case, O
I O
should O
certainly O
excuse O
myself. O
 O
You O
appear O
to O
me O
a O
little O
hoarse O
already, O
and O
when O
you O
consider O
what O
demand O
of O
voice O
and O
what O
fatigues O
to-morrow O
will O
bring, O
I O
think O
it O
would O
be O
no O
more O
than O
common O
prudence O
to O
stay O
at O
home O
and O
take O
care O
of O
yourself O
to-night." O
Mr. O
Elton O
looked O
as O
if O
he O
did O
not O
very O
well O
know O
what O
answer O
to O
make; O
which O
was O
exactly O
the O
case; O
for O
though O
very O
much O
gratified O
by O
the O
kind O
care O
of O
such O
a O
fair O
lady, O
and O
not O
liking O
to O
resist O
any O
advice O
of O
her's, O
he O
had O
not O
really O
the O
least O
inclination O
to O
give O
up O
the O
visit;-- O
but O
Emma, O
too O
eager O
and O
busy O
in O
her O
own O
previous O
conceptions O
and O
views O
to O
hear O
him O
impartially, O
or O
see O
him O
with O
clear O
vision, O
was O
very O
well O
satisfied O
with O
his O
muttering O
acknowledgment O
of O
its O
being O
"very O
cold, O
certainly O
very O
cold," O
and O
walked O
on, O
rejoicing O
in O
having O
extricated O
him O
from O
Randalls, O
and O
secured O
him O
the O
power O
of O
sending O
to O
inquire O
after O
Harriet O
every O
hour O
of O
the O
evening. O
"You O
do O
quite O
right," O
said O
she;-- O
"we O
will O
make O
your O
apologies O
to O
Mr. O
and O
Mrs. O
Weston." O
But O
hardly O
had O
she O
so O
spoken, O
when O
she O
found O
her O
brother O
was O
civilly O
offering O
a O
seat O
in O
his O
carriage, O
if O
the O
weather O
were O
Mr. O
Elton's O
only O
objection, O
and O
Mr. O
Elton O
actually O
accepting O
the O
offer O
with O
much O
prompt O
satisfaction. O
 O
It O
was O
a O
done O
thing; O
Mr. O
Elton O
was O
to O
go, O
and O
never O
had O
his O
broad O
handsome O
face O
expressed O
more O
pleasure O
than O
at O
this O
moment; O
never O
had O
his O
smile O
been O
stronger, O
nor O
his O
eyes O
more O
exulting O
than O
when O
he O
next O
looked O
at O
her. O
"Well," O
said O
she O
to O
herself, O
"this O
is O
most O
strange!-- O
After O
I O
had O
got O
him O
off O
so O
well, O
to O
chuse O
to O
go O
into O
company, O
and O
leave O
Harriet O
ill O
behind!-- O
Most O
strange O
indeed!-- O
But O
there O
is, O
I O
believe, O
in O
many O
men, O
especially O
single O
men, O
such O
an O
inclination-- O
such O
a O
passion O
for O
dining O
out O
-- O
a O
dinner O
engagement O
is O
so O
high O
in O
the O
class O
of O
their O
pleasures, O
their O
employments, O
their O
dignities, O
almost O
their O
duties, O
that O
any O
thing O
gives O
way O
to O
it-- O
and O
this O
must O
be O
the O
case O
with O
Mr. O
Elton; O
a O
most O
valuable, O
amiable, O
pleasing O
young O
man O
undoubtedly, O
and O
very O
much O
in O
love O
with O
Harriet; O
but O
still, O
he O
cannot O
refuse O
an O
invitation, O
he O
must O
dine O
out O
wherever O
he O
is O
asked. O
 O
What O
a O
strange O
thing O
love O
is! O
he O
can O
see O
ready O
wit O
in O
Harriet, O
but O
will O
not O
dine O
alone O
for O
her." O
Soon O
afterwards O
Mr. O
Elton O
quitted O
them, O
and O
she O
could O
not O
but O
do O
him O
the O
justice O
of O
feeling O
that O
there O
was O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
sentiment O
in O
his O
manner O
of O
naming O
Harriet O
at O
parting; O
in O
the O
tone O
of O
his O
voice O
while O
assuring O
her O
that O
he O
should O
call O
at O
Mrs. O
Goddard's O
for O
news O
of O
her O
fair O
friend, O
the O
last O
thing O
before O
he O
prepared O
for O
the O
happiness O
of O
meeting O
her O
again, O
when O
he O
hoped O
to O
be O
able O
to O
give O
a O
better O
report; O
and O
he O
sighed O
and O
smiled O
himself O
off O
in O
a O
way O
that O
left O
the O
balance O
of O
approbation O
much O
in O
his O
favour. O
After O
a O
few O
minutes O
of O
entire O
silence O
between O
them, O
John O
Knightley O
began O
with-- O
"I O
never O
in O
my O
life O
saw O
a O
man O
more O
intent O
on O
being O
agreeable O
than O
Mr. O
Elton. O
 O
It O
is O
downright O
labour O
to O
him O
where O
ladies O
are O
concerned. O
 O
With O
men O
he O
can O
be O
rational O
and O
unaffected, O
but O
when O
he O
has O
ladies O
to O
please, O
every O
feature O
works." O
"Mr. O
Elton's O
manners O
are O
not O
perfect," O
replied O
Emma; O
"but O
where O
there O
is O
a O
wish O
to O
please, O
one O
ought O
to O
overlook, O
and O
one O
does O
overlook O
a O
great O
deal. O
 O
Where O
a O
man O
does O
his O
best O
with O
only O
moderate O
powers, O
he O
will O
have O
the O
advantage O
over O
negligent O
superiority. O
 O
There O
is O
such O
perfect O
good-temper O
and O
good-will O
in O
Mr. O
Elton O
as O
one O
cannot O
but O
value." O
"Yes," O
said O
Mr. O
John O
Knightley O
presently, O
with O
some O
slyness, O
"he O
seems O
to O
have O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
good-will O
towards O
you." O
"Me!" O
she O
replied O
with O
a O
smile O
of O
astonishment, O
"are O
you O
imagining O
me O
to O
be O
Mr. O
Elton's O
object?" O
"Such O
an O
imagination O
has O
crossed O
me, O
I O
own, O
Emma; O
and O
if O
it O
never O
occurred O
to O
you O
before, O
you O
may O
as O
well O
take O
it O
into O
consideration O
now." O
"Mr. O
Elton O
in O
love O
with O
me!-- O
What O
an O
idea!" O
"I O
do O
not O
say O
it O
is O
so; O
but O
you O
will O
do O
well O
to O
consider O
whether O
it O
is O
so O
or O
not, O
and O
to O
regulate O
your O
behaviour O
accordingly. O
 O
I O
think O
your O
manners O
to O
him O
encouraging. O
 O
I O
speak O
as O
a O
friend, O
Emma. O
 O
You O
had O
better O
look O
about O
you, O
and O
ascertain O
what O
you O
do, O
and O
what O
you O
mean O
to O
do." O
"I O
thank O
you; O
but O
I O
assure O
you O
you O
are O
quite O
mistaken. O
 O
Mr. O
Elton O
and O
I O
are O
very O
good O
friends, O
and O
nothing O
more;" O
and O
she O
walked O
on, O
amusing O
herself O
in O
the O
consideration O
of O
the O
blunders O
which O
often O
arise O
from O
a O
partial O
knowledge O
of O
circumstances, O
of O
the O
mistakes O
which O
people O
of O
high O
pretensions O
to O
judgment O
are O
for O
ever O
falling O
into; O
and O
not O
very O
well O
pleased O
with O
her O
brother O
for O
imagining O
her O
blind O
and O
ignorant, O
and O
in O
want O
of O
counsel. O
 O
He O
said O
no O
more. O
Mr. O
Woodhouse O
had O
so O
completely O
made O
up O
his O
mind O
to O
the O
visit, O
that O
in O
spite O
of O
the O
increasing O
coldness, O
he O
seemed O
to O
have O
no O
idea O
of O
shrinking O
from O
it, O
and O
set O
forward O
at O
last O
most O
punctually O
with O
his O
eldest O
daughter O
in O
his O
own O
carriage, O
with O
less O
apparent O
consciousness O
of O
the O
weather O
than O
either O
of O
the O
others; O
too O
full O
of O
the O
wonder O
of O
his O
own O
going, O
and O
the O
pleasure O
it O
was O
to O
afford O
at O
Randalls O
to O
see O
that O
it O
was O
cold, O
and O
too O
well O
wrapt O
up O
to O
feel O
it. O
 O
The O
cold, O
however, O
was O
severe; O
and O
by O
the O
time O
the O
second O
carriage O
was O
in O
motion, O
a O
few O
flakes O
of O
snow O
were O
finding O
their O
way O
down, O
and O
the O
sky O
had O
the O
appearance O
of O
being O
so O
overcharged O
as O
to O
want O
only O
a O
milder O
air O
to O
produce O
a O
very O
white O
world O
in O
a O
very O
short O
time. O
Emma O
soon O
saw O
that O
her O
companion O
was O
not O
in O
the O
happiest O
humour. O
 O
The O
preparing O
and O
the O
going O
abroad O
in O
such O
weather, O
with O
the O
sacrifice O
of O
his O
children O
after O
dinner, O
were O
evils, O
were O
disagreeables O
at O
least, O
which O
Mr. O
John O
Knightley O
did O
not O
by O
any O
means O
like; O
he O
anticipated O
nothing O
in O
the O
visit O
that O
could O
be O
at O
all O
worth O
the O
purchase; O
and O
the O
whole O
of O
their O
drive O
to O
the O
vicarage O
was O
spent O
by O
him O
in O
expressing O
his O
discontent. O
"A O
man," O
said O
he, O
"must O
have O
a O
very O
good O
opinion O
of O
himself O
when O
he O
asks O
people O
to O
leave O
their O
own O
fireside, O
and O
encounter O
such O
a O
day O
as O
this, O
for O
the O
sake O
of O
coming O
to O
see O
him. O
 O
He O
must O
think O
himself O
a O
most O
agreeable O
fellow; O
I O
could O
not O
do O
such O
a O
thing. O
 O
It O
is O
the O
greatest O
absurdity-- O
Actually O
snowing O
at O
this O
moment!-- O
The O
folly O
of O
not O
allowing O
people O
to O
be O
comfortable O
at O
home-- O
and O
the O
folly O
of O
people's O
not O
staying O
comfortably O
at O
home O
when O
they O
can! O
 O
If O
we O
were O
obliged O
to O
go O
out O
such O
an O
evening O
as O
this, O
by O
any O
call O
of O
duty O
or O
business, O
what O
a O
hardship O
we O
should O
deem O
it;-- O
and O
here O
are O
we, O
probably O
with O
rather O
thinner O
clothing O
than O
usual, O
setting O
forward O
voluntarily, O
without O
excuse, O
in O
defiance O
of O
the O
voice O
of O
nature, O
which O
tells O
man, O
in O
every O
thing O
given O
to O
his O
view O
or O
his O
feelings, O
to O
stay O
at O
home O
himself, O
and O
keep O
all O
under O
shelter O
that O
he O
can;-- O
here O
are O
we O
setting O
forward O
to O
spend O
five O
dull O
hours O
in O
another O
man's O
house, O
with O
nothing O
to O
say O
or O
to O
hear O
that O
was O
not O
said O
and O
heard O
yesterday, O
and O
may O
not O
be O
said O
and O
heard O
again O
to-morrow. O
Going O
in O
dismal O
weather, O
to O
return O
probably O
in O
worse;-- O
four O
horses O
and O
four O
servants O
taken O
out O
for O
nothing O
but O
to O
convey O
five O
idle, O
shivering O
creatures O
into O
colder O
rooms O
and O
worse O
company O
than O
they O
might O
have O
had O
at O
home." O
Emma O
did O
not O
find O
herself O
equal O
to O
give O
the O
pleased O
assent, O
which O
no O
doubt O
he O
was O
in O
the O
habit O
of O
receiving, O
to O
emulate O
the O
"Very O
true, O
my O
love," O
which O
must O
have O
been O
usually O
administered O
by O
his O
travelling O
companion; O
but O
she O
had O
resolution O
enough O
to O
refrain O
from O
making O
any O
answer O
at O
all. O
 O
She O
could O
not O
be O
complying, O
she O
dreaded O
being O
quarrelsome; O
her O
heroism O
reached O
only O
to O
silence. O
 O
She O
allowed O
him O
to O
talk, O
and O
arranged O
the O
glasses, O
and O
wrapped O
herself O
up, O
without O
opening O
her O
lips. O
They O
arrived, O
the O
carriage O
turned, O
the O
step O
was O
let O
down, O
and O
Mr. O
Elton, O
spruce, O
black, O
and O
smiling, O
was O
with O
them O
instantly. O
 O
Emma O
thought O
with O
pleasure O
of O
some O
change O
of O
subject. O
 O
Mr. O
Elton O
was O
all O
obligation O
and O
cheerfulness; O
he O
was O
so O
very O
cheerful O
in O
his O
civilities O
indeed, O
that O
she O
began O
to O
think O
he O
must O
have O
received O
a O
different O
account O
of O
Harriet O
from O
what O
had O
reached O
her. O
 O
She O
had O
sent O
while O
dressing, O
and O
the O
answer O
had O
been, O
"Much O
the O
same-- O
not O
better." O
"My O
report O
from O
Mrs. O
Goddard's," O
said O
she O
presently, O
"was O
not O
so O
pleasant O
as O
I O
had O
hoped-- O
'Not O
better' O
was O
my O
answer." O
His O
face O
lengthened O
immediately; O
and O
his O
voice O
was O
the O
voice O
of O
sentiment O
as O
he O
answered. O
"Oh! O
no O
-- O
I O
am O
grieved O
to O
find O
-- O
I O
was O
on O
the O
point O
of O
telling O
you O
that O
when O
I O
called O
at O
Mrs. O
Goddard's O
door, O
which O
I O
did O
the O
very O
last O
thing O
before O
I O
returned O
to O
dress, O
I O
was O
told O
that O
Miss O
Smith O
was O
not O
better, O
by O
no O
means O
better, O
rather O
worse. O
 O
Very O
much O
grieved O
and O
concerned-- O
I O
had O
flattered O
myself O
that O
she O
must O
be O
better O
after O
such O
a O
cordial O
as O
I O
knew O
had O
been O
given O
her O
in O
the O
morning." O
Emma O
smiled O
and O
answered-- O
"My O
visit O
was O
of O
use O
to O
the O
nervous O
part O
of O
her O
complaint, O
I O
hope; O
but O
not O
even O
I O
can O
charm O
away O
a O
sore O
throat; O
it O
is O
a O
most O
severe O
cold O
indeed. O
 O
Mr. O
Perry O
has O
been O
with O
her, O
as O
you O
probably O
heard." O
"Yes O
-- O
I O
imagined-- O
that O
is O
-- O
I O
did O
not O
-- O
" O
"He O
has O
been O
used O
to O
her O
in O
these O
complaints, O
and O
I O
hope O
to-morrow O
morning O
will O
bring O
us O
both O
a O
more O
comfortable O
report. O
 O
But O
it O
is O
impossible O
not O
to O
feel O
uneasiness. O
 O
Such O
a O
sad O
loss O
to O
our O
party O
to-day!" O
"Dreadful!-- O
Exactly O
so, O
indeed.-- O
She O
will O
be O
missed O
every O
moment." O
This O
was O
very O
proper; O
the O
sigh O
which O
accompanied O
it O
was O
really O
estimable; O
but O
it O
should O
have O
lasted O
longer. O
 O
Emma O
was O
rather O
in O
dismay O
when O
only O
half O
a O
minute O
afterwards O
he O
began O
to O
speak O
of O
other O
things, O
and O
in O
a O
voice O
of O
the O
greatest O
alacrity O
and O
enjoyment. O
"What O
an O
excellent O
device," O
said O
he, O
"the O
use O
of O
a O
sheepskin O
for O
carriages. O
 O
How O
very O
comfortable O
they O
make O
it;-- O
impossible O
to O
feel O
cold O
with O
such O
precautions. O
 O
The O
contrivances O
of O
modern O
days O
indeed O
have O
rendered O
a O
gentleman's O
carriage O
perfectly O
complete. O
 O
One O
is O
so O
fenced O
and O
guarded O
from O
the O
weather, O
that O
not O
a O
breath O
of O
air O
can O
find O
its O
way O
unpermitted. O
 O
Weather O
becomes O
absolutely O
of O
no O
consequence. O
 O
It O
is O
a O
very O
cold O
afternoon-- O
but O
in O
this O
carriage O
we O
know O
nothing O
of O
the O
matter.-- O
Ha! O
snows O
a O
little O
I O
see." O
"Yes," O
said O
John O
Knightley, O
"and O
I O
think O
we O
shall O
have O
a O
good O
deal O
of O
it." O
"Christmas O
weather," O
observed O
Mr. O
Elton. O
 O
"Quite O
seasonable; O
and O
extremely O
fortunate O
we O
may O
think O
ourselves O
that O
it O
did O
not O
begin O
yesterday, O
and O
prevent O
this O
day's O
party, O
which O
it O
might O
very O
possibly O
have O
done, O
for O
Mr. O
Woodhouse O
would O
hardly O
have O
ventured O
had O
there O
been O
much O
snow O
on O
the O
ground; O
but O
now O
it O
is O
of O
no O
consequence. O
 O
This O
is O
quite O
the O
season O
indeed O
for O
friendly O
meetings. O
 O
At O
Christmas O
every O
body O
invites O
their O
friends O
about O
them, O
and O
people O
think O
little O
of O
even O
the O
worst O
weather. O
 O
I O
was O
snowed O
up O
at O
a O
friend's O
house O
once O
for O
a O
week. O
Nothing O
could O
be O
pleasanter. O
 O
I O
went O
for O
only O
one O
night, O
and O
could O
not O
get O
away O
till O
that O
very O
day O
se'nnight." O
Mr. O
John O
Knightley O
looked O
as O
if O
he O
did O
not O
comprehend O
the O
pleasure, O
but O
said O
only, O
coolly, O
"I O
cannot O
wish O
to O
be O
snowed O
up O
a O
week O
at O
Randalls." O
At O
another O
time O
Emma O
might O
have O
been O
amused, O
but O
she O
was O
too O
much O
astonished O
now O
at O
Mr. O
Elton's O
spirits O
for O
other O
feelings. O
 O
Harriet O
seemed O
quite O
forgotten O
in O
the O
expectation O
of O
a O
pleasant O
party. O
"We O
are O
sure O
of O
excellent O
fires," O
continued O
he, O
"and O
every O
thing O
in O
the O
greatest O
comfort. O
 O
Charming O
people, O
Mr. O
and O
Mrs. O
Weston;-- O
Mrs. O
Weston O
indeed O
is O
much O
beyond O
praise, O
and O
he O
is O
exactly O
what O
one O
values, O
so O
hospitable, O
and O
so O
fond O
of O
society;-- O
it O
will O
be O
a O
small O
party, O
but O
where O
small O
parties O
are O
select, O
they O
are O
perhaps O
the O
most O
agreeable O
of O
any. O
 O
Mr. O
Weston's O
dining-room O
does O
not O
accommodate O
more O
than O
ten O
comfortably; O
and O
for O
my O
part, O
I O
would O
rather, O
under O
such O
circumstances, O
fall O
short O
by O
two O
than O
exceed O
by O
two. O
 O
I O
think O
you O
will O
agree O
with O
me, O
(turning O
with O
a O
soft O
air O
to O
Emma,) O
I O
think O
I O
shall O
certainly O
have O
your O
approbation, O
though O
Mr. O
Knightley O
perhaps, O
from O
being O
used O
to O
the O
large O
parties O
of O
London, O
may O
not O
quite O
enter O
into O
our O
feelings." O
"I O
know O
nothing O
of O
the O
large O
parties O
of O
London, O
sir O
-- O
I O
never O
dine O
with O
any O
body." O
"Indeed! O
(in O
a O
tone O
of O
wonder O
and O
pity,) O
I O
had O
no O
idea O
that O
the O
law O
had O
been O
so O
great O
a O
slavery. O
 O
Well, O
sir, O
the O
time O
must O
come O
when O
you O
will O
be O
paid O
for O
all O
this, O
when O
you O
will O
have O
little O
labour O
and O
great O
enjoyment." O
"My O
first O
enjoyment," O
replied O
John O
Knightley, O
as O
they O
passed O
through O
the O
sweep-gate, O
"will O
be O
to O
find O
myself O
safe O
at O
Hartfield O
again." O
CHAPTER O
XIV O
Some O
change O
of O
countenance O
was O
necessary O
for O
each O
gentleman O
as O
they O
walked O
into O
Mrs. O
Weston's O
drawing-room;-- O
Mr. O
Elton O
must O
compose O
his O
joyous O
looks, O
and O
Mr. O
John O
Knightley O
disperse O
his O
ill-humour. O
Mr. O
Elton O
must O
smile O
less, O
and O
Mr. O
John O
Knightley O
more, O
to O
fit O
them O
for O
the O
place.-- O
Emma O
only O
might O
be O
as O
nature O
prompted, O
and O
shew O
herself O
just O
as O
happy O
as O
she O
was. O
 O
To O
her O
it O
was O
real O
enjoyment O
to O
be O
with O
the O
Westons. O
Mr. O
Weston O
was O
a O
great O
favourite, O
and O
there O
was O
not O
a O
creature O
in O
the O
world O
to O
whom O
she O
spoke O
with O
such O
unreserve, O
as O
to O
his O
wife; O
not O
any O
one, O
to O
whom O
she O
related O
with O
such O
conviction O
of O
being O
listened O
to O
and O
understood, O
of O
being O
always O
interesting O
and O
always O
intelligible, O
the O
little O
affairs, O
arrangements, O
perplexities, O
and O
pleasures O
of O
her O
father O
and O
herself. O
 O
She O
could O
tell O
nothing O
of O
Hartfield, O
in O
which O
Mrs. O
Weston O
had O
not O
a O
lively O
concern; O
and O
half O
an O
hour's O
uninterrupted O
communication O
of O
all O
those O
little O
matters O
on O
which O
the O
daily O
happiness O
of O
private O
life O
depends, O
was O
one O
of O
the O
first O
gratifications O
of O
each. O
This O
was O
a O
pleasure O
which O
perhaps O
the O
whole O
day's O
visit O
might O
not O
afford, O
which O
certainly O
did O
not O
belong O
to O
the O
present O
half-hour; O
but O
the O
very O
sight O
of O
Mrs. O
Weston, O
her O
smile, O
her O
touch, O
her O
voice O
was O
grateful O
to O
Emma, O
and O
she O
determined O
to O
think O
as O
little O
as O
possible O
of O
Mr. O
Elton's O
oddities, O
or O
of O
any O
thing O
else O
unpleasant, O
and O
enjoy O
all O
that O
was O
enjoyable O
to O
the O
utmost. O
The O
misfortune O
of O
Harriet's O
cold O
had O
been O
pretty O
well O
gone O
through O
before O
her O
arrival. O
 O
Mr. O
Woodhouse O
had O
been O
safely O
seated O
long O
enough O
to O
give O
the O
history O
of O
it, O
besides O
all O
the O
history O
of O
his O
own O
and O
Isabella's O
coming, O
and O
of O
Emma's O
being O
to O
follow, O
and O
had O
indeed O
just O
got O
to O
the O
end O
of O
his O
satisfaction O
that O
James O
should O
come O
and O
see O
his O
daughter, O
when O
the O
others O
appeared, O
and O
Mrs. O
Weston, O
who O
had O
been O
almost O
wholly O
engrossed O
by O
her O
attentions O
to O
him, O
was O
able O
to O
turn O
away O
and O
welcome O
her O
dear O
Emma. O
Emma's O
project O
of O
forgetting O
Mr. O
Elton O
for O
a O
while O
made O
her O
rather O
sorry O
to O
find, O
when O
they O
had O
all O
taken O
their O
places, O
that O
he O
was O
close O
to O
her. O
 O
The O
difficulty O
was O
great O
of O
driving O
his O
strange O
insensibility O
towards O
Harriet, O
from O
her O
mind, O
while O
he O
not O
only O
sat O
at O
her O
elbow, O
but O
was O
continually O
obtruding O
his O
happy O
countenance O
on O
her O
notice, O
and O
solicitously O
addressing O
her O
upon O
every O
occasion. O
 O
Instead O
of O
forgetting O
him, O
his O
behaviour O
was O
such O
that O
she O
could O
not O
avoid O
the O
internal O
suggestion O
of O
"Can O
it O
really O
be O
as O
my O
brother O
imagined? O
can O
it O
be O
possible O
for O
this O
man O
to O
be O
beginning O
to O
transfer O
his O
affections O
from O
Harriet O
to O
me?-- O
Absurd O
and O
insufferable!"-- O
Yet O
he O
would O
be O
so O
anxious O
for O
her O
being O
perfectly O
warm, O
would O
be O
so O
interested O
about O
her O
father, O
and O
so O
delighted O
with O
Mrs. O
Weston; O
and O
at O
last O
would O
begin O
admiring O
her O
drawings O
with O
so O
much O
zeal O
and O
so O
little O
knowledge O
as O
seemed O
terribly O
like O
a O
would-be O
lover, O
and O
made O
it O
some O
effort O
with O
her O
to O
preserve O
her O
good O
manners. O
 O
For O
her O
own O
sake O
she O
could O
not O
be O
rude; O
and O
for O
Harriet's, O
in O
the O
hope O
that O
all O
would O
yet O
turn O
out O
right, O
she O
was O
even O
positively O
civil; O
but O
it O
was O
an O
effort; O
especially O
as O
something O
was O
going O
on O
amongst O
the O
others, O
in O
the O
most O
overpowering O
period O
of O
Mr. O
Elton's O
nonsense, O
which O
she O
particularly O
wished O
to O
listen O
to. O
 O
She O
heard O
enough O
to O
know O
that O
Mr. O
Weston O
was O
giving O
some O
information O
about O
his O
son; O
she O
heard O
the O
words O
"my O
son," O
and O
"Frank," O
and O
"my O
son," O
repeated O
several O
times O
over; O
and, O
from O
a O
few O
other O
half-syllables O
very O
much O
suspected O
that O
he O
was O
announcing O
an O
early O
visit O
from O
his O
son; O
but O
before O
she O
could O
quiet O
Mr. O
Elton, O
the O
subject O
was O
so O
completely O
past O
that O
any O
reviving O
question O
from O
her O
would O
have O
been O
awkward. O
Now, O
it O
so O
happened O
that O
in O
spite O
of O
Emma's O
resolution O
of O
never O
marrying, O
there O
was O
something O
in O
the O
name, O
in O
the O
idea O
of O
Mr. O
Frank O
Churchill, O
which O
always O
interested O
her. O
 O
She O
had O
frequently O
thought-- O
especially O
since O
his O
father's O
marriage O
with O
Miss O
Taylor-- O
that O
if O
she O
were O
to O
marry, O
he O
was O
the O
very O
person O
to O
suit O
her O
in O
age, O
character O
and O
condition. O
 O
He O
seemed O
by O
this O
connexion O
between O
the O
families, O
quite O
to O
belong O
to O
her. O
 O
She O
could O
not O
but O
suppose O
it O
to O
be O
a O
match O
that O
every O
body O
who O
knew O
them O
must O
think O
of. O
 O
That O
Mr. O
and O
Mrs. O
Weston O
did O
think O
of O
it, O
she O
was O
very O
strongly O
persuaded; O
and O
though O
not O
meaning O
to O
be O
induced O
by O
him, O
or O
by O
any O
body O
else, O
to O
give O
up O
a O
situation O
which O
she O
believed O
more O
replete O
with O
good O
than O
any O
she O
could O
change O
it O
for, O
she O
had O
a O
great O
curiosity O
to O
see O
him, O
a O
decided O
intention O
of O
finding O
him O
pleasant, O
of O
being O
liked O
by O
him O
to O
a O
certain O
degree, O
and O
a O
sort O
of O
pleasure O
in O
the O
idea O
of O
their O
being O
coupled O
in O
their O
friends' O
imaginations. O
With O
such O
sensations, O
Mr. O
Elton's O
civilities O
were O
dreadfully O
ill-timed; O
but O
she O
had O
the O
comfort O
of O
appearing O
very O
polite, O
while O
feeling O
very O
cross-- O
and O
of O
thinking O
that O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
visit O
could O
not O
possibly O
pass O
without O
bringing O
forward O
the O
same O
information O
again, O
or O
the O
substance O
of O
it, O
from O
the O
open-hearted O
Mr. O
Weston.-- O
So O
it O
proved;-- O
for O
when O
happily O
released O
from O
Mr. O
Elton, O
and O
seated O
by O
Mr. O
Weston, O
at O
dinner, O
he O
made O
use O
of O
the O
very O
first O
interval O
in O
the O
cares O
of O
hospitality, O
the O
very O
first O
leisure O
from O
the O
saddle O
of O
mutton, O
to O
say O
to O
her, O
"We O
want O
only O
two O
more O
to O
be O
just O
the O
right O
number. O
 O
I O
should O
like O
to O
see O
two O
more O
here,-- O
your O
pretty O
little O
friend, O
Miss O
Smith, O
and O
my O
son-- O
and O
then O
I O
should O
say O
we O
were O
quite O
complete. O
 O
I O
believe O
you O
did O
not O
hear O
me O
telling O
the O
others O
in O
the O
drawing-room O
that O
we O
are O
expecting O
Frank. O
 O
I O
had O
a O
letter O
from O
him O
this O
morning, O
and O
he O
will O
be O
with O
us O
within O
a O
fortnight." O
Emma O
spoke O
with O
a O
very O
proper O
degree O
of O
pleasure; O
and O
fully O
assented O
to O
his O
proposition O
of O
Mr. O
Frank O
Churchill O
and O
Miss O
Smith O
making O
their O
party O
quite O
complete. O
"He O
has O
been O
wanting O
to O
come O
to O
us," O
continued O
Mr. O
Weston, O
"ever O
since O
September: O
 O
every O
letter O
has O
been O
full O
of O
it; O
but O
he O
cannot O
command O
his O
own O
time. O
 O
He O
has O
those O
to O
please O
who O
must O
be O
pleased, O
and O
who O
(between O
ourselves) O
are O
sometimes O
to O
be O
pleased O
only O
by O
a O
good O
many O
sacrifices. O
But O
now O
I O
have O
no O
doubt O
of O
seeing O
him O
here O
about O
the O
second O
week O
in O
January." O
"What O
a O
very O
great O
pleasure O
it O
will O
be O
to O
you! O
and O
Mrs. O
Weston O
is O
so O
anxious O
to O
be O
acquainted O
with O
him, O
that O
she O
must O
be O
almost O
as O
happy O
as O
yourself." O
"Yes, O
she O
would O
be, O
but O
that O
she O
thinks O
there O
will O
be O
another O
put-off. O
She O
does O
not O
depend O
upon O
his O
coming O
so O
much O
as O
I O
do: O
but O
she O
does O
not O
know O
the O
parties O
so O
well O
as O
I O
do. O
 O
The O
case, O
you O
see, O
is-- O
(but O
this O
is O
quite O
between O
ourselves: O
 O
I O
did O
not O
mention O
a O
syllable O
of O
it O
in O
the O
other O
room. O
 O
There O
are O
secrets O
in O
all O
families, O
you O
know)-- O
The O
case O
is, O
that O
a O
party O
of O
friends O
are O
invited O
to O
pay O
a O
visit O
at O
Enscombe O
in O
January; O
and O
that O
Frank's O
coming O
depends O
upon O
their O
being O
put O
off. O
 O
If O
they O
are O
not O
put O
off, O
he O
cannot O
stir. O
 O
But O
I O
know O
they O
will, O
because O
it O
is O
a O
family O
that O
a O
certain O
lady, O
of O
some O
consequence, O
at O
Enscombe, O
has O
a O
particular O
dislike O
to: O
and O
though O
it O
is O
thought O
necessary O
to O
invite O
them O
once O
in O
two O
or O
three O
years, O
they O
always O
are O
put O
off O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
the O
point. O
 O
I O
have O
not O
the O
smallest O
doubt O
of O
the O
issue. O
 O
I O
am O
as O
confident O
of O
seeing O
Frank O
here O
before O
the O
middle O
of O
January, O
as O
I O
am O
of O
being O
here O
myself: O
 O
but O
your O
good O
friend O
there O
(nodding O
towards O
the O
upper O
end O
of O
the O
table) O
has O
so O
few O
vagaries O
herself, O
and O
has O
been O
so O
little O
used O
to O
them O
at O
Hartfield, O
that O
she O
cannot O
calculate O
on O
their O
effects, O
as O
I O
have O
been O
long O
in O
the O
practice O
of O
doing." O
"I O
am O
sorry O
there O
should O
be O
any O
thing O
like O
doubt O
in O
the O
case," O
replied O
Emma; O
"but O
am O
disposed O
to O
side O
with O
you, O
Mr. O
Weston. O
 O
If O
you O
think O
he O
will O
come, O
I O
shall O
think O
so O
too; O
for O
you O
know O
Enscombe." O
"Yes O
-- O
I O
have O
some O
right O
to O
that O
knowledge; O
though O
I O
have O
never O
been O
at O
the O
place O
in O
my O
life.-- O
She O
is O
an O
odd O
woman!-- O
But O
I O
never O
allow O
myself O
to O
speak O
ill O
of O
her, O
on O
Frank's O
account; O
for O
I O
do O
believe O
her O
to O
be O
very O
fond O
of O
him. O
 O
I O
used O
to O
think O
she O
was O
not O
capable O
of O
being O
fond O
of O
any O
body, O
except O
herself: O
 O
but O
she O
has O
always O
been O
kind O
to O
him O
(in O
her O
way-- O
allowing O
for O
little O
whims O
and O
caprices, O
and O
expecting O
every O
thing O
to O
be O
as O
she O
likes). O
And O
it O
is O
no O
small O
credit, O
in O
my O
opinion, O
to O
him, O
that O
he O
should O
excite O
such O
an O
affection; O
for, O
though O
I O
would O
not O
say O
it O
to O
any O
body O
else, O
she O
has O
no O
more O
heart O
than O
a O
stone O
to O
people O
in O
general; O
and O
the O
devil O
of O
a O
temper." O
Emma O
liked O
the O
subject O
so O
well, O
that O
she O
began O
upon O
it, O
to O
Mrs. O
Weston, O
very O
soon O
after O
their O
moving O
into O
the O
drawing-room: O
wishing O
her O
joy-- O
yet O
observing, O
that O
she O
knew O
the O
first O
meeting O
must O
be O
rather O
alarming.-- O
Mrs. O
Weston O
agreed O
to O
it; O
but O
added, O
that O
she O
should O
be O
very O
glad O
to O
be O
secure O
of O
undergoing O
the O
anxiety O
of O
a O
first O
meeting O
at O
the O
time O
talked O
of: O
 O
"for O
I O
cannot O
depend O
upon O
his O
coming. O
 O
I O
cannot O
be O
so O
sanguine O
as O
Mr. O
Weston. O
 O
I O
am O
very O
much O
afraid O
that O
it O
will O
all O
end O
in O
nothing. O
 O
Mr. O
Weston, O
I O
dare O
say, O
has O
been O
telling O
you O
exactly O
how O
the O
matter O
stands?" O
"Yes-- O
it O
seems O
to O
depend O
upon O
nothing O
but O
the O
ill-humour O
of O
Mrs. O
Churchill, O
which O
I O
imagine O
to O
be O
the O
most O
certain O
thing O
in O
the O
world." O
"My O
Emma!" O
replied O
Mrs. O
Weston, O
smiling, O
"what O
is O
the O
certainty O
of O
caprice?" O
Then O
turning O
to O
Isabella, O
who O
had O
not O
been O
attending O
before-- O
"You O
must O
know, O
my O
dear O
Mrs. O
Knightley, O
that O
we O
are O
by O
no O
means O
so O
sure O
of O
seeing O
Mr. O
Frank O
Churchill, O
in O
my O
opinion, O
as O
his O
father O
thinks. O
 O
It O
depends O
entirely O
upon O
his O
aunt's O
spirits O
and O
pleasure; O
in O
short, O
upon O
her O
temper. O
 O
To O
you-- O
to O
my O
two O
daughters O
-- O
I O
may O
venture O
on O
the O
truth. O
 O
Mrs. O
Churchill O
rules O
at O
Enscombe, O
and O
is O
a O
very O
odd-tempered O
woman; O
and O
his O
coming O
now, O
depends O
upon O
her O
being O
willing O
to O
spare O
him." O
"Oh, O
Mrs. O
Churchill; O
every O
body O
knows O
Mrs. O
Churchill," O
replied O
Isabella: O
 O
"and O
I O
am O
sure O
I O
never O
think O
of O
that O
poor O
young O
man O
without O
the O
greatest O
compassion. O
 O
To O
be O
constantly O
living O
with O
an O
ill-tempered O
person, O
must O
be O
dreadful. O
 O
It O
is O
what O
we O
happily O
have O
never O
known O
any O
thing O
of; O
but O
it O
must O
be O
a O
life O
of O
misery. O
 O
What O
a O
blessing, O
that O
she O
never O
had O
any O
children! O
 O
Poor O
little O
creatures, O
how O
unhappy O
she O
would O
have O
made O
them!" O
Emma O
wished O
she O
had O
been O
alone O
with O
Mrs. O
Weston. O
 O
She O
should O
then O
have O
heard O
more: O
 O
Mrs. O
Weston O
would O
speak O
to O
her, O
with O
a O
degree O
of O
unreserve O
which O
she O
would O
not O
hazard O
with O
Isabella; O
and, O
she O
really O
believed, O
would O
scarcely O
try O
to O
conceal O
any O
thing O
relative O
to O
the O
Churchills O
from O
her, O
excepting O
those O
views O
on O
the O
young O
man, O
of O
which O
her O
own O
imagination O
had O
already O
given O
her O
such O
instinctive O
knowledge. O
 O
But O
at O
present O
there O
was O
nothing O
more O
to O
be O
said. O
 O
Mr. O
Woodhouse O
very O
soon O
followed O
them O
into O
the O
drawing-room. O
To O
be O
sitting O
long O
after O
dinner, O
was O
a O
confinement O
that O
he O
could O
not O
endure. O
 O
Neither O
wine O
nor O
conversation O
was O
any O
thing O
to O
him; O
and O
gladly O
did O
he O
move O
to O
those O
with O
whom O
he O
was O
always O
comfortable. O
While O
he O
talked O
to O
Isabella, O
however, O
Emma O
found O
an O
opportunity O
of O
saying, O
"And O
so O
you O
do O
not O
consider O
this O
visit O
from O
your O
son O
as O
by O
any O
means O
certain. O
 O
I O
am O
sorry O
for O
it. O
 O
The O
introduction O
must O
be O
unpleasant, O
whenever O
it O
takes O
place; O
and O
the O
sooner O
it O
could O
be O
over, O
the O
better." O
"Yes; O
and O
every O
delay O
makes O
one O
more O
apprehensive O
of O
other O
delays. O
Even O
if O
this O
family, O
the O
Braithwaites, O
are O
put O
off, O
I O
am O
still O
afraid O
that O
some O
excuse O
may O
be O
found O
for O
disappointing O
us. O
 O
I O
cannot O
bear O
to O
imagine O
any O
reluctance O
on O
his O
side; O
but O
I O
am O
sure O
there O
is O
a O
great O
wish O
on O
the O
Churchills' O
to O
keep O
him O
to O
themselves. O
 O
There O
is O
jealousy. O
 O
They O
are O
jealous O
even O
of O
his O
regard O
for O
his O
father. O
 O
In O
short, O
I O
can O
feel O
no O
dependence O
on O
his O
coming, O
and O
I O
wish O
Mr. O
Weston O
were O
less O
sanguine." O
"He O
ought O
to O
come," O
said O
Emma. O
 O
"If O
he O
could O
stay O
only O
a O
couple O
of O
days, O
he O
ought O
to O
come; O
and O
one O
can O
hardly O
conceive O
a O
young O
man's O
not O
having O
it O
in O
his O
power O
to O
do O
as O
much O
as O
that. O
 O
A O
young O
woman, O
if O
she O
fall O
into O
bad O
hands, O
may O
be O
teazed, O
and O
kept O
at O
a O
distance O
from O
those O
she O
wants O
to O
be O
with; O
but O
one O
cannot O
comprehend O
a O
young O
man's O
being O
under O
such O
restraint, O
as O
not O
to O
be O
able O
to O
spend O
a O
week O
with O
his O
father, O
if O
he O
likes O
it." O
"One O
ought O
to O
be O
at O
Enscombe, O
and O
know O
the O
ways O
of O
the O
family, O
before O
one O
decides O
upon O
what O
he O
can O
do," O
replied O
Mrs. O
Weston. O
 O
"One O
ought O
to O
use O
the O
same O
caution, O
perhaps, O
in O
judging O
of O
the O
conduct O
of O
any O
one O
individual O
of O
any O
one O
family; O
but O
Enscombe, O
I O
believe, O
certainly O
must O
not O
be O
judged O
by O
general O
rules: O
she O
is O
so O
very O
unreasonable; O
and O
every O
thing O
gives O
way O
to O
her." O
"But O
she O
is O
so O
fond O
of O
the O
nephew: O
 O
he O
is O
so O
very O
great O
a O
favourite. O
Now, O
according O
to O
my O
idea O
of O
Mrs. O
Churchill, O
it O
would O
be O
most O
natural, O
that O
while O
she O
makes O
no O
sacrifice O
for O
the O
comfort O
of O
the O
husband, O
to O
whom O
she O
owes O
every O
thing, O
while O
she O
exercises O
incessant O
caprice O
towards O
him, O
she O
should O
frequently O
be O
governed O
by O
the O
nephew, O
to O
whom O
she O
owes O
nothing O
at O
all." O
"My O
dearest O
Emma, O
do O
not O
pretend, O
with O
your O
sweet O
temper, O
to O
understand O
a O
bad O
one, O
or O
to O
lay O
down O
rules O
for O
it: O
 O
you O
must O
let O
it O
go O
its O
own O
way. O
 O
I O
have O
no O
doubt O
of O
his O
having, O
at O
times, O
considerable O
influence; O
but O
it O
may O
be O
perfectly O
impossible O
for O
him O
to O
know O
beforehand O
when O
it O
will O
be." O
Emma O
listened, O
and O
then O
coolly O
said, O
"I O
shall O
not O
be O
satisfied, O
unless O
he O
comes." O
"He O
may O
have O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
influence O
on O
some O
points," O
continued O
Mrs. O
Weston, O
"and O
on O
others, O
very O
little: O
 O
and O
among O
those, O
on O
which O
she O
is O
beyond O
his O
reach, O
it O
is O
but O
too O
likely, O
may O
be O
this O
very O
circumstance O
of O
his O
coming O
away O
from O
them O
to O
visit O
us." O
CHAPTER O
XV O
Mr. O
Woodhouse O
was O
soon O
ready O
for O
his O
tea; O
and O
when O
he O
had O
drank O
his O
tea O
he O
was O
quite O
ready O
to O
go O
home; O
and O
it O
was O
as O
much O
as O
his O
three O
companions O
could O
do, O
to O
entertain O
away O
his O
notice O
of O
the O
lateness O
of O
the O
hour, O
before O
the O
other O
gentlemen O
appeared. O
 O
Mr. O
Weston O
was O
chatty O
and O
convivial, O
and O
no O
friend O
to O
early O
separations O
of O
any O
sort; O
but O
at O
last O
the O
drawing-room O
party O
did O
receive O
an O
augmentation. O
 O
Mr. O
Elton, O
in O
very O
good O
spirits, O
was O
one O
of O
the O
first O
to O
walk O
in. O
 O
Mrs. O
Weston O
and O
Emma O
were O
sitting O
together O
on O
a O
sofa. O
 O
He O
joined O
them O
immediately, O
and, O
with O
scarcely O
an O
invitation, O
seated O
himself O
between O
them. O
Emma, O
in O
good O
spirits O
too, O
from O
the O
amusement O
afforded O
her O
mind O
by O
the O
expectation O
of O
Mr. O
Frank O
Churchill, O
was O
willing O
to O
forget O
his O
late O
improprieties, O
and O
be O
as O
well O
satisfied O
with O
him O
as O
before, O
and O
on O
his O
making O
Harriet O
his O
very O
first O
subject, O
was O
ready O
to O
listen O
with O
most O
friendly O
smiles. O
He O
professed O
himself O
extremely O
anxious O
about O
her O
fair O
friend-- O
her O
fair, O
lovely, O
amiable O
friend. O
 O
"Did O
she O
know?-- O
had O
she O
heard O
any O
thing O
about O
her, O
since O
their O
being O
at O
Randalls?-- O
he O
felt O
much O
anxiety-- O
he O
must O
confess O
that O
the O
nature O
of O
her O
complaint O
alarmed O
him O
considerably." O
And O
in O
this O
style O
he O
talked O
on O
for O
some O
time O
very O
properly, O
not O
much O
attending O
to O
any O
answer, O
but O
altogether O
sufficiently O
awake O
to O
the O
terror O
of O
a O
bad O
sore O
throat; O
and O
Emma O
was O
quite O
in O
charity O
with O
him. O
But O
at O
last O
there O
seemed O
a O
perverse O
turn; O
it O
seemed O
all O
at O
once O
as O
if O
he O
were O
more O
afraid O
of O
its O
being O
a O
bad O
sore O
throat O
on O
her O
account, O
than O
on O
Harriet's-- O
more O
anxious O
that O
she O
should O
escape O
the O
infection, O
than O
that O
there O
should O
be O
no O
infection O
in O
the O
complaint. O
 O
He O
began O
with O
great O
earnestness O
to O
entreat O
her O
to O
refrain O
from O
visiting O
the O
sick-chamber O
again, O
for O
the O
present-- O
to O
entreat O
her O
to O
promise O
him O
not O
to O
venture O
into O
such O
hazard O
till O
he O
had O
seen O
Mr. O
Perry O
and O
learnt O
his O
opinion; O
and O
though O
she O
tried O
to O
laugh O
it O
off O
and O
bring O
the O
subject O
back O
into O
its O
proper O
course, O
there O
was O
no O
putting O
an O
end O
to O
his O
extreme O
solicitude O
about O
her. O
 O
She O
was O
vexed. O
 O
It O
did O
appear-- O
there O
was O
no O
concealing O
it-- O
exactly O
like O
the O
pretence O
of O
being O
in O
love O
with O
her, O
instead O
of O
Harriet; O
an O
inconstancy, O
if O
real, O
the O
most O
contemptible O
and O
abominable! O
and O
she O
had O
difficulty O
in O
behaving O
with O
temper. O
 O
He O
turned O
to O
Mrs. O
Weston O
to O
implore O
her O
assistance, O
"Would O
not O
she O
give O
him O
her O
support?-- O
would O
not O
she O
add O
her O
persuasions O
to O
his, O
to O
induce O
Miss O
Woodhouse O
not O
to O
go O
to O
Mrs. O
Goddard's O
till O
it O
were O
certain O
that O
Miss O
Smith's O
disorder O
had O
no O
infection? O
 O
He O
could O
not O
be O
satisfied O
without O
a O
promise-- O
would O
not O
she O
give O
him O
her O
influence O
in O
procuring O
it?" O
"So O
scrupulous O
for O
others," O
he O
continued, O
"and O
yet O
so O
careless O
for O
herself! O
 O
She O
wanted O
me O
to O
nurse O
my O
cold O
by O
staying O
at O
home O
to-day, O
and O
yet O
will O
not O
promise O
to O
avoid O
the O
danger O
of O
catching O
an O
ulcerated O
sore O
throat O
herself. O
 O
Is O
this O
fair, O
Mrs. O
Weston?-- O
Judge O
between O
us. O
 O
Have O
not O
I O
some O
right O
to O
complain? O
 O
I O
am O
sure O
of O
your O
kind O
support O
and O
aid." O
Emma O
saw O
Mrs. O
Weston's O
surprize, O
and O
felt O
that O
it O
must O
be O
great, O
at O
an O
address O
which, O
in O
words O
and O
manner, O
was O
assuming O
to O
himself O
the O
right O
of O
first O
interest O
in O
her; O
and O
as O
for O
herself, O
she O
was O
too O
much O
provoked O
and O
offended O
to O
have O
the O
power O
of O
directly O
saying O
any O
thing O
to O
the O
purpose. O
 O
She O
could O
only O
give O
him O
a O
look; O
but O
it O
was O
such O
a O
look O
as O
she O
thought O
must O
restore O
him O
to O
his O
senses, O
and O
then O
left O
the O
sofa, O
removing O
to O
a O
seat O
by O
her O
sister, O
and O
giving O
her O
all O
her O
attention. O
She O
had O
not O
time O
to O
know O
how O
Mr. O
Elton O
took O
the O
reproof, O
so O
rapidly O
did O
another O
subject O
succeed; O
for O
Mr. O
John O
Knightley O
now O
came O
into O
the O
room O
from O
examining O
the O
weather, O
and O
opened O
on O
them O
all O
with O
the O
information O
of O
the O
ground O
being O
covered O
with O
snow, O
and O
of O
its O
still O
snowing O
fast, O
with O
a O
strong O
drifting O
wind; O
concluding O
with O
these O
words O
to O
Mr. O
Woodhouse: O
"This O
will O
prove O
a O
spirited O
beginning O
of O
your O
winter O
engagements, O
sir. O
Something O
new O
for O
your O
coachman O
and O
horses O
to O
be O
making O
their O
way O
through O
a O
storm O
of O
snow." O
Poor O
Mr. O
Woodhouse O
was O
silent O
from O
consternation; O
but O
every O
body O
else O
had O
something O
to O
say; O
every O
body O
was O
either O
surprized O
or O
not O
surprized, O
and O
had O
some O
question O
to O
ask, O
or O
some O
comfort O
to O
offer. O
 O
Mrs. O
Weston O
and O
Emma O
tried O
earnestly O
to O
cheer O
him O
and O
turn O
his O
attention O
from O
his O
son-in-law, O
who O
was O
pursuing O
his O
triumph O
rather O
unfeelingly. O
"I O
admired O
your O
resolution O
very O
much, O
sir," O
said O
he, O
"in O
venturing O
out O
in O
such O
weather, O
for O
of O
course O
you O
saw O
there O
would O
be O
snow O
very O
soon. O
Every O
body O
must O
have O
seen O
the O
snow O
coming O
on. O
 O
I O
admired O
your O
spirit; O
and O
I O
dare O
say O
we O
shall O
get O
home O
very O
well. O
 O
Another O
hour O
or O
two's O
snow O
can O
hardly O
make O
the O
road O
impassable; O
and O
we O
are O
two O
carriages; O
if O
one O
is O
blown O
over O
in O
the O
bleak O
part O
of O
the O
common O
field O
there O
will O
be O
the O
other O
at O
hand. O
 O
I O
dare O
say O
we O
shall O
be O
all O
safe O
at O
Hartfield O
before O
midnight." O
Mr. O
Weston, O
with O
triumph O
of O
a O
different O
sort, O
was O
confessing O
that O
he O
had O
known O
it O
to O
be O
snowing O
some O
time, O
but O
had O
not O
said O
a O
word, O
lest O
it O
should O
make O
Mr. O
Woodhouse O
uncomfortable, O
and O
be O
an O
excuse O
for O
his O
hurrying O
away. O
 O
As O
to O
there O
being O
any O
quantity O
of O
snow O
fallen O
or O
likely O
to O
fall O
to O
impede O
their O
return, O
that O
was O
a O
mere O
joke; O
he O
was O
afraid O
they O
would O
find O
no O
difficulty. O
 O
He O
wished O
the O
road O
might O
be O
impassable, O
that O
he O
might O
be O
able O
to O
keep O
them O
all O
at O
Randalls; O
and O
with O
the O
utmost O
good-will O
was O
sure O
that O
accommodation O
might O
be O
found O
for O
every O
body, O
calling O
on O
his O
wife O
to O
agree O
with O
him, O
that O
with O
a O
little O
contrivance, O
every O
body O
might O
be O
lodged, O
which O
she O
hardly O
knew O
how O
to O
do, O
from O
the O
consciousness O
of O
there O
being O
but O
two O
spare O
rooms O
in O
the O
house. O
"What O
is O
to O
be O
done, O
my O
dear O
Emma?-- O
what O
is O
to O
be O
done?" O
was O
Mr. O
Woodhouse's O
first O
exclamation, O
and O
all O
that O
he O
could O
say O
for O
some O
time. O
To O
her O
he O
looked O
for O
comfort; O
and O
her O
assurances O
of O
safety, O
her O
representation O
of O
the O
excellence O
of O
the O
horses, O
and O
of O
James, O
and O
of O
their O
having O
so O
many O
friends O
about O
them, O
revived O
him O
a O
little. O
His O
eldest O
daughter's O
alarm O
was O
equal O
to O
his O
own. O
 O
The O
horror O
of O
being O
blocked O
up O
at O
Randalls, O
while O
her O
children O
were O
at O
Hartfield, O
was O
full O
in O
her O
imagination; O
and O
fancying O
the O
road O
to O
be O
now O
just O
passable O
for O
adventurous O
people, O
but O
in O
a O
state O
that O
admitted O
no O
delay, O
she O
was O
eager O
to O
have O
it O
settled, O
that O
her O
father O
and O
Emma O
should O
remain O
at O
Randalls, O
while O
she O
and O
her O
husband O
set O
forward O
instantly O
through O
all O
the O
possible O
accumulations O
of O
drifted O
snow O
that O
might O
impede O
them. O
"You O
had O
better O
order O
the O
carriage O
directly, O
my O
love," O
said O
she; O
"I O
dare O
say O
we O
shall O
be O
able O
to O
get O
along, O
if O
we O
set O
off O
directly; O
and O
if O
we O
do O
come O
to O
any O
thing O
very O
bad, O
I O
can O
get O
out O
and O
walk. O
 O
I O
am O
not O
at O
all O
afraid. O
 O
I O
should O
not O
mind O
walking O
half O
the O
way. O
 O
I O
could O
change O
my O
shoes, O
you O
know, O
the O
moment O
I O
got O
home; O
and O
it O
is O
not O
the O
sort O
of O
thing O
that O
gives O
me O
cold." O
"Indeed!" O
replied O
he. O
 O
"Then, O
my O
dear O
Isabella, O
it O
is O
the O
most O
extraordinary O
sort O
of O
thing O
in O
the O
world, O
for O
in O
general O
every O
thing O
does O
give O
you O
cold. O
 O
Walk O
home!-- O
you O
are O
prettily O
shod O
for O
walking O
home, O
I O
dare O
say. O
 O
It O
will O
be O
bad O
enough O
for O
the O
horses." O
Isabella O
turned O
to O
Mrs. O
Weston O
for O
her O
approbation O
of O
the O
plan. O
 O
Mrs. O
Weston O
could O
only O
approve. O
 O
Isabella O
then O
went O
to O
Emma; O
but O
Emma O
could O
not O
so O
entirely O
give O
up O
the O
hope O
of O
their O
being O
all O
able O
to O
get O
away; O
and O
they O
were O
still O
discussing O
the O
point, O
when O
Mr. O
Knightley, O
who O
had O
left O
the O
room O
immediately O
after O
his O
brother's O
first O
report O
of O
the O
snow, O
came O
back O
again, O
and O
told O
them O
that O
he O
had O
been O
out O
of O
doors O
to O
examine, O
and O
could O
answer O
for O
there O
not O
being O
the O
smallest O
difficulty O
in O
their O
getting O
home, O
whenever O
they O
liked O
it, O
either O
now O
or O
an O
hour O
hence. O
 O
He O
had O
gone O
beyond O
the O
sweep-- O
some O
way O
along O
the O
Highbury O
road-- O
the O
snow O
was O
nowhere O
above O
half O
an O
inch O
deep-- O
in O
many O
places O
hardly O
enough O
to O
whiten O
the O
ground; O
a O
very O
few O
flakes O
were O
falling O
at O
present, O
but O
the O
clouds O
were O
parting, O
and O
there O
was O
every O
appearance O
of O
its O
being O
soon O
over. O
 O
He O
had O
seen O
the O
coachmen, O
and O
they O
both O
agreed O
with O
him O
in O
there O
being O
nothing O
to O
apprehend. O
To O
Isabella, O
the O
relief O
of O
such O
tidings O
was O
very O
great, O
and O
they O
were O
scarcely O
less O
acceptable O
to O
Emma O
on O
her O
father's O
account, O
who O
was O
immediately O
set O
as O
much O
at O
ease O
on O
the O
subject O
as O
his O
nervous O
constitution O
allowed; O
but O
the O
alarm O
that O
had O
been O
raised O
could O
not O
be O
appeased O
so O
as O
to O
admit O
of O
any O
comfort O
for O
him O
while O
he O
continued O
at O
Randalls. O
 O
He O
was O
satisfied O
of O
there O
being O
no O
present O
danger O
in O
returning O
home, O
but O
no O
assurances O
could O
convince O
him O
that O
it O
was O
safe O
to O
stay; O
and O
while O
the O
others O
were O
variously O
urging O
and O
recommending, O
Mr. O
Knightley O
and O
Emma O
settled O
it O
in O
a O
few O
brief O
sentences: O
 O
thus-- O
"Your O
father O
will O
not O
be O
easy; O
why O
do O
not O
you O
go?" O
"I O
am O
ready, O
if O
the O
others O
are." O
"Shall O
I O
ring O
the O
bell?" O
"Yes, O
do." O
And O
the O
bell O
was O
rung, O
and O
the O
carriages O
spoken O
for. O
 O
A O
few O
minutes O
more, O
and O
Emma O
hoped O
to O
see O
one O
troublesome O
companion O
deposited O
in O
his O
own O
house, O
to O
get O
sober O
and O
cool, O
and O
the O
other O
recover O
his O
temper O
and O
happiness O
when O
this O
visit O
of O
hardship O
were O
over. O
The O
carriage O
came: O
 O
and O
Mr. O
Woodhouse, O
always O
the O
first O
object O
on O
such O
occasions, O
was O
carefully O
attended O
to O
his O
own O
by O
Mr. O
Knightley O
and O
Mr. O
Weston; O
but O
not O
all O
that O
either O
could O
say O
could O
prevent O
some O
renewal O
of O
alarm O
at O
the O
sight O
of O
the O
snow O
which O
had O
actually O
fallen, O
and O
the O
discovery O
of O
a O
much O
darker O
night O
than O
he O
had O
been O
prepared O
for. O
 O
"He O
was O
afraid O
they O
should O
have O
a O
very O
bad O
drive. O
 O
He O
was O
afraid O
poor O
Isabella O
would O
not O
like O
it. O
 O
And O
there O
would O
be O
poor O
Emma O
in O
the O
carriage O
behind. O
 O
He O
did O
not O
know O
what O
they O
had O
best O
do. O
 O
They O
must O
keep O
as O
much O
together O
as O
they O
could;" O
and O
James O
was O
talked O
to, O
and O
given O
a O
charge O
to O
go O
very O
slow O
and O
wait O
for O
the O
other O
carriage. O
Isabella O
stept O
in O
after O
her O
father; O
John O
Knightley, O
forgetting O
that O
he O
did O
not O
belong O
to O
their O
party, O
stept O
in O
after O
his O
wife O
very O
naturally; O
so O
that O
Emma O
found, O
on O
being O
escorted O
and O
followed O
into O
the O
second O
carriage O
by O
Mr. O
Elton, O
that O
the O
door O
was O
to O
be O
lawfully O
shut O
on O
them, O
and O
that O
they O
were O
to O
have O
a O
tete-a-tete O
drive. O
 O
It O
would O
not O
have O
been O
the O
awkwardness O
of O
a O
moment, O
it O
would O
have O
been O
rather O
a O
pleasure, O
previous O
to O
the O
suspicions O
of O
this O
very O
day; O
she O
could O
have O
talked O
to O
him O
of O
Harriet, O
and O
the O
three-quarters O
of O
a O
mile O
would O
have O
seemed O
but O
one. O
 O
But O
now, O
she O
would O
rather O
it O
had O
not O
happened. O
 O
She O
believed O
he O
had O
been O
drinking O
too O
much O
of O
Mr. O
Weston's O
good O
wine, O
and O
felt O
sure O
that O
he O
would O
want O
to O
be O
talking O
nonsense. O
To O
restrain O
him O
as O
much O
as O
might O
be, O
by O
her O
own O
manners, O
she O
was O
immediately O
preparing O
to O
speak O
with O
exquisite O
calmness O
and O
gravity O
of O
the O
weather O
and O
the O
night; O
but O
scarcely O
had O
she O
begun, O
scarcely O
had O
they O
passed O
the O
sweep-gate O
and O
joined O
the O
other O
carriage, O
than O
she O
found O
her O
subject O
cut O
up-- O
her O
hand O
seized-- O
her O
attention O
demanded, O
and O
Mr. O
Elton O
actually O
making O
violent O
love O
to O
her: O
 O
availing O
himself O
of O
the O
precious O
opportunity, O
declaring O
sentiments O
which O
must O
be O
already O
well O
known, O
hoping-- O
fearing-- O
adoring-- O
ready O
to O
die O
if O
she O
refused O
him; O
but O
flattering O
himself O
that O
his O
ardent O
attachment O
and O
unequalled O
love O
and O
unexampled O
passion O
could O
not O
fail O
of O
having O
some O
effect, O
and O
in O
short, O
very O
much O
resolved O
on O
being O
seriously O
accepted O
as O
soon O
as O
possible. O
 O
It O
really O
was O
so. O
 O
Without O
scruple-- O
without O
apology-- O
without O
much O
apparent O
diffidence, O
Mr. O
Elton, O
the O
lover O
of O
Harriet, O
was O
professing O
himself O
her O
lover. O
 O
She O
tried O
to O
stop O
him; O
but O
vainly; O
he O
would O
go O
on, O
and O
say O
it O
all. O
 O
Angry O
as O
she O
was, O
the O
thought O
of O
the O
moment O
made O
her O
resolve O
to O
restrain O
herself O
when O
she O
did O
speak. O
 O
She O
felt O
that O
half O
this O
folly O
must O
be O
drunkenness, O
and O
therefore O
could O
hope O
that O
it O
might O
belong O
only O
to O
the O
passing O
hour. O
 O
Accordingly, O
with O
a O
mixture O
of O
the O
serious O
and O
the O
playful, O
which O
she O
hoped O
would O
best O
suit O
his O
half O
and O
half O
state, O
she O
replied, O
"I O
am O
very O
much O
astonished, O
Mr. O
Elton. O
 O
This O
to O
me! O
you O
forget O
yourself-- O
you O
take O
me O
for O
my O
friend-- O
any O
message O
to O
Miss O
Smith O
I O
shall O
be O
happy O
to O
deliver; O
but O
no O
more O
of O
this O
to O
me, O
if O
you O
please." O
"Miss O
Smith!-- O
message O
to O
Miss O
Smith!-- O
What O
could O
she O
possibly O
mean!"-- O
And O
he O
repeated O
her O
words O
with O
such O
assurance O
of O
accent, O
such O
boastful O
pretence O
of O
amazement, O
that O
she O
could O
not O
help O
replying O
with O
quickness, O
"Mr. O
Elton, O
this O
is O
the O
most O
extraordinary O
conduct! O
and O
I O
can O
account O
for O
it O
only O
in O
one O
way; O
you O
are O
not O
yourself, O
or O
you O
could O
not O
speak O
either O
to O
me, O
or O
of O
Harriet, O
in O
such O
a O
manner. O
 O
Command O
yourself O
enough O
to O
say O
no O
more, O
and O
I O
will O
endeavour O
to O
forget O
it." O
But O
Mr. O
Elton O
had O
only O
drunk O
wine O
enough O
to O
elevate O
his O
spirits, O
not O
at O
all O
to O
confuse O
his O
intellects. O
 O
He O
perfectly O
knew O
his O
own O
meaning; O
and O
having O
warmly O
protested O
against O
her O
suspicion O
as O
most O
injurious, O
and O
slightly O
touched O
upon O
his O
respect O
for O
Miss O
Smith O
as O
her O
friend,-- O
but O
acknowledging O
his O
wonder O
that O
Miss O
Smith O
should O
be O
mentioned O
at O
all,-- O
he O
resumed O
the O
subject O
of O
his O
own O
passion, O
and O
was O
very O
urgent O
for O
a O
favourable O
answer. O
As O
she O
thought O
less O
of O
his O
inebriety, O
she O
thought O
more O
of O
his O
inconstancy O
and O
presumption; O
and O
with O
fewer O
struggles O
for O
politeness, O
replied, O
"It O
is O
impossible O
for O
me O
to O
doubt O
any O
longer. O
 O
You O
have O
made O
yourself O
too O
clear. O
 O
Mr. O
Elton, O
my O
astonishment O
is O
much O
beyond O
any O
thing O
I O
can O
express. O
 O
After O
such O
behaviour, O
as O
I O
have O
witnessed O
during O
the O
last O
month, O
to O
Miss O
Smith-- O
such O
attentions O
as O
I O
have O
been O
in O
the O
daily O
habit O
of O
observing-- O
to O
be O
addressing O
me O
in O
this O
manner-- O
this O
is O
an O
unsteadiness O
of O
character, O
indeed, O
which O
I O
had O
not O
supposed O
possible! O
Believe O
me, O
sir, O
I O
am O
far, O
very O
far, O
from O
gratified O
in O
being O
the O
object O
of O
such O
professions." O
"Good O
Heaven!" O
cried O
Mr. O
Elton, O
"what O
can O
be O
the O
meaning O
of O
this?-- O
Miss O
Smith! O
-- O
I O
never O
thought O
of O
Miss O
Smith O
in O
the O
whole O
course O
of O
my O
existence-- O
never O
paid O
her O
any O
attentions, O
but O
as O
your O
friend: O
never O
cared O
whether O
she O
were O
dead O
or O
alive, O
but O
as O
your O
friend. O
 O
If O
she O
has O
fancied O
otherwise, O
her O
own O
wishes O
have O
misled O
her, O
and O
I O
am O
very O
sorry-- O
extremely O
sorry-- O
But, O
Miss O
Smith, O
indeed!-- O
Oh! O
 O
Miss O
Woodhouse! O
who O
can O
think O
of O
Miss O
Smith, O
when O
Miss O
Woodhouse O
is O
near! O
 O
No, O
upon O
my O
honour, O
there O
is O
no O
unsteadiness O
of O
character. O
 O
I O
have O
thought O
only O
of O
you. O
 O
I O
protest O
against O
having O
paid O
the O
smallest O
attention O
to O
any O
one O
else. O
 O
Every O
thing O
that O
I O
have O
said O
or O
done, O
for O
many O
weeks O
past, O
has O
been O
with O
the O
sole O
view O
of O
marking O
my O
adoration O
of O
yourself. O
 O
You O
cannot O
really, O
seriously, O
doubt O
it. O
 O
No!-- O
(in O
an O
accent O
meant O
to O
be O
insinuating) O
-- O
I O
am O
sure O
you O
have O
seen O
and O
understood O
me." O
It O
would O
be O
impossible O
to O
say O
what O
Emma O
felt, O
on O
hearing O
this-- O
which O
of O
all O
her O
unpleasant O
sensations O
was O
uppermost. O
 O
She O
was O
too O
completely O
overpowered O
to O
be O
immediately O
able O
to O
reply: O
and O
two O
moments O
of O
silence O
being O
ample O
encouragement O
for O
Mr. O
Elton's O
sanguine O
state O
of O
mind, O
he O
tried O
to O
take O
her O
hand O
again, O
as O
he O
joyously O
exclaimed-- O
"Charming O
Miss O
Woodhouse! O
allow O
me O
to O
interpret O
this O
interesting O
silence. O
 O
It O
confesses O
that O
you O
have O
long O
understood O
me." O
"No, O
sir," O
cried O
Emma, O
"it O
confesses O
no O
such O
thing. O
 O
So O
far O
from O
having O
long O
understood O
you, O
I O
have O
been O
in O
a O
most O
complete O
error O
with O
respect O
to O
your O
views, O
till O
this O
moment. O
 O
As O
to O
myself, O
I O
am O
very O
sorry O
that O
you O
should O
have O
been O
giving O
way O
to O
any O
feelings-- O
Nothing O
could O
be O
farther O
from O
my O
wishes-- O
your O
attachment O
to O
my O
friend O
Harriet-- O
your O
pursuit O
of O
her, O
(pursuit, O
it O
appeared,) O
gave O
me O
great O
pleasure, O
and O
I O
have O
been O
very O
earnestly O
wishing O
you O
success: O
but O
had O
I O
supposed O
that O
she O
were O
not O
your O
attraction O
to O
Hartfield, O
I O
should O
certainly O
have O
thought O
you O
judged O
ill O
in O
making O
your O
visits O
so O
frequent. O
 O
Am O
I O
to O
believe O
that O
you O
have O
never O
sought O
to O
recommend O
yourself O
particularly O
to O
Miss O
Smith?-- O
that O
you O
have O
never O
thought O
seriously O
of O
her?" O
"Never, O
madam," O
cried O
he, O
affronted O
in O
his O
turn: O
 O
"never, O
I O
assure O
you. O
I O
think O
seriously O
of O
Miss O
Smith!-- O
Miss O
Smith O
is O
a O
very O
good O
sort O
of O
girl; O
and O
I O
should O
be O
happy O
to O
see O
her O
respectably O
settled. O
 O
I O
wish O
her O
extremely O
well: O
 O
and, O
no O
doubt, O
there O
are O
men O
who O
might O
not O
object O
to-- O
Every O
body O
has O
their O
level: O
 O
but O
as O
for O
myself, O
I O
am O
not, O
I O
think, O
quite O
so O
much O
at O
a O
loss. O
 O
I O
need O
not O
so O
totally O
despair O
of O
an O
equal O
alliance, O
as O
to O
be O
addressing O
myself O
to O
Miss O
Smith!-- O
No, O
madam, O
my O
visits O
to O
Hartfield O
have O
been O
for O
yourself O
only; O
and O
the O
encouragement O
I O
received O
-- O
" O
"Encouragement! O
-- O
I O
give O
you O
encouragement!-- O
Sir, O
you O
have O
been O
entirely O
mistaken O
in O
supposing O
it. O
 O
I O
have O
seen O
you O
only O
as O
the O
admirer O
of O
my O
friend. O
 O
In O
no O
other O
light O
could O
you O
have O
been O
more O
to O
me O
than O
a O
common O
acquaintance. O
 O
I O
am O
exceedingly O
sorry: O
 O
but O
it O
is O
well O
that O
the O
mistake O
ends O
where O
it O
does. O
 O
Had O
the O
same O
behaviour O
continued, O
Miss O
Smith O
might O
have O
been O
led O
into O
a O
misconception O
of O
your O
views; O
not O
being O
aware, O
probably, O
any O
more O
than O
myself, O
of O
the O
very O
great O
inequality O
which O
you O
are O
so O
sensible O
of. O
 O
But, O
as O
it O
is, O
the O
disappointment O
is O
single, O
and, O
I O
trust, O
will O
not O
be O
lasting. O
 O
I O
have O
no O
thoughts O
of O
matrimony O
at O
present." O
He O
was O
too O
angry O
to O
say O
another O
word; O
her O
manner O
too O
decided O
to O
invite O
supplication; O
and O
in O
this O
state O
of O
swelling O
resentment, O
and O
mutually O
deep O
mortification, O
they O
had O
to O
continue O
together O
a O
few O
minutes O
longer, O
for O
the O
fears O
of O
Mr. O
Woodhouse O
had O
confined O
them O
to O
a O
foot-pace. O
If O
there O
had O
not O
been O
so O
much O
anger, O
there O
would O
have O
been O
desperate O
awkwardness; O
but O
their O
straightforward O
emotions O
left O
no O
room O
for O
the O
little O
zigzags O
of O
embarrassment. O
 O
Without O
knowing O
when O
the O
carriage O
turned O
into O
Vicarage O
Lane, O
or O
when O
it O
stopped, O
they O
found O
themselves, O
all O
at O
once, O
at O
the O
door O
of O
his O
house; O
and O
he O
was O
out O
before O
another O
syllable O
passed.-- O
Emma O
then O
felt O
it O
indispensable O
to O
wish O
him O
a O
good O
night. O
 O
The O
compliment O
was O
just O
returned, O
coldly O
and O
proudly; O
and, O
under O
indescribable O
irritation O
of O
spirits, O
she O
was O
then O
conveyed O
to O
Hartfield. O
There O
she O
was O
welcomed, O
with O
the O
utmost O
delight, O
by O
her O
father, O
who O
had O
been O
trembling O
for O
the O
dangers O
of O
a O
solitary O
drive O
from O
Vicarage O
Lane-- O
turning O
a O
corner O
which O
he O
could O
never O
bear O
to O
think O
of-- O
and O
in O
strange O
hands O
-- O
a O
mere O
common O
coachman-- O
no O
James; O
and O
there O
it O
seemed O
as O
if O
her O
return O
only O
were O
wanted O
to O
make O
every O
thing O
go O
well: O
for O
Mr. O
John O
Knightley, O
ashamed O
of O
his O
ill-humour, O
was O
now O
all O
kindness O
and O
attention; O
and O
so O
particularly O
solicitous O
for O
the O
comfort O
of O
her O
father, O
as O
to O
seem-- O
if O
not O
quite O
ready O
to O
join O
him O
in O
a O
basin O
of O
gruel-- O
perfectly O
sensible O
of O
its O
being O
exceedingly O
wholesome; O
and O
the O
day O
was O
concluding O
in O
peace O
and O
comfort O
to O
all O
their O
little O
party, O
except O
herself.-- O
But O
her O
mind O
had O
never O
been O
in O
such O
perturbation; O
and O
it O
needed O
a O
very O
strong O
effort O
to O
appear O
attentive O
and O
cheerful O
till O
the O
usual O
hour O
of O
separating O
allowed O
her O
the O
relief O
of O
quiet O
reflection. O
CHAPTER O
XVI O
The O
hair O
was O
curled, O
and O
the O
maid O
sent O
away, O
and O
Emma O
sat O
down O
to O
think O
and O
be O
miserable.-- O
It O
was O
a O
wretched O
business O
indeed!-- O
Such O
an O
overthrow O
of O
every O
thing O
she O
had O
been O
wishing O
for!-- O
Such O
a O
development O
of O
every O
thing O
most O
unwelcome!-- O
Such O
a O
blow O
for O
Harriet!-- O
that O
was O
the O
worst O
of O
all. O
 O
Every O
part O
of O
it O
brought O
pain O
and O
humiliation, O
of O
some O
sort O
or O
other; O
but, O
compared O
with O
the O
evil O
to O
Harriet, O
all O
was O
light; O
and O
she O
would O
gladly O
have O
submitted O
to O
feel O
yet O
more O
mistaken-- O
more O
in O
error-- O
more O
disgraced O
by O
mis-judgment, O
than O
she O
actually O
was, O
could O
the O
effects O
of O
her O
blunders O
have O
been O
confined O
to O
herself. O
"If O
I O
had O
not O
persuaded O
Harriet O
into O
liking O
the O
man, O
I O
could O
have O
borne O
any O
thing. O
 O
He O
might O
have O
doubled O
his O
presumption O
to O
me-- O
but O
poor O
Harriet!" O
How O
she O
could O
have O
been O
so O
deceived!-- O
He O
protested O
that O
he O
had O
never O
thought O
seriously O
of O
Harriet-- O
never! O
 O
She O
looked O
back O
as O
well O
as O
she O
could; O
but O
it O
was O
all O
confusion. O
 O
She O
had O
taken O
up O
the O
idea, O
she O
supposed, O
and O
made O
every O
thing O
bend O
to O
it. O
 O
His O
manners, O
however, O
must O
have O
been O
unmarked, O
wavering, O
dubious, O
or O
she O
could O
not O
have O
been O
so O
misled. O
The O
picture!-- O
How O
eager O
he O
had O
been O
about O
the O
picture!-- O
and O
the O
charade!-- O
and O
an O
hundred O
other O
circumstances;-- O
how O
clearly O
they O
had O
seemed O
to O
point O
at O
Harriet. O
 O
To O
be O
sure, O
the O
charade, O
with O
its O
"ready O
wit"-- O
but O
then O
the O
"soft O
eyes"-- O
in O
fact O
it O
suited O
neither; O
it O
was O
a O
jumble O
without O
taste O
or O
truth. O
 O
Who O
could O
have O
seen O
through O
such O
thick-headed O
nonsense? O
Certainly O
she O
had O
often, O
especially O
of O
late, O
thought O
his O
manners O
to O
herself O
unnecessarily O
gallant; O
but O
it O
had O
passed O
as O
his O
way, O
as O
a O
mere O
error O
of O
judgment, O
of O
knowledge, O
of O
taste, O
as O
one O
proof O
among O
others O
that O
he O
had O
not O
always O
lived O
in O
the O
best O
society, O
that O
with O
all O
the O
gentleness O
of O
his O
address, O
true O
elegance O
was O
sometimes O
wanting; O
but, O
till O
this O
very O
day, O
she O
had O
never, O
for O
an O
instant, O
suspected O
it O
to O
mean O
any O
thing O
but O
grateful O
respect O
to O
her O
as O
Harriet's O
friend. O
To O
Mr. O
John O
Knightley O
was O
she O
indebted O
for O
her O
first O
idea O
on O
the O
subject, O
for O
the O
first O
start O
of O
its O
possibility. O
 O
There O
was O
no O
denying O
that O
those O
brothers O
had O
penetration. O
 O
She O
remembered O
what O
Mr. O
Knightley O
had O
once O
said O
to O
her O
about O
Mr. O
Elton, O
the O
caution O
he O
had O
given, O
the O
conviction O
he O
had O
professed O
that O
Mr. O
Elton O
would O
never O
marry O
indiscreetly; O
and O
blushed O
to O
think O
how O
much O
truer O
a O
knowledge O
of O
his O
character O
had O
been O
there O
shewn O
than O
any O
she O
had O
reached O
herself. O
 O
It O
was O
dreadfully O
mortifying; O
but O
Mr. O
Elton O
was O
proving O
himself, O
in O
many O
respects, O
the O
very O
reverse O
of O
what O
she O
had O
meant O
and O
believed O
him; O
proud, O
assuming, O
conceited; O
very O
full O
of O
his O
own O
claims, O
and O
little O
concerned O
about O
the O
feelings O
of O
others. O
Contrary O
to O
the O
usual O
course O
of O
things, O
Mr. O
Elton's O
wanting O
to O
pay O
his O
addresses O
to O
her O
had O
sunk O
him O
in O
her O
opinion. O
 O
His O
professions O
and O
his O
proposals O
did O
him O
no O
service. O
 O
She O
thought O
nothing O
of O
his O
attachment, O
and O
was O
insulted O
by O
his O
hopes. O
 O
He O
wanted O
to O
marry O
well, O
and O
having O
the O
arrogance O
to O
raise O
his O
eyes O
to O
her, O
pretended O
to O
be O
in O
love; O
but O
she O
was O
perfectly O
easy O
as O
to O
his O
not O
suffering O
any O
disappointment O
that O
need O
be O
cared O
for. O
 O
There O
had O
been O
no O
real O
affection O
either O
in O
his O
language O
or O
manners. O
 O
Sighs O
and O
fine O
words O
had O
been O
given O
in O
abundance; O
but O
she O
could O
hardly O
devise O
any O
set O
of O
expressions, O
or O
fancy O
any O
tone O
of O
voice, O
less O
allied O
with O
real O
love. O
 O
She O
need O
not O
trouble O
herself O
to O
pity O
him. O
He O
only O
wanted O
to O
aggrandise O
and O
enrich O
himself; O
and O
if O
Miss O
Woodhouse O
of O
Hartfield, O
the O
heiress O
of O
thirty O
thousand O
pounds, O
were O
not O
quite O
so O
easily O
obtained O
as O
he O
had O
fancied, O
he O
would O
soon O
try O
for O
Miss O
Somebody O
else O
with O
twenty, O
or O
with O
ten. O
But-- O
that O
he O
should O
talk O
of O
encouragement, O
should O
consider O
her O
as O
aware O
of O
his O
views, O
accepting O
his O
attentions, O
meaning O
(in O
short), O
to O
marry O
him!-- O
should O
suppose O
himself O
her O
equal O
in O
connexion O
or O
mind!-- O
look O
down O
upon O
her O
friend, O
so O
well O
understanding O
the O
gradations O
of O
rank O
below O
him, O
and O
be O
so O
blind O
to O
what O
rose O
above, O
as O
to O
fancy O
himself O
shewing O
no O
presumption O
in O
addressing O
her!-- O
It O
was O
most O
provoking. O
Perhaps O
it O
was O
not O
fair O
to O
expect O
him O
to O
feel O
how O
very O
much O
he O
was O
her O
inferior O
in O
talent, O
and O
all O
the O
elegancies O
of O
mind. O
 O
The O
very O
want O
of O
such O
equality O
might O
prevent O
his O
perception O
of O
it; O
but O
he O
must O
know O
that O
in O
fortune O
and O
consequence O
she O
was O
greatly O
his O
superior. O
 O
He O
must O
know O
that O
the O
Woodhouses O
had O
been O
settled O
for O
several O
generations O
at O
Hartfield, O
the O
younger O
branch O
of O
a O
very O
ancient O
family-- O
and O
that O
the O
Eltons O
were O
nobody. O
 O
The O
landed O
property O
of O
Hartfield O
certainly O
was O
inconsiderable, O
being O
but O
a O
sort O
of O
notch O
in O
the O
Donwell O
Abbey O
estate, O
to O
which O
all O
the O
rest O
of O
Highbury O
belonged; O
but O
their O
fortune, O
from O
other O
sources, O
was O
such O
as O
to O
make O
them O
scarcely O
secondary O
to O
Donwell O
Abbey O
itself, O
in O
every O
other O
kind O
of O
consequence; O
and O
the O
Woodhouses O
had O
long O
held O
a O
high O
place O
in O
the O
consideration O
of O
the O
neighbourhood O
which O
Mr. O
Elton O
had O
first O
entered O
not O
two O
years O
ago, O
to O
make O
his O
way O
as O
he O
could, O
without O
any O
alliances O
but O
in O
trade, O
or O
any O
thing O
to O
recommend O
him O
to O
notice O
but O
his O
situation O
and O
his O
civility.-- O
But O
he O
had O
fancied O
her O
in O
love O
with O
him; O
that O
evidently O
must O
have O
been O
his O
dependence; O
and O
after O
raving O
a O
little O
about O
the O
seeming O
incongruity O
of O
gentle O
manners O
and O
a O
conceited O
head, O
Emma O
was O
obliged O
in O
common O
honesty O
to O
stop O
and O
admit O
that O
her O
own O
behaviour O
to O
him O
had O
been O
so O
complaisant O
and O
obliging, O
so O
full O
of O
courtesy O
and O
attention, O
as O
(supposing O
her O
real O
motive O
unperceived) O
might O
warrant O
a O
man O
of O
ordinary O
observation O
and O
delicacy, O
like O
Mr. O
Elton, O
in O
fancying O
himself O
a O
very O
decided O
favourite. O
If O
she O
had O
so O
misinterpreted O
his O
feelings, O
she O
had O
little O
right O
to O
wonder O
that O
he, O
with O
self-interest O
to O
blind O
him, O
should O
have O
mistaken O
hers. O
The O
first O
error O
and O
the O
worst O
lay O
at O
her O
door. O
 O
It O
was O
foolish, O
it O
was O
wrong, O
to O
take O
so O
active O
a O
part O
in O
bringing O
any O
two O
people O
together. O
It O
was O
adventuring O
too O
far, O
assuming O
too O
much, O
making O
light O
of O
what O
ought O
to O
be O
serious, O
a O
trick O
of O
what O
ought O
to O
be O
simple. O
 O
She O
was O
quite O
concerned O
and O
ashamed, O
and O
resolved O
to O
do O
such O
things O
no O
more. O
"Here O
have O
I," O
said O
she, O
"actually O
talked O
poor O
Harriet O
into O
being O
very O
much O
attached O
to O
this O
man. O
 O
She O
might O
never O
have O
thought O
of O
him O
but O
for O
me; O
and O
certainly O
never O
would O
have O
thought O
of O
him O
with O
hope, O
if O
I O
had O
not O
assured O
her O
of O
his O
attachment, O
for O
she O
is O
as O
modest O
and O
humble O
as O
I O
used O
to O
think O
him. O
 O
Oh! O
that O
I O
had O
been O
satisfied O
with O
persuading O
her O
not O
to O
accept O
young O
Martin. O
 O
There O
I O
was O
quite O
right. O
 O
That O
was O
well O
done O
of O
me; O
but O
there O
I O
should O
have O
stopped, O
and O
left O
the O
rest O
to O
time O
and O
chance. O
 O
I O
was O
introducing O
her O
into O
good O
company, O
and O
giving O
her O
the O
opportunity O
of O
pleasing O
some O
one O
worth O
having; O
I O
ought O
not O
to O
have O
attempted O
more. O
 O
But O
now, O
poor O
girl, O
her O
peace O
is O
cut O
up O
for O
some O
time. O
I O
have O
been O
but O
half O
a O
friend O
to O
her; O
and O
if O
she O
were O
not O
to O
feel O
this O
disappointment O
so O
very O
much, O
I O
am O
sure O
I O
have O
not O
an O
idea O
of O
any O
body O
else O
who O
would O
be O
at O
all O
desirable O
for O
her;-- O
William O
Coxe-- O
Oh! O
no, O
I O
could O
not O
endure O
William O
Coxe O
-- O
a O
pert O
young O
lawyer." O
She O
stopt O
to O
blush O
and O
laugh O
at O
her O
own O
relapse, O
and O
then O
resumed O
a O
more O
serious, O
more O
dispiriting O
cogitation O
upon O
what O
had O
been, O
and O
might O
be, O
and O
must O
be. O
 O
The O
distressing O
explanation O
she O
had O
to O
make O
to O
Harriet, O
and O
all O
that O
poor O
Harriet O
would O
be O
suffering, O
with O
the O
awkwardness O
of O
future O
meetings, O
the O
difficulties O
of O
continuing O
or O
discontinuing O
the O
acquaintance, O
of O
subduing O
feelings, O
concealing O
resentment, O
and O
avoiding O
eclat, O
were O
enough O
to O
occupy O
her O
in O
most O
unmirthful O
reflections O
some O
time O
longer, O
and O
she O
went O
to O
bed O
at O
last O
with O
nothing O
settled O
but O
the O
conviction O
of O
her O
having O
blundered O
most O
dreadfully. O
To O
youth O
and O
natural O
cheerfulness O
like O
Emma's, O
though O
under O
temporary O
gloom O
at O
night, O
the O
return O
of O
day O
will O
hardly O
fail O
to O
bring O
return O
of O
spirits. O
 O
The O
youth O
and O
cheerfulness O
of O
morning O
are O
in O
happy O
analogy, O
and O
of O
powerful O
operation; O
and O
if O
the O
distress O
be O
not O
poignant O
enough O
to O
keep O
the O
eyes O
unclosed, O
they O
will O
be O
sure O
to O
open O
to O
sensations O
of O
softened O
pain O
and O
brighter O
hope. O
Emma O
got O
up O
on O
the O
morrow O
more O
disposed O
for O
comfort O
than O
she O
had O
gone O
to O
bed, O
more O
ready O
to O
see O
alleviations O
of O
the O
evil O
before O
her, O
and O
to O
depend O
on O
getting O
tolerably O
out O
of O
it. O
It O
was O
a O
great O
consolation O
that O
Mr. O
Elton O
should O
not O
be O
really O
in O
love O
with O
her, O
or O
so O
particularly O
amiable O
as O
to O
make O
it O
shocking O
to O
disappoint O
him-- O
that O
Harriet's O
nature O
should O
not O
be O
of O
that O
superior O
sort O
in O
which O
the O
feelings O
are O
most O
acute O
and O
retentive-- O
and O
that O
there O
could O
be O
no O
necessity O
for O
any O
body's O
knowing O
what O
had O
passed O
except O
the O
three O
principals, O
and O
especially O
for O
her O
father's O
being O
given O
a O
moment's O
uneasiness O
about O
it. O
These O
were O
very O
cheering O
thoughts; O
and O
the O
sight O
of O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
snow O
on O
the O
ground O
did O
her O
further O
service, O
for O
any O
thing O
was O
welcome O
that O
might O
justify O
their O
all O
three O
being O
quite O
asunder O
at O
present. O
The O
weather O
was O
most O
favourable O
for O
her; O
though O
Christmas O
Day, O
she O
could O
not O
go O
to O
church. O
 O
Mr. O
Woodhouse O
would O
have O
been O
miserable O
had O
his O
daughter O
attempted O
it, O
and O
she O
was O
therefore O
safe O
from O
either O
exciting O
or O
receiving O
unpleasant O
and O
most O
unsuitable O
ideas. O
 O
The O
ground O
covered O
with O
snow, O
and O
the O
atmosphere O
in O
that O
unsettled O
state O
between O
frost O
and O
thaw, O
which O
is O
of O
all O
others O
the O
most O
unfriendly O
for O
exercise, O
every O
morning O
beginning O
in O
rain O
or O
snow, O
and O
every O
evening O
setting O
in O
to O
freeze, O
she O
was O
for O
many O
days O
a O
most O
honourable O
prisoner. O
No O
intercourse O
with O
Harriet O
possible O
but O
by O
note; O
no O
church O
for O
her O
on O
Sunday O
any O
more O
than O
on O
Christmas O
Day; O
and O
no O
need O
to O
find O
excuses O
for O
Mr. O
Elton's O
absenting O
himself. O
It O
was O
weather O
which O
might O
fairly O
confine O
every O
body O
at O
home; O
and O
though O
she O
hoped O
and O
believed O
him O
to O
be O
really O
taking O
comfort O
in O
some O
society O
or O
other, O
it O
was O
very O
pleasant O
to O
have O
her O
father O
so O
well O
satisfied O
with O
his O
being O
all O
alone O
in O
his O
own O
house, O
too O
wise O
to O
stir O
out; O
and O
to O
hear O
him O
say O
to O
Mr. O
Knightley, O
whom O
no O
weather O
could O
keep O
entirely O
from O
them,-- O
"Ah! O
 O
Mr. O
Knightley, O
why O
do O
not O
you O
stay O
at O
home O
like O
poor O
Mr. O
Elton?" O
These O
days O
of O
confinement O
would O
have O
been, O
but O
for O
her O
private O
perplexities, O
remarkably O
comfortable, O
as O
such O
seclusion O
exactly O
suited O
her O
brother, O
whose O
feelings O
must O
always O
be O
of O
great O
importance O
to O
his O
companions; O
and O
he O
had, O
besides, O
so O
thoroughly O
cleared O
off O
his O
ill-humour O
at O
Randalls, O
that O
his O
amiableness O
never O
failed O
him O
during O
the O
rest O
of O
his O
stay O
at O
Hartfield. O
 O
He O
was O
always O
agreeable O
and O
obliging, O
and O
speaking O
pleasantly O
of O
every O
body. O
 O
But O
with O
all O
the O
hopes O
of O
cheerfulness, O
and O
all O
the O
present O
comfort O
of O
delay, O
there O
was O
still O
such O
an O
evil O
hanging O
over O
her O
in O
the O
hour O
of O
explanation O
with O
Harriet, O
as O
made O
it O
impossible O
for O
Emma O
to O
be O
ever O
perfectly O
at O
ease. O
CHAPTER O
XVII O
Mr. O
and O
Mrs. O
John O
Knightley O
were O
not O
detained O
long O
at O
Hartfield. O
 O
The O
weather O
soon O
improved O
enough O
for O
those O
to O
move O
who O
must O
move; O
and O
Mr. O
Woodhouse O
having, O
as O
usual, O
tried O
to O
persuade O
his O
daughter O
to O
stay O
behind O
with O
all O
her O
children, O
was O
obliged O
to O
see O
the O
whole O
party O
set O
off, O
and O
return O
to O
his O
lamentations O
over O
the O
destiny O
of O
poor O
Isabella;-- O
which O
poor O
Isabella, O
passing O
her O
life O
with O
those O
she O
doated O
on, O
full O
of O
their O
merits, O
blind O
to O
their O
faults, O
and O
always O
innocently O
busy, O
might O
have O
been O
a O
model O
of O
right O
feminine O
happiness. O
The O
evening O
of O
the O
very O
day O
on O
which O
they O
went O
brought O
a O
note O
from O
Mr. O
Elton O
to O
Mr. O
Woodhouse, O
a O
long, O
civil, O
ceremonious O
note, O
to O
say, O
with O
Mr. O
Elton's O
best O
compliments, O
"that O
he O
was O
proposing O
to O
leave O
Highbury O
the O
following O
morning O
in O
his O
way O
to O
Bath; O
where, O
in O
compliance O
with O
the O
pressing O
entreaties O
of O
some O
friends, O
he O
had O
engaged O
to O
spend O
a O
few O
weeks, O
and O
very O
much O
regretted O
the O
impossibility O
he O
was O
under, O
from O
various O
circumstances O
of O
weather O
and O
business, O
of O
taking O
a O
personal O
leave O
of O
Mr. O
Woodhouse, O
of O
whose O
friendly O
civilities O
he O
should O
ever O
retain O
a O
grateful O
sense-- O
and O
had O
Mr. O
Woodhouse O
any O
commands, O
should O
be O
happy O
to O
attend O
to O
them." O
Emma O
was O
most O
agreeably O
surprized.-- O
Mr. O
Elton's O
absence O
just O
at O
this O
time O
was O
the O
very O
thing O
to O
be O
desired. O
 O
She O
admired O
him O
for O
contriving O
it, O
though O
not O
able O
to O
give O
him O
much O
credit O
for O
the O
manner O
in O
which O
it O
was O
announced. O
 O
Resentment O
could O
not O
have O
been O
more O
plainly O
spoken O
than O
in O
a O
civility O
to O
her O
father, O
from O
which O
she O
was O
so O
pointedly O
excluded. O
She O
had O
not O
even O
a O
share O
in O
his O
opening O
compliments.-- O
Her O
name O
was O
not O
mentioned;-- O
and O
there O
was O
so O
striking O
a O
change O
in O
all O
this, O
and O
such O
an O
ill-judged O
solemnity O
of O
leave-taking O
in O
his O
graceful O
acknowledgments, O
as O
she O
thought, O
at O
first, O
could O
not O
escape O
her O
father's O
suspicion. O
It O
did, O
however.-- O
Her O
father O
was O
quite O
taken O
up O
with O
the O
surprize O
of O
so O
sudden O
a O
journey, O
and O
his O
fears O
that O
Mr. O
Elton O
might O
never O
get O
safely O
to O
the O
end O
of O
it, O
and O
saw O
nothing O
extraordinary O
in O
his O
language. O
 O
It O
was O
a O
very O
useful O
note, O
for O
it O
supplied O
them O
with O
fresh O
matter O
for O
thought O
and O
conversation O
during O
the O
rest O
of O
their O
lonely O
evening. O
 O
Mr. O
Woodhouse O
talked O
over O
his O
alarms, O
and O
Emma O
was O
in O
spirits O
to O
persuade O
them O
away O
with O
all O
her O
usual O
promptitude. O
She O
now O
resolved O
to O
keep O
Harriet O
no O
longer O
in O
the O
dark. O
 O
She O
had O
reason O
to O
believe O
her O
nearly O
recovered O
from O
her O
cold, O
and O
it O
was O
desirable O
that O
she O
should O
have O
as O
much O
time O
as O
possible O
for O
getting O
the O
better O
of O
her O
other O
complaint O
before O
the O
gentleman's O
return. O
 O
She O
went O
to O
Mrs. O
Goddard's O
accordingly O
the O
very O
next O
day, O
to O
undergo O
the O
necessary O
penance O
of O
communication; O
and O
a O
severe O
one O
it O
was.-- O
She O
had O
to O
destroy O
all O
the O
hopes O
which O
she O
had O
been O
so O
industriously O
feeding-- O
to O
appear O
in O
the O
ungracious O
character O
of O
the O
one O
preferred-- O
and O
acknowledge O
herself O
grossly O
mistaken O
and O
mis-judging O
in O
all O
her O
ideas O
on O
one O
subject, O
all O
her O
observations, O
all O
her O
convictions, O
all O
her O
prophecies O
for O
the O
last O
six O
weeks. O
The O
confession O
completely O
renewed O
her O
first O
shame-- O
and O
the O
sight O
of O
Harriet's O
tears O
made O
her O
think O
that O
she O
should O
never O
be O
in O
charity O
with O
herself O
again. O
Harriet O
bore O
the O
intelligence O
very O
well-- O
blaming O
nobody-- O
and O
in O
every O
thing O
testifying O
such O
an O
ingenuousness O
of O
disposition O
and O
lowly O
opinion O
of O
herself, O
as O
must O
appear O
with O
particular O
advantage O
at O
that O
moment O
to O
her O
friend. O
Emma O
was O
in O
the O
humour O
to O
value O
simplicity O
and O
modesty O
to O
the O
utmost; O
and O
all O
that O
was O
amiable, O
all O
that O
ought O
to O
be O
attaching, O
seemed O
on O
Harriet's O
side, O
not O
her O
own. O
 O
Harriet O
did O
not O
consider O
herself O
as O
having O
any O
thing O
to O
complain O
of. O
 O
The O
affection O
of O
such O
a O
man O
as O
Mr. O
Elton O
would O
have O
been O
too O
great O
a O
distinction.-- O
She O
never O
could O
have O
deserved O
him-- O
and O
nobody O
but O
so O
partial O
and O
kind O
a O
friend O
as O
Miss O
Woodhouse O
would O
have O
thought O
it O
possible. O
Her O
tears O
fell O
abundantly-- O
but O
her O
grief O
was O
so O
truly O
artless, O
that O
no O
dignity O
could O
have O
made O
it O
more O
respectable O
in O
Emma's O
eyes-- O
and O
she O
listened O
to O
her O
and O
tried O
to O
console O
her O
with O
all O
her O
heart O
and O
understanding-- O
really O
for O
the O
time O
convinced O
that O
Harriet O
was O
the O
superior O
creature O
of O
the O
two-- O
and O
that O
to O
resemble O
her O
would O
be O
more O
for O
her O
own O
welfare O
and O
happiness O
than O
all O
that O
genius O
or O
intelligence O
could O
do. O
It O
was O
rather O
too O
late O
in O
the O
day O
to O
set O
about O
being O
simple-minded O
and O
ignorant; O
but O
she O
left O
her O
with O
every O
previous O
resolution O
confirmed O
of O
being O
humble O
and O
discreet, O
and O
repressing O
imagination O
all O
the O
rest O
of O
her O
life. O
 O
Her O
second O
duty O
now, O
inferior O
only O
to O
her O
father's O
claims, O
was O
to O
promote O
Harriet's O
comfort, O
and O
endeavour O
to O
prove O
her O
own O
affection O
in O
some O
better O
method O
than O
by O
match-making. O
 O
She O
got O
her O
to O
Hartfield, O
and O
shewed O
her O
the O
most O
unvarying O
kindness, O
striving O
to O
occupy O
and O
amuse O
her, O
and O
by O
books O
and O
conversation, O
to O
drive O
Mr. O
Elton O
from O
her O
thoughts. O
Time, O
she O
knew, O
must O
be O
allowed O
for O
this O
being O
thoroughly O
done; O
and O
she O
could O
suppose O
herself O
but O
an O
indifferent O
judge O
of O
such O
matters O
in O
general, O
and O
very O
inadequate O
to O
sympathise O
in O
an O
attachment O
to O
Mr. O
Elton O
in O
particular; O
but O
it O
seemed O
to O
her O
reasonable O
that O
at O
Harriet's O
age, O
and O
with O
the O
entire O
extinction O
of O
all O
hope, O
such O
a O
progress O
might O
be O
made O
towards O
a O
state O
of O
composure O
by O
the O
time O
of O
Mr. O
Elton's O
return, O
as O
to O
allow O
them O
all O
to O
meet O
again O
in O
the O
common O
routine O
of O
acquaintance, O
without O
any O
danger O
of O
betraying O
sentiments O
or O
increasing O
them. O
Harriet O
did O
think O
him O
all O
perfection, O
and O
maintained O
the O
non-existence O
of O
any O
body O
equal O
to O
him O
in O
person O
or O
goodness-- O
and O
did, O
in O
truth, O
prove O
herself O
more O
resolutely O
in O
love O
than O
Emma O
had O
foreseen; O
but O
yet O
it O
appeared O
to O
her O
so O
natural, O
so O
inevitable O
to O
strive O
against O
an O
inclination O
of O
that O
sort O
unrequited, O
that O
she O
could O
not O
comprehend O
its O
continuing O
very O
long O
in O
equal O
force. O
If O
Mr. O
Elton, O
on O
his O
return, O
made O
his O
own O
indifference O
as O
evident O
and O
indubitable O
as O
she O
could O
not O
doubt O
he O
would O
anxiously O
do, O
she O
could O
not O
imagine O
Harriet's O
persisting O
to O
place O
her O
happiness O
in O
the O
sight O
or O
the O
recollection O
of O
him. O
Their O
being O
fixed, O
so O
absolutely O
fixed, O
in O
the O
same O
place, O
was O
bad O
for O
each, O
for O
all O
three. O
 O
Not O
one O
of O
them O
had O
the O
power O
of O
removal, O
or O
of O
effecting O
any O
material O
change O
of O
society. O
 O
They O
must O
encounter O
each O
other, O
and O
make O
the O
best O
of O
it. O
Harriet O
was O
farther O
unfortunate O
in O
the O
tone O
of O
her O
companions O
at O
Mrs. O
Goddard's; O
Mr. O
Elton O
being O
the O
adoration O
of O
all O
the O
teachers O
and O
great O
girls O
in O
the O
school; O
and O
it O
must O
be O
at O
Hartfield O
only O
that O
she O
could O
have O
any O
chance O
of O
hearing O
him O
spoken O
of O
with O
cooling O
moderation O
or O
repellent O
truth. O
 O
Where O
the O
wound O
had O
been O
given, O
there O
must O
the O
cure O
be O
found O
if O
anywhere; O
and O
Emma O
felt O
that, O
till O
she O
saw O
her O
in O
the O
way O
of O
cure, O
there O
could O
be O
no O
true O
peace O
for O
herself. O
CHAPTER O
XVIII O
Mr. O
Frank O
Churchill O
did O
not O
come. O
 O
When O
the O
time O
proposed O
drew O
near, O
Mrs. O
Weston's O
fears O
were O
justified O
in O
the O
arrival O
of O
a O
letter O
of O
excuse. O
 O
For O
the O
present, O
he O
could O
not O
be O
spared, O
to O
his O
"very O
great O
mortification O
and O
regret; O
but O
still O
he O
looked O
forward O
with O
the O
hope O
of O
coming O
to O
Randalls O
at O
no O
distant O
period." O
Mrs. O
Weston O
was O
exceedingly O
disappointed-- O
much O
more O
disappointed, O
in O
fact, O
than O
her O
husband, O
though O
her O
dependence O
on O
seeing O
the O
young O
man O
had O
been O
so O
much O
more O
sober: O
 O
but O
a O
sanguine O
temper, O
though O
for O
ever O
expecting O
more O
good O
than O
occurs, O
does O
not O
always O
pay O
for O
its O
hopes O
by O
any O
proportionate O
depression. O
 O
It O
soon O
flies O
over O
the O
present O
failure, O
and O
begins O
to O
hope O
again. O
 O
For O
half O
an O
hour O
Mr. O
Weston O
was O
surprized O
and O
sorry; O
but O
then O
he O
began O
to O
perceive O
that O
Frank's O
coming O
two O
or O
three O
months O
later O
would O
be O
a O
much O
better O
plan; O
better O
time O
of O
year; O
better O
weather; O
and O
that O
he O
would O
be O
able, O
without O
any O
doubt, O
to O
stay O
considerably O
longer O
with O
them O
than O
if O
he O
had O
come O
sooner. O
These O
feelings O
rapidly O
restored O
his O
comfort, O
while O
Mrs. O
Weston, O
of O
a O
more O
apprehensive O
disposition, O
foresaw O
nothing O
but O
a O
repetition O
of O
excuses O
and O
delays; O
and O
after O
all O
her O
concern O
for O
what O
her O
husband O
was O
to O
suffer, O
suffered O
a O
great O
deal O
more O
herself. O
Emma O
was O
not O
at O
this O
time O
in O
a O
state O
of O
spirits O
to O
care O
really O
about O
Mr. O
Frank O
Churchill's O
not O
coming, O
except O
as O
a O
disappointment O
at O
Randalls. O
 O
The O
acquaintance O
at O
present O
had O
no O
charm O
for O
her. O
 O
She O
wanted, O
rather, O
to O
be O
quiet, O
and O
out O
of O
temptation; O
but O
still, O
as O
it O
was O
desirable O
that O
she O
should O
appear, O
in O
general, O
like O
her O
usual O
self, O
she O
took O
care O
to O
express O
as O
much O
interest O
in O
the O
circumstance, O
and O
enter O
as O
warmly O
into O
Mr. O
and O
Mrs. O
Weston's O
disappointment, O
as O
might O
naturally O
belong O
to O
their O
friendship. O
She O
was O
the O
first O
to O
announce O
it O
to O
Mr. O
Knightley; O
and O
exclaimed O
quite O
as O
much O
as O
was O
necessary, O
(or, O
being O
acting O
a O
part, O
perhaps O
rather O
more,) O
at O
the O
conduct O
of O
the O
Churchills, O
in O
keeping O
him O
away. O
 O
She O
then O
proceeded O
to O
say O
a O
good O
deal O
more O
than O
she O
felt, O
of O
the O
advantage O
of O
such O
an O
addition O
to O
their O
confined O
society O
in O
Surry; O
the O
pleasure O
of O
looking O
at O
somebody O
new; O
the O
gala-day O
to O
Highbury O
entire, O
which O
the O
sight O
of O
him O
would O
have O
made; O
and O
ending O
with O
reflections O
on O
the O
Churchills O
again, O
found O
herself O
directly O
involved O
in O
a O
disagreement O
with O
Mr. O
Knightley; O
and, O
to O
her O
great O
amusement, O
perceived O
that O
she O
was O
taking O
the O
other O
side O
of O
the O
question O
from O
her O
real O
opinion, O
and O
making O
use O
of O
Mrs. O
Weston's O
arguments O
against O
herself. O
"The O
Churchills O
are O
very O
likely O
in O
fault," O
said O
Mr. O
Knightley, O
coolly; O
"but O
I O
dare O
say O
he O
might O
come O
if O
he O
would." O
"I O
do O
not O
know O
why O
you O
should O
say O
so. O
 O
He O
wishes O
exceedingly O
to O
come; O
but O
his O
uncle O
and O
aunt O
will O
not O
spare O
him." O
"I O
cannot O
believe O
that O
he O
has O
not O
the O
power O
of O
coming, O
if O
he O
made O
a O
point O
of O
it. O
 O
It O
is O
too O
unlikely, O
for O
me O
to O
believe O
it O
without O
proof." O
"How O
odd O
you O
are! O
 O
What O
has O
Mr. O
Frank O
Churchill O
done, O
to O
make O
you O
suppose O
him O
such O
an O
unnatural O
creature?" O
"I O
am O
not O
supposing O
him O
at O
all O
an O
unnatural O
creature, O
in O
suspecting O
that O
he O
may O
have O
learnt O
to O
be O
above O
his O
connexions, O
and O
to O
care O
very O
little O
for O
any O
thing O
but O
his O
own O
pleasure, O
from O
living O
with O
those O
who O
have O
always O
set O
him O
the O
example O
of O
it. O
 O
It O
is O
a O
great O
deal O
more O
natural O
than O
one O
could O
wish, O
that O
a O
young O
man, O
brought O
up O
by O
those O
who O
are O
proud, O
luxurious, O
and O
selfish, O
should O
be O
proud, O
luxurious, O
and O
selfish O
too. O
 O
If O
Frank O
Churchill O
had O
wanted O
to O
see O
his O
father, O
he O
would O
have O
contrived O
it O
between O
September O
and O
January. O
 O
A O
man O
at O
his O
age-- O
what O
is O
he?-- O
three O
or O
four-and-twenty-- O
cannot O
be O
without O
the O
means O
of O
doing O
as O
much O
as O
that. O
 O
It O
is O
impossible." O
"That's O
easily O
said, O
and O
easily O
felt O
by O
you, O
who O
have O
always O
been O
your O
own O
master. O
 O
You O
are O
the O
worst O
judge O
in O
the O
world, O
Mr. O
Knightley, O
of O
the O
difficulties O
of O
dependence. O
 O
You O
do O
not O
know O
what O
it O
is O
to O
have O
tempers O
to O
manage." O
"It O
is O
not O
to O
be O
conceived O
that O
a O
man O
of O
three O
or O
four-and-twenty O
should O
not O
have O
liberty O
of O
mind O
or O
limb O
to O
that O
amount. O
 O
He O
cannot O
want O
money-- O
he O
cannot O
want O
leisure. O
 O
We O
know, O
on O
the O
contrary, O
that O
he O
has O
so O
much O
of O
both, O
that O
he O
is O
glad O
to O
get O
rid O
of O
them O
at O
the O
idlest O
haunts O
in O
the O
kingdom. O
 O
We O
hear O
of O
him O
for O
ever O
at O
some O
watering-place O
or O
other. O
 O
A O
little O
while O
ago, O
he O
was O
at O
Weymouth. O
 O
This O
proves O
that O
he O
can O
leave O
the O
Churchills." O
"Yes, O
sometimes O
he O
can." O
"And O
those O
times O
are O
whenever O
he O
thinks O
it O
worth O
his O
while; O
whenever O
there O
is O
any O
temptation O
of O
pleasure." O
"It O
is O
very O
unfair O
to O
judge O
of O
any O
body's O
conduct, O
without O
an O
intimate O
knowledge O
of O
their O
situation. O
 O
Nobody, O
who O
has O
not O
been O
in O
the O
interior O
of O
a O
family, O
can O
say O
what O
the O
difficulties O
of O
any O
individual O
of O
that O
family O
may O
be. O
 O
We O
ought O
to O
be O
acquainted O
with O
Enscombe, O
and O
with O
Mrs. O
Churchill's O
temper, O
before O
we O
pretend O
to O
decide O
upon O
what O
her O
nephew O
can O
do. O
 O
He O
may, O
at O
times, O
be O
able O
to O
do O
a O
great O
deal O
more O
than O
he O
can O
at O
others." O
"There O
is O
one O
thing, O
Emma, O
which O
a O
man O
can O
always O
do, O
if O
he O
chuses, O
and O
that O
is, O
his O
duty; O
not O
by O
manoeuvring O
and O
finessing, O
but O
by O
vigour O
and O
resolution. O
 O
It O
is O
Frank O
Churchill's O
duty O
to O
pay O
this O
attention O
to O
his O
father. O
 O
He O
knows O
it O
to O
be O
so, O
by O
his O
promises O
and O
messages; O
but O
if O
he O
wished O
to O
do O
it, O
it O
might O
be O
done. O
 O
A O
man O
who O
felt O
rightly O
would O
say O
at O
once, O
simply O
and O
resolutely, O
to O
Mrs. O
Churchill-- O
'Every O
sacrifice O
of O
mere O
pleasure O
you O
will O
always O
find O
me O
ready O
to O
make O
to O
your O
convenience; O
but O
I O
must O
go O
and O
see O
my O
father O
immediately. O
 O
I O
know O
he O
would O
be O
hurt O
by O
my O
failing O
in O
such O
a O
mark O
of O
respect O
to O
him O
on O
the O
present O
occasion. O
 O
I O
shall, O
therefore, O
set O
off O
to-morrow.'-- O
If O
he O
would O
say O
so O
to O
her O
at O
once, O
in O
the O
tone O
of O
decision O
becoming O
a O
man, O
there O
would O
be O
no O
opposition O
made O
to O
his O
going." O
"No," O
said O
Emma, O
laughing; O
"but O
perhaps O
there O
might O
be O
some O
made O
to O
his O
coming O
back O
again. O
 O
Such O
language O
for O
a O
young O
man O
entirely O
dependent, O
to O
use!-- O
Nobody O
but O
you, O
Mr. O
Knightley, O
would O
imagine O
it O
possible. O
 O
But O
you O
have O
not O
an O
idea O
of O
what O
is O
requisite O
in O
situations O
directly O
opposite O
to O
your O
own. O
 O
Mr. O
Frank O
Churchill O
to O
be O
making O
such O
a O
speech O
as O
that O
to O
the O
uncle O
and O
aunt, O
who O
have O
brought O
him O
up, O
and O
are O
to O
provide O
for O
him!-- O
Standing O
up O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
room, O
I O
suppose, O
and O
speaking O
as O
loud O
as O
he O
could!-- O
How O
can O
you O
imagine O
such O
conduct O
practicable?" O
"Depend O
upon O
it, O
Emma, O
a O
sensible O
man O
would O
find O
no O
difficulty O
in O
it. O
He O
would O
feel O
himself O
in O
the O
right; O
and O
the O
declaration-- O
made, O
of O
course, O
as O
a O
man O
of O
sense O
would O
make O
it, O
in O
a O
proper O
manner-- O
would O
do O
him O
more O
good, O
raise O
him O
higher, O
fix O
his O
interest O
stronger O
with O
the O
people O
he O
depended O
on, O
than O
all O
that O
a O
line O
of O
shifts O
and O
expedients O
can O
ever O
do. O
 O
Respect O
would O
be O
added O
to O
affection. O
 O
They O
would O
feel O
that O
they O
could O
trust O
him; O
that O
the O
nephew O
who O
had O
done O
rightly O
by O
his O
father, O
would O
do O
rightly O
by O
them; O
for O
they O
know, O
as O
well O
as O
he O
does, O
as O
well O
as O
all O
the O
world O
must O
know, O
that O
he O
ought O
to O
pay O
this O
visit O
to O
his O
father; O
and O
while O
meanly O
exerting O
their O
power O
to O
delay O
it, O
are O
in O
their O
hearts O
not O
thinking O
the O
better O
of O
him O
for O
submitting O
to O
their O
whims. O
Respect O
for O
right O
conduct O
is O
felt O
by O
every O
body. O
 O
If O
he O
would O
act O
in O
this O
sort O
of O
manner, O
on O
principle, O
consistently, O
regularly, O
their O
little O
minds O
would O
bend O
to O
his." O
"I O
rather O
doubt O
that. O
 O
You O
are O
very O
fond O
of O
bending O
little O
minds; O
but O
where O
little O
minds O
belong O
to O
rich O
people O
in O
authority, O
I O
think O
they O
have O
a O
knack O
of O
swelling O
out, O
till O
they O
are O
quite O
as O
unmanageable O
as O
great O
ones. O
 O
I O
can O
imagine, O
that O
if O
you, O
as O
you O
are, O
Mr. O
Knightley, O
were O
to O
be O
transported O
and O
placed O
all O
at O
once O
in O
Mr. O
Frank O
Churchill's O
situation, O
you O
would O
be O
able O
to O
say O
and O
do O
just O
what O
you O
have O
been O
recommending O
for O
him; O
and O
it O
might O
have O
a O
very O
good O
effect. O
 O
The O
Churchills O
might O
not O
have O
a O
word O
to O
say O
in O
return; O
but O
then, O
you O
would O
have O
no O
habits O
of O
early O
obedience O
and O
long O
observance O
to O
break O
through. O
To O
him O
who O
has, O
it O
might O
not O
be O
so O
easy O
to O
burst O
forth O
at O
once O
into O
perfect O
independence, O
and O
set O
all O
their O
claims O
on O
his O
gratitude O
and O
regard O
at O
nought. O
 O
He O
may O
have O
as O
strong O
a O
sense O
of O
what O
would O
be O
right, O
as O
you O
can O
have, O
without O
being O
so O
equal, O
under O
particular O
circumstances, O
to O
act O
up O
to O
it." O
"Then O
it O
would O
not O
be O
so O
strong O
a O
sense. O
 O
If O
it O
failed O
to O
produce O
equal O
exertion, O
it O
could O
not O
be O
an O
equal O
conviction." O
"Oh, O
the O
difference O
of O
situation O
and O
habit! O
 O
I O
wish O
you O
would O
try O
to O
understand O
what O
an O
amiable O
young O
man O
may O
be O
likely O
to O
feel O
in O
directly O
opposing O
those, O
whom O
as O
child O
and O
boy O
he O
has O
been O
looking O
up O
to O
all O
his O
life." O
"Our O
amiable O
young O
man O
is O
a O
very O
weak O
young O
man, O
if O
this O
be O
the O
first O
occasion O
of O
his O
carrying O
through O
a O
resolution O
to O
do O
right O
against O
the O
will O
of O
others. O
 O
It O
ought O
to O
have O
been O
a O
habit O
with O
him O
by O
this O
time, O
of O
following O
his O
duty, O
instead O
of O
consulting O
expediency. O
 O
I O
can O
allow O
for O
the O
fears O
of O
the O
child, O
but O
not O
of O
the O
man. O
 O
As O
he O
became O
rational, O
he O
ought O
to O
have O
roused O
himself O
and O
shaken O
off O
all O
that O
was O
unworthy O
in O
their O
authority. O
 O
He O
ought O
to O
have O
opposed O
the O
first O
attempt O
on O
their O
side O
to O
make O
him O
slight O
his O
father. O
 O
Had O
he O
begun O
as O
he O
ought, O
there O
would O
have O
been O
no O
difficulty O
now." O
"We O
shall O
never O
agree O
about O
him," O
cried O
Emma; O
"but O
that O
is O
nothing O
extraordinary. O
 O
I O
have O
not O
the O
least O
idea O
of O
his O
being O
a O
weak O
young O
man: O
 O
I O
feel O
sure O
that O
he O
is O
not. O
 O
Mr. O
Weston O
would O
not O
be O
blind O
to O
folly, O
though O
in O
his O
own O
son; O
but O
he O
is O
very O
likely O
to O
have O
a O
more O
yielding, O
complying, O
mild O
disposition O
than O
would O
suit O
your O
notions O
of O
man's O
perfection. O
 O
I O
dare O
say O
he O
has; O
and O
though O
it O
may O
cut O
him O
off O
from O
some O
advantages, O
it O
will O
secure O
him O
many O
others." O
"Yes; O
all O
the O
advantages O
of O
sitting O
still O
when O
he O
ought O
to O
move, O
and O
of O
leading O
a O
life O
of O
mere O
idle O
pleasure, O
and O
fancying O
himself O
extremely O
expert O
in O
finding O
excuses O
for O
it. O
 O
He O
can O
sit O
down O
and O
write O
a O
fine O
flourishing O
letter, O
full O
of O
professions O
and O
falsehoods, O
and O
persuade O
himself O
that O
he O
has O
hit O
upon O
the O
very O
best O
method O
in O
the O
world O
of O
preserving O
peace O
at O
home O
and O
preventing O
his O
father's O
having O
any O
right O
to O
complain. O
 O
His O
letters O
disgust O
me." O
"Your O
feelings O
are O
singular. O
 O
They O
seem O
to O
satisfy O
every O
body O
else." O
"I O
suspect O
they O
do O
not O
satisfy O
Mrs. O
Weston. O
 O
They O
hardly O
can O
satisfy O
a O
woman O
of O
her O
good O
sense O
and O
quick O
feelings: O
 O
standing O
in O
a O
mother's O
place, O
but O
without O
a O
mother's O
affection O
to O
blind O
her. O
 O
It O
is O
on O
her O
account O
that O
attention O
to O
Randalls O
is O
doubly O
due, O
and O
she O
must O
doubly O
feel O
the O
omission. O
 O
Had O
she O
been O
a O
person O
of O
consequence O
herself, O
he O
would O
have O
come O
I O
dare O
say; O
and O
it O
would O
not O
have O
signified O
whether O
he O
did O
or O
no. O
 O
Can O
you O
think O
your O
friend O
behindhand O
in O
these O
sort O
of O
considerations? O
 O
Do O
you O
suppose O
she O
does O
not O
often O
say O
all O
this O
to O
herself? O
 O
No, O
Emma, O
your O
amiable O
young O
man O
can O
be O
amiable O
only O
in O
French, O
not O
in O
English. O
 O
He O
may O
be O
very O
'aimable,' O
have O
very O
good O
manners, O
and O
be O
very O
agreeable; O
but O
he O
can O
have O
no O
English O
delicacy O
towards O
the O
feelings O
of O
other O
people: O
nothing O
really O
amiable O
about O
him." O
"You O
seem O
determined O
to O
think O
ill O
of O
him." O
"Me!-- O
not O
at O
all," O
replied O
Mr. O
Knightley, O
rather O
displeased; O
"I O
do O
not O
want O
to O
think O
ill O
of O
him. O
 O
I O
should O
be O
as O
ready O
to O
acknowledge O
his O
merits O
as O
any O
other O
man; O
but O
I O
hear O
of O
none, O
except O
what O
are O
merely O
personal; O
that O
he O
is O
well-grown O
and O
good-looking, O
with O
smooth, O
plausible O
manners." O
"Well, O
if O
he O
have O
nothing O
else O
to O
recommend O
him, O
he O
will O
be O
a O
treasure O
at O
Highbury. O
 O
We O
do O
not O
often O
look O
upon O
fine O
young O
men, O
well-bred O
and O
agreeable. O
 O
We O
must O
not O
be O
nice O
and O
ask O
for O
all O
the O
virtues O
into O
the O
bargain. O
 O
Cannot O
you O
imagine, O
Mr. O
Knightley, O
what O
a O
sensation O
his O
coming O
will O
produce? O
 O
There O
will O
be O
but O
one O
subject O
throughout O
the O
parishes O
of O
Donwell O
and O
Highbury; O
but O
one O
interest-- O
one O
object O
of O
curiosity; O
it O
will O
be O
all O
Mr. O
Frank O
Churchill; O
we O
shall O
think O
and O
speak O
of O
nobody O
else." O
"You O
will O
excuse O
my O
being O
so O
much O
over-powered. O
If O
I O
find O
him O
conversable, O
I O
shall O
be O
glad O
of O
his O
acquaintance; O
but O
if O
he O
is O
only O
a O
chattering O
coxcomb, O
he O
will O
not O
occupy O
much O
of O
my O
time O
or O
thoughts." O
"My O
idea O
of O
him O
is, O
that O
he O
can O
adapt O
his O
conversation O
to O
the O
taste O
of O
every O
body, O
and O
has O
the O
power O
as O
well O
as O
the O
wish O
of O
being O
universally O
agreeable. O
 O
To O
you, O
he O
will O
talk O
of O
farming; O
to O
me, O
of O
drawing O
or O
music; O
and O
so O
on O
to O
every O
body, O
having O
that O
general O
information O
on O
all O
subjects O
which O
will O
enable O
him O
to O
follow O
the O
lead, O
or O
take O
the O
lead, O
just O
as O
propriety O
may O
require, O
and O
to O
speak O
extremely O
well O
on O
each; O
that O
is O
my O
idea O
of O
him." O
"And O
mine," O
said O
Mr. O
Knightley O
warmly, O
"is, O
that O
if O
he O
turn O
out O
any O
thing O
like O
it, O
he O
will O
be O
the O
most O
insufferable O
fellow O
breathing! O
What! O
at O
three-and-twenty O
to O
be O
the O
king O
of O
his O
company-- O
the O
great O
man-- O
the O
practised O
politician, O
who O
is O
to O
read O
every O
body's O
character, O
and O
make O
every O
body's O
talents O
conduce O
to O
the O
display O
of O
his O
own O
superiority; O
to O
be O
dispensing O
his O
flatteries O
around, O
that O
he O
may O
make O
all O
appear O
like O
fools O
compared O
with O
himself! O
 O
My O
dear O
Emma, O
your O
own O
good O
sense O
could O
not O
endure O
such O
a O
puppy O
when O
it O
came O
to O
the O
point." O
"I O
will O
say O
no O
more O
about O
him," O
cried O
Emma, O
"you O
turn O
every O
thing O
to O
evil. O
 O
We O
are O
both O
prejudiced; O
you O
against, O
I O
for O
him; O
and O
we O
have O
no O
chance O
of O
agreeing O
till O
he O
is O
really O
here." O
"Prejudiced! O
 O
I O
am O
not O
prejudiced." O
"But O
I O
am O
very O
much, O
and O
without O
being O
at O
all O
ashamed O
of O
it. O
 O
My O
love O
for O
Mr. O
and O
Mrs. O
Weston O
gives O
me O
a O
decided O
prejudice O
in O
his O
favour." O
"He O
is O
a O
person O
I O
never O
think O
of O
from O
one O
month's O
end O
to O
another," O
said O
Mr. O
Knightley, O
with O
a O
degree O
of O
vexation, O
which O
made O
Emma O
immediately O
talk O
of O
something O
else, O
though O
she O
could O
not O
comprehend O
why O
he O
should O
be O
angry. O
To O
take O
a O
dislike O
to O
a O
young O
man, O
only O
because O
he O
appeared O
to O
be O
of O
a O
different O
disposition O
from O
himself, O
was O
unworthy O
the O
real O
liberality O
of O
mind O
which O
she O
was O
always O
used O
to O
acknowledge O
in O
him; O
for O
with O
all O
the O
high O
opinion O
of O
himself, O
which O
she O
had O
often O
laid O
to O
his O
charge, O
she O
had O
never O
before O
for O
a O
moment O
supposed O
it O
could O
make O
him O
unjust O
to O
the O
merit O
of O
another. O
VOLUME O
II O
CHAPTER O
I O
Emma O
and O
Harriet O
had O
been O
walking O
together O
one O
morning, O
and, O
in O
Emma's O
opinion, O
had O
been O
talking O
enough O
of O
Mr. O
Elton O
for O
that O
day. O
 O
She O
could O
not O
think O
that O
Harriet's O
solace O
or O
her O
own O
sins O
required O
more; O
and O
she O
was O
therefore O
industriously O
getting O
rid O
of O
the O
subject O
as O
they O
returned;-- O
but O
it O
burst O
out O
again O
when O
she O
thought O
she O
had O
succeeded, O
and O
after O
speaking O
some O
time O
of O
what O
the O
poor O
must O
suffer O
in O
winter, O
and O
receiving O
no O
other O
answer O
than O
a O
very O
plaintive-- O
"Mr. O
Elton O
is O
so O
good O
to O
the O
poor!" O
she O
found O
something O
else O
must O
be O
done. O
They O
were O
just O
approaching O
the O
house O
where O
lived O
Mrs. O
and O
Miss O
Bates. O
She O
determined O
to O
call O
upon O
them O
and O
seek O
safety O
in O
numbers. O
 O
There O
was O
always O
sufficient O
reason O
for O
such O
an O
attention; O
Mrs. O
and O
Miss O
Bates O
loved O
to O
be O
called O
on, O
and O
she O
knew O
she O
was O
considered O
by O
the O
very O
few O
who O
presumed O
ever O
to O
see O
imperfection O
in O
her, O
as O
rather O
negligent O
in O
that O
respect, O
and O
as O
not O
contributing O
what O
she O
ought O
to O
the O
stock O
of O
their O
scanty O
comforts. O
She O
had O
had O
many O
a O
hint O
from O
Mr. O
Knightley O
and O
some O
from O
her O
own O
heart, O
as O
to O
her O
deficiency-- O
but O
none O
were O
equal O
to O
counteract O
the O
persuasion O
of O
its O
being O
very O
disagreeable, O
-- O
a O
waste O
of O
time-- O
tiresome O
women-- O
and O
all O
the O
horror O
of O
being O
in O
danger O
of O
falling O
in O
with O
the O
second-rate O
and O
third-rate O
of O
Highbury, O
who O
were O
calling O
on O
them O
for O
ever, O
and O
therefore O
she O
seldom O
went O
near O
them. O
 O
But O
now O
she O
made O
the O
sudden O
resolution O
of O
not O
passing O
their O
door O
without O
going O
in-- O
observing, O
as O
she O
proposed O
it O
to O
Harriet, O
that, O
as O
well O
as O
she O
could O
calculate, O
they O
were O
just O
now O
quite O
safe O
from O
any O
letter O
from O
Jane O
Fairfax. O
The O
house O
belonged O
to O
people O
in O
business. O
 O
Mrs. O
and O
Miss O
Bates O
occupied O
the O
drawing-room O
floor; O
and O
there, O
in O
the O
very O
moderate-sized O
apartment, O
which O
was O
every O
thing O
to O
them, O
the O
visitors O
were O
most O
cordially O
and O
even O
gratefully O
welcomed; O
the O
quiet O
neat O
old O
lady, O
who O
with O
her O
knitting O
was O
seated O
in O
the O
warmest O
corner, O
wanting O
even O
to O
give O
up O
her O
place O
to O
Miss O
Woodhouse, O
and O
her O
more O
active, O
talking O
daughter, O
almost O
ready O
to O
overpower O
them O
with O
care O
and O
kindness, O
thanks O
for O
their O
visit, O
solicitude O
for O
their O
shoes, O
anxious O
inquiries O
after O
Mr. O
Woodhouse's O
health, O
cheerful O
communications O
about O
her O
mother's, O
and O
sweet-cake O
from O
the O
beaufet-- O
"Mrs. O
Cole O
had O
just O
been O
there, O
just O
called O
in O
for O
ten O
minutes, O
and O
had O
been O
so O
good O
as O
to O
sit O
an O
hour O
with O
them, O
and O
she O
had O
taken O
a O
piece O
of O
cake O
and O
been O
so O
kind O
as O
to O
say O
she O
liked O
it O
very O
much; O
and, O
therefore, O
she O
hoped O
Miss O
Woodhouse O
and O
Miss O
Smith O
would O
do O
them O
the O
favour O
to O
eat O
a O
piece O
too." O
The O
mention O
of O
the O
Coles O
was O
sure O
to O
be O
followed O
by O
that O
of O
Mr. O
Elton. O
There O
was O
intimacy O
between O
them, O
and O
Mr. O
Cole O
had O
heard O
from O
Mr. O
Elton O
since O
his O
going O
away. O
 O
Emma O
knew O
what O
was O
coming; O
they O
must O
have O
the O
letter O
over O
again, O
and O
settle O
how O
long O
he O
had O
been O
gone, O
and O
how O
much O
he O
was O
engaged O
in O
company, O
and O
what O
a O
favourite O
he O
was O
wherever O
he O
went, O
and O
how O
full O
the O
Master O
of O
the O
Ceremonies' O
ball O
had O
been; O
and O
she O
went O
through O
it O
very O
well, O
with O
all O
the O
interest O
and O
all O
the O
commendation O
that O
could O
be O
requisite, O
and O
always O
putting O
forward O
to O
prevent O
Harriet's O
being O
obliged O
to O
say O
a O
word. O
This O
she O
had O
been O
prepared O
for O
when O
she O
entered O
the O
house; O
but O
meant, O
having O
once O
talked O
him O
handsomely O
over, O
to O
be O
no O
farther O
incommoded O
by O
any O
troublesome O
topic, O
and O
to O
wander O
at O
large O
amongst O
all O
the O
Mistresses O
and O
Misses O
of O
Highbury, O
and O
their O
card-parties. O
 O
She O
had O
not O
been O
prepared O
to O
have O
Jane O
Fairfax O
succeed O
Mr. O
Elton; O
but O
he O
was O
actually O
hurried O
off O
by O
Miss O
Bates, O
she O
jumped O
away O
from O
him O
at O
last O
abruptly O
to O
the O
Coles, O
to O
usher O
in O
a O
letter O
from O
her O
niece. O
"Oh! O
yes-- O
Mr. O
Elton, O
I O
understand-- O
certainly O
as O
to O
dancing-- O
Mrs. O
Cole O
was O
telling O
me O
that O
dancing O
at O
the O
rooms O
at O
Bath O
was-- O
Mrs. O
Cole O
was O
so O
kind O
as O
to O
sit O
some O
time O
with O
us, O
talking O
of O
Jane; O
for O
as O
soon O
as O
she O
came O
in, O
she O
began O
inquiring O
after O
her, O
Jane O
is O
so O
very O
great O
a O
favourite O
there. O
 O
Whenever O
she O
is O
with O
us, O
Mrs. O
Cole O
does O
not O
know O
how O
to O
shew O
her O
kindness O
enough; O
and O
I O
must O
say O
that O
Jane O
deserves O
it O
as O
much O
as O
any O
body O
can. O
 O
And O
so O
she O
began O
inquiring O
after O
her O
directly, O
saying, O
'I O
know O
you O
cannot O
have O
heard O
from O
Jane O
lately, O
because O
it O
is O
not O
her O
time O
for O
writing;' O
and O
when O
I O
immediately O
said, O
'But O
indeed O
we O
have, O
we O
had O
a O
letter O
this O
very O
morning,' O
I O
do O
not O
know O
that O
I O
ever O
saw O
any O
body O
more O
surprized. O
 O
'Have O
you, O
upon O
your O
honour?' O
said O
she; O
'well, O
that O
is O
quite O
unexpected. O
 O
Do O
let O
me O
hear O
what O
she O
says.'" O
Emma's O
politeness O
was O
at O
hand O
directly, O
to O
say, O
with O
smiling O
interest-- O
"Have O
you O
heard O
from O
Miss O
Fairfax O
so O
lately? O
 O
I O
am O
extremely O
happy. O
 O
I O
hope O
she O
is O
well?" O
"Thank O
you. O
 O
You O
are O
so O
kind!" O
replied O
the O
happily O
deceived O
aunt, O
while O
eagerly O
hunting O
for O
the O
letter.-- O
"Oh! O
here O
it O
is. O
 O
I O
was O
sure O
it O
could O
not O
be O
far O
off; O
but O
I O
had O
put O
my O
huswife O
upon O
it, O
you O
see, O
without O
being O
aware, O
and O
so O
it O
was O
quite O
hid, O
but O
I O
had O
it O
in O
my O
hand O
so O
very O
lately O
that O
I O
was O
almost O
sure O
it O
must O
be O
on O
the O
table. O
 O
I O
was O
reading O
it O
to O
Mrs. O
Cole, O
and O
since O
she O
went O
away, O
I O
was O
reading O
it O
again O
to O
my O
mother, O
for O
it O
is O
such O
a O
pleasure O
to O
her O
-- O
a O
letter O
from O
Jane-- O
that O
she O
can O
never O
hear O
it O
often O
enough; O
so O
I O
knew O
it O
could O
not O
be O
far O
off, O
and O
here O
it O
is, O
only O
just O
under O
my O
huswife-- O
and O
since O
you O
are O
so O
kind O
as O
to O
wish O
to O
hear O
what O
she O
says;-- O
but, O
first O
of O
all, O
I O
really O
must, O
in O
justice O
to O
Jane, O
apologise O
for O
her O
writing O
so O
short O
a O
letter-- O
only O
two O
pages O
you O
see-- O
hardly O
two-- O
and O
in O
general O
she O
fills O
the O
whole O
paper O
and O
crosses O
half. O
 O
My O
mother O
often O
wonders O
that O
I O
can O
make O
it O
out O
so O
well. O
 O
She O
often O
says, O
when O
the O
letter O
is O
first O
opened, O
'Well, O
Hetty, O
now O
I O
think O
you O
will O
be O
put O
to O
it O
to O
make O
out O
all O
that O
checker-work'-- O
don't O
you, O
ma'am?-- O
And O
then O
I O
tell O
her, O
I O
am O
sure O
she O
would O
contrive O
to O
make O
it O
out O
herself, O
if O
she O
had O
nobody O
to O
do O
it O
for O
her-- O
every O
word O
of O
it O
-- O
I O
am O
sure O
she O
would O
pore O
over O
it O
till O
she O
had O
made O
out O
every O
word. O
And, O
indeed, O
though O
my O
mother's O
eyes O
are O
not O
so O
good O
as O
they O
were, O
she O
can O
see O
amazingly O
well O
still, O
thank O
God! O
 O
with O
the O
help O
of O
spectacles. O
It O
is O
such O
a O
blessing! O
 O
My O
mother's O
are O
really O
very O
good O
indeed. O
 O
Jane O
often O
says, O
when O
she O
is O
here, O
'I O
am O
sure, O
grandmama, O
you O
must O
have O
had O
very O
strong O
eyes O
to O
see O
as O
you O
do-- O
and O
so O
much O
fine O
work O
as O
you O
have O
done O
too! O
-- O
I O
only O
wish O
my O
eyes O
may O
last O
me O
as O
well.'" O
All O
this O
spoken O
extremely O
fast O
obliged O
Miss O
Bates O
to O
stop O
for O
breath; O
and O
Emma O
said O
something O
very O
civil O
about O
the O
excellence O
of O
Miss O
Fairfax's O
handwriting. O
"You O
are O
extremely O
kind," O
replied O
Miss O
Bates, O
highly O
gratified; O
"you O
who O
are O
such O
a O
judge, O
and O
write O
so O
beautifully O
yourself. O
 O
I O
am O
sure O
there O
is O
nobody's O
praise O
that O
could O
give O
us O
so O
much O
pleasure O
as O
Miss O
Woodhouse's. O
My O
mother O
does O
not O
hear; O
she O
is O
a O
little O
deaf O
you O
know. O
Ma'am," O
addressing O
her, O
"do O
you O
hear O
what O
Miss O
Woodhouse O
is O
so O
obliging O
to O
say O
about O
Jane's O
handwriting?" O
And O
Emma O
had O
the O
advantage O
of O
hearing O
her O
own O
silly O
compliment O
repeated O
twice O
over O
before O
the O
good O
old O
lady O
could O
comprehend O
it. O
 O
She O
was O
pondering, O
in O
the O
meanwhile, O
upon O
the O
possibility, O
without O
seeming O
very O
rude, O
of O
making O
her O
escape O
from O
Jane O
Fairfax's O
letter, O
and O
had O
almost O
resolved O
on O
hurrying O
away O
directly O
under O
some O
slight O
excuse, O
when O
Miss O
Bates O
turned O
to O
her O
again O
and O
seized O
her O
attention. O
"My O
mother's O
deafness O
is O
very O
trifling O
you O
see-- O
just O
nothing O
at O
all. O
By O
only O
raising O
my O
voice, O
and O
saying O
any O
thing O
two O
or O
three O
times O
over, O
she O
is O
sure O
to O
hear; O
but O
then O
she O
is O
used O
to O
my O
voice. O
 O
But O
it O
is O
very O
remarkable O
that O
she O
should O
always O
hear O
Jane O
better O
than O
she O
does O
me. O
Jane O
speaks O
so O
distinct! O
 O
However, O
she O
will O
not O
find O
her O
grandmama O
at O
all O
deafer O
than O
she O
was O
two O
years O
ago; O
which O
is O
saying O
a O
great O
deal O
at O
my O
mother's O
time O
of O
life-- O
and O
it O
really O
is O
full O
two O
years, O
you O
know, O
since O
she O
was O
here. O
 O
We O
never O
were O
so O
long O
without O
seeing O
her O
before, O
and O
as O
I O
was O
telling O
Mrs. O
Cole, O
we O
shall O
hardly O
know O
how O
to O
make O
enough O
of O
her O
now." O
"Are O
you O
expecting O
Miss O
Fairfax O
here O
soon?" O
"Oh O
yes; O
next O
week." O
"Indeed!-- O
that O
must O
be O
a O
very O
great O
pleasure." O
"Thank O
you. O
 O
You O
are O
very O
kind. O
 O
Yes, O
next O
week. O
 O
Every O
body O
is O
so O
surprized; O
and O
every O
body O
says O
the O
same O
obliging O
things. O
 O
I O
am O
sure O
she O
will O
be O
as O
happy O
to O
see O
her O
friends O
at O
Highbury, O
as O
they O
can O
be O
to O
see O
her. O
 O
Yes, O
Friday O
or O
Saturday; O
she O
cannot O
say O
which, O
because O
Colonel O
Campbell O
will O
be O
wanting O
the O
carriage O
himself O
one O
of O
those O
days. O
 O
So O
very O
good O
of O
them O
to O
send O
her O
the O
whole O
way! O
 O
But O
they O
always O
do, O
you O
know. O
 O
Oh O
yes, O
Friday O
or O
Saturday O
next. O
 O
That O
is O
what O
she O
writes O
about. O
That O
is O
the O
reason O
of O
her O
writing O
out O
of O
rule, O
as O
we O
call O
it; O
for, O
in O
the O
common O
course, O
we O
should O
not O
have O
heard O
from O
her O
before O
next O
Tuesday O
or O
Wednesday." O
"Yes, O
so O
I O
imagined. O
 O
I O
was O
afraid O
there O
could O
be O
little O
chance O
of O
my O
hearing O
any O
thing O
of O
Miss O
Fairfax O
to-day." O
"So O
obliging O
of O
you! O
 O
No, O
we O
should O
not O
have O
heard, O
if O
it O
had O
not O
been O
for O
this O
particular O
circumstance, O
of O
her O
being O
to O
come O
here O
so O
soon. O
My O
mother O
is O
so O
delighted!-- O
for O
she O
is O
to O
be O
three O
months O
with O
us O
at O
least. O
 O
Three O
months, O
she O
says O
so, O
positively, O
as O
I O
am O
going O
to O
have O
the O
pleasure O
of O
reading O
to O
you. O
 O
The O
case O
is, O
you O
see, O
that O
the O
Campbells O
are O
going O
to O
Ireland. O
 O
Mrs. O
Dixon O
has O
persuaded O
her O
father O
and O
mother O
to O
come O
over O
and O
see O
her O
directly. O
 O
They O
had O
not O
intended O
to O
go O
over O
till O
the O
summer, O
but O
she O
is O
so O
impatient O
to O
see O
them O
again-- O
for O
till O
she O
married, O
last O
October, O
she O
was O
never O
away O
from O
them O
so O
much O
as O
a O
week, O
which O
must O
make O
it O
very O
strange O
to O
be O
in O
different O
kingdoms, O
I O
was O
going O
to O
say, O
but O
however O
different O
countries, O
and O
so O
she O
wrote O
a O
very O
urgent O
letter O
to O
her O
mother-- O
or O
her O
father, O
I O
declare O
I O
do O
not O
know O
which O
it O
was, O
but O
we O
shall O
see O
presently O
in O
Jane's O
letter-- O
wrote O
in O
Mr. O
Dixon's O
name O
as O
well O
as O
her O
own, O
to O
press O
their O
coming O
over O
directly, O
and O
they O
would O
give O
them O
the O
meeting O
in O
Dublin, O
and O
take O
them O
back O
to O
their O
country O
seat, O
Baly-craig, O
a O
beautiful O
place, O
I O
fancy. O
Jane O
has O
heard O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
its O
beauty; O
from O
Mr. O
Dixon, O
I O
mean-- O
I O
do O
not O
know O
that O
she O
ever O
heard O
about O
it O
from O
any O
body O
else; O
but O
it O
was O
very O
natural, O
you O
know, O
that O
he O
should O
like O
to O
speak O
of O
his O
own O
place O
while O
he O
was O
paying O
his O
addresses-- O
and O
as O
Jane O
used O
to O
be O
very O
often O
walking O
out O
with O
them-- O
for O
Colonel O
and O
Mrs. O
Campbell O
were O
very O
particular O
about O
their O
daughter's O
not O
walking O
out O
often O
with O
only O
Mr. O
Dixon, O
for O
which O
I O
do O
not O
at O
all O
blame O
them; O
of O
course O
she O
heard O
every O
thing O
he O
might O
be O
telling O
Miss O
Campbell O
about O
his O
own O
home O
in O
Ireland; O
and O
I O
think O
she O
wrote O
us O
word O
that O
he O
had O
shewn O
them O
some O
drawings O
of O
the O
place, O
views O
that O
he O
had O
taken O
himself. O
 O
He O
is O
a O
most O
amiable, O
charming O
young O
man, O
I O
believe. O
 O
Jane O
was O
quite O
longing O
to O
go O
to O
Ireland, O
from O
his O
account O
of O
things." O
At O
this O
moment, O
an O
ingenious O
and O
animating O
suspicion O
entering O
Emma's O
brain O
with O
regard O
to O
Jane O
Fairfax, O
this O
charming O
Mr. O
Dixon, O
and O
the O
not O
going O
to O
Ireland, O
she O
said, O
with O
the O
insidious O
design O
of O
farther O
discovery, O
"You O
must O
feel O
it O
very O
fortunate O
that O
Miss O
Fairfax O
should O
be O
allowed O
to O
come O
to O
you O
at O
such O
a O
time. O
 O
Considering O
the O
very O
particular O
friendship O
between O
her O
and O
Mrs. O
Dixon, O
you O
could O
hardly O
have O
expected O
her O
to O
be O
excused O
from O
accompanying O
Colonel O
and O
Mrs. O
Campbell." O
"Very O
true, O
very O
true, O
indeed. O
 O
The O
very O
thing O
that O
we O
have O
always O
been O
rather O
afraid O
of; O
for O
we O
should O
not O
have O
liked O
to O
have O
her O
at O
such O
a O
distance O
from O
us, O
for O
months O
together-- O
not O
able O
to O
come O
if O
any O
thing O
was O
to O
happen. O
 O
But O
you O
see, O
every O
thing O
turns O
out O
for O
the O
best. O
 O
They O
want O
her O
(Mr. O
and O
Mrs. O
Dixon) O
excessively O
to O
come O
over O
with O
Colonel O
and O
Mrs. O
Campbell; O
quite O
depend O
upon O
it; O
nothing O
can O
be O
more O
kind O
or O
pressing O
than O
their O
joint O
invitation, O
Jane O
says, O
as O
you O
will O
hear O
presently; O
Mr. O
Dixon O
does O
not O
seem O
in O
the O
least O
backward O
in O
any O
attention. O
 O
He O
is O
a O
most O
charming O
young O
man. O
 O
Ever O
since O
the O
service O
he O
rendered O
Jane O
at O
Weymouth, O
when O
they O
were O
out O
in O
that O
party O
on O
the O
water, O
and O
she, O
by O
the O
sudden O
whirling O
round O
of O
something O
or O
other O
among O
the O
sails, O
would O
have O
been O
dashed O
into O
the O
sea O
at O
once, O
and O
actually O
was O
all O
but O
gone, O
if O
he O
had O
not, O
with O
the O
greatest O
presence O
of O
mind, O
caught O
hold O
of O
her O
habit-- O
(I O
can O
never O
think O
of O
it O
without O
trembling!)-- O
But O
ever O
since O
we O
had O
the O
history O
of O
that O
day, O
I O
have O
been O
so O
fond O
of O
Mr. O
Dixon!" O
"But, O
in O
spite O
of O
all O
her O
friends' O
urgency, O
and O
her O
own O
wish O
of O
seeing O
Ireland, O
Miss O
Fairfax O
prefers O
devoting O
the O
time O
to O
you O
and O
Mrs. O
Bates?" O
"Yes-- O
entirely O
her O
own O
doing, O
entirely O
her O
own O
choice; O
and O
Colonel O
and O
Mrs. O
Campbell O
think O
she O
does O
quite O
right, O
just O
what O
they O
should O
recommend; O
and O
indeed O
they O
particularly O
wish O
her O
to O
try O
her O
native O
air, O
as O
she O
has O
not O
been O
quite O
so O
well O
as O
usual O
lately." O
"I O
am O
concerned O
to O
hear O
of O
it. O
 O
I O
think O
they O
judge O
wisely. O
 O
But O
Mrs. O
Dixon O
must O
be O
very O
much O
disappointed. O
 O
Mrs. O
Dixon, O
I O
understand, O
has O
no O
remarkable O
degree O
of O
personal O
beauty; O
is O
not, O
by O
any O
means, O
to O
be O
compared O
with O
Miss O
Fairfax." O
"Oh! O
no. O
 O
You O
are O
very O
obliging O
to O
say O
such O
things-- O
but O
certainly O
not. O
There O
is O
no O
comparison O
between O
them. O
 O
Miss O
Campbell O
always O
was O
absolutely O
plain-- O
but O
extremely O
elegant O
and O
amiable." O
"Yes, O
that O
of O
course." O
"Jane O
caught O
a O
bad O
cold, O
poor O
thing! O
so O
long O
ago O
as O
the O
7th O
of O
November, O
(as O
I O
am O
going O
to O
read O
to O
you,) O
and O
has O
never O
been O
well O
since. O
 O
A O
long O
time, O
is O
not O
it, O
for O
a O
cold O
to O
hang O
upon O
her? O
 O
She O
never O
mentioned O
it O
before, O
because O
she O
would O
not O
alarm O
us. O
 O
Just O
like O
her! O
so O
considerate!-- O
But O
however, O
she O
is O
so O
far O
from O
well, O
that O
her O
kind O
friends O
the O
Campbells O
think O
she O
had O
better O
come O
home, O
and O
try O
an O
air O
that O
always O
agrees O
with O
her; O
and O
they O
have O
no O
doubt O
that O
three O
or O
four O
months O
at O
Highbury O
will O
entirely O
cure O
her-- O
and O
it O
is O
certainly O
a O
great O
deal O
better O
that O
she O
should O
come O
here, O
than O
go O
to O
Ireland, O
if O
she O
is O
unwell. O
Nobody O
could O
nurse O
her, O
as O
we O
should O
do." O
"It O
appears O
to O
me O
the O
most O
desirable O
arrangement O
in O
the O
world." O
"And O
so O
she O
is O
to O
come O
to O
us O
next O
Friday O
or O
Saturday, O
and O
the O
Campbells O
leave O
town O
in O
their O
way O
to O
Holyhead O
the O
Monday O
following-- O
as O
you O
will O
find O
from O
Jane's O
letter. O
 O
So O
sudden!-- O
You O
may O
guess, O
dear O
Miss O
Woodhouse, O
what O
a O
flurry O
it O
has O
thrown O
me O
in! O
 O
If O
it O
was O
not O
for O
the O
drawback O
of O
her O
illness-- O
but O
I O
am O
afraid O
we O
must O
expect O
to O
see O
her O
grown O
thin, O
and O
looking O
very O
poorly. O
 O
I O
must O
tell O
you O
what O
an O
unlucky O
thing O
happened O
to O
me, O
as O
to O
that. O
 O
I O
always O
make O
a O
point O
of O
reading O
Jane's O
letters O
through O
to O
myself O
first, O
before O
I O
read O
them O
aloud O
to O
my O
mother, O
you O
know, O
for O
fear O
of O
there O
being O
any O
thing O
in O
them O
to O
distress O
her. O
 O
Jane O
desired O
me O
to O
do O
it, O
so O
I O
always O
do: O
 O
and O
so O
I O
began O
to-day O
with O
my O
usual O
caution; O
but O
no O
sooner O
did O
I O
come O
to O
the O
mention O
of O
her O
being O
unwell, O
than O
I O
burst O
out, O
quite O
frightened, O
with O
'Bless O
me! O
poor O
Jane O
is O
ill!'-- O
which O
my O
mother, O
being O
on O
the O
watch, O
heard O
distinctly, O
and O
was O
sadly O
alarmed O
at. O
 O
However, O
when O
I O
read O
on, O
I O
found O
it O
was O
not O
near O
so O
bad O
as O
I O
had O
fancied O
at O
first; O
and O
I O
make O
so O
light O
of O
it O
now O
to O
her, O
that O
she O
does O
not O
think O
much O
about O
it. O
 O
But O
I O
cannot O
imagine O
how O
I O
could O
be O
so O
off O
my O
guard. O
 O
If O
Jane O
does O
not O
get O
well O
soon, O
we O
will O
call O
in O
Mr. O
Perry. O
 O
The O
expense O
shall O
not O
be O
thought O
of; O
and O
though O
he O
is O
so O
liberal, O
and O
so O
fond O
of O
Jane O
that O
I O
dare O
say O
he O
would O
not O
mean O
to O
charge O
any O
thing O
for O
attendance, O
we O
could O
not O
suffer O
it O
to O
be O
so, O
you O
know. O
 O
He O
has O
a O
wife O
and O
family O
to O
maintain, O
and O
is O
not O
to O
be O
giving O
away O
his O
time. O
 O
Well, O
now O
I O
have O
just O
given O
you O
a O
hint O
of O
what O
Jane O
writes O
about, O
we O
will O
turn O
to O
her O
letter, O
and O
I O
am O
sure O
she O
tells O
her O
own O
story O
a O
great O
deal O
better O
than O
I O
can O
tell O
it O
for O
her." O
"I O
am O
afraid O
we O
must O
be O
running O
away," O
said O
Emma, O
glancing O
at O
Harriet, O
and O
beginning O
to O
rise-- O
"My O
father O
will O
be O
expecting O
us. O
 O
I O
had O
no O
intention, O
I O
thought O
I O
had O
no O
power O
of O
staying O
more O
than O
five O
minutes, O
when O
I O
first O
entered O
the O
house. O
 O
I O
merely O
called, O
because O
I O
would O
not O
pass O
the O
door O
without O
inquiring O
after O
Mrs. O
Bates; O
but O
I O
have O
been O
so O
pleasantly O
detained! O
 O
Now, O
however, O
we O
must O
wish O
you O
and O
Mrs. O
Bates O
good O
morning." O
And O
not O
all O
that O
could O
be O
urged O
to O
detain O
her O
succeeded. O
 O
She O
regained O
the O
street-- O
happy O
in O
this, O
that O
though O
much O
had O
been O
forced O
on O
her O
against O
her O
will, O
though O
she O
had O
in O
fact O
heard O
the O
whole O
substance O
of O
Jane O
Fairfax's O
letter, O
she O
had O
been O
able O
to O
escape O
the O
letter O
itself. O
CHAPTER O
II O
Jane O
Fairfax O
was O
an O
orphan, O
the O
only O
child O
of O
Mrs. O
Bates's O
youngest O
daughter. O
The O
marriage O
of O
Lieut. O
Fairfax O
of O
the O
 O
regiment O
of O
infantry, O
and O
Miss O
Jane O
Bates, O
had O
had O
its O
day O
of O
fame O
and O
pleasure, O
hope O
and O
interest; O
but O
nothing O
now O
remained O
of O
it, O
save O
the O
melancholy O
remembrance O
of O
him O
dying O
in O
action O
abroad-- O
of O
his O
widow O
sinking O
under O
consumption O
and O
grief O
soon O
afterwards-- O
and O
this O
girl. O
By O
birth O
she O
belonged O
to O
Highbury: O
 O
and O
when O
at O
three O
years O
old, O
on O
losing O
her O
mother, O
she O
became O
the O
property, O
the O
charge, O
the O
consolation, O
the O
fondling O
of O
her O
grandmother O
and O
aunt, O
there O
had O
seemed O
every O
probability O
of O
her O
being O
permanently O
fixed O
there; O
of O
her O
being O
taught O
only O
what O
very O
limited O
means O
could O
command, O
and O
growing O
up O
with O
no O
advantages O
of O
connexion O
or O
improvement, O
to O
be O
engrafted O
on O
what O
nature O
had O
given O
her O
in O
a O
pleasing O
person, O
good O
understanding, O
and O
warm-hearted, O
well-meaning O
relations. O
But O
the O
compassionate O
feelings O
of O
a O
friend O
of O
her O
father O
gave O
a O
change O
to O
her O
destiny. O
 O
This O
was O
Colonel O
Campbell, O
who O
had O
very O
highly O
regarded O
Fairfax, O
as O
an O
excellent O
officer O
and O
most O
deserving O
young O
man; O
and O
farther, O
had O
been O
indebted O
to O
him O
for O
such O
attentions, O
during O
a O
severe O
camp-fever, O
as O
he O
believed O
had O
saved O
his O
life. O
 O
These O
were O
claims O
which O
he O
did O
not O
learn O
to O
overlook, O
though O
some O
years O
passed O
away O
from O
the O
death O
of O
poor O
Fairfax, O
before O
his O
own O
return O
to O
England O
put O
any O
thing O
in O
his O
power. O
 O
When O
he O
did O
return, O
he O
sought O
out O
the O
child O
and O
took O
notice O
of O
her. O
 O
He O
was O
a O
married O
man, O
with O
only O
one O
living O
child, O
a O
girl, O
about O
Jane's O
age: O
 O
and O
Jane O
became O
their O
guest, O
paying O
them O
long O
visits O
and O
growing O
a O
favourite O
with O
all; O
and O
before O
she O
was O
nine O
years O
old, O
his O
daughter's O
great O
fondness O
for O
her, O
and O
his O
own O
wish O
of O
being O
a O
real O
friend, O
united O
to O
produce O
an O
offer O
from O
Colonel O
Campbell O
of O
undertaking O
the O
whole O
charge O
of O
her O
education. O
 O
It O
was O
accepted; O
and O
from O
that O
period O
Jane O
had O
belonged O
to O
Colonel O
Campbell's O
family, O
and O
had O
lived O
with O
them O
entirely, O
only O
visiting O
her O
grandmother O
from O
time O
to O
time. O
The O
plan O
was O
that O
she O
should O
be O
brought O
up O
for O
educating O
others; O
the O
very O
few O
hundred O
pounds O
which O
she O
inherited O
from O
her O
father O
making O
independence O
impossible. O
 O
To O
provide O
for O
her O
otherwise O
was O
out O
of O
Colonel O
Campbell's O
power; O
for O
though O
his O
income, O
by O
pay O
and O
appointments, O
was O
handsome, O
his O
fortune O
was O
moderate O
and O
must O
be O
all O
his O
daughter's; O
but, O
by O
giving O
her O
an O
education, O
he O
hoped O
to O
be O
supplying O
the O
means O
of O
respectable O
subsistence O
hereafter. O
Such O
was O
Jane O
Fairfax's O
history. O
 O
She O
had O
fallen O
into O
good O
hands, O
known O
nothing O
but O
kindness O
from O
the O
Campbells, O
and O
been O
given O
an O
excellent O
education. O
 O
Living O
constantly O
with O
right-minded O
and O
well-informed O
people, O
her O
heart O
and O
understanding O
had O
received O
every O
advantage O
of O
discipline O
and O
culture; O
and O
Colonel O
Campbell's O
residence O
being O
in O
London, O
every O
lighter O
talent O
had O
been O
done O
full O
justice O
to, O
by O
the O
attendance O
of O
first-rate O
masters. O
 O
Her O
disposition O
and O
abilities O
were O
equally O
worthy O
of O
all O
that O
friendship O
could O
do; O
and O
at O
eighteen O
or O
nineteen O
she O
was, O
as O
far O
as O
such O
an O
early O
age O
can O
be O
qualified O
for O
the O
care O
of O
children, O
fully O
competent O
to O
the O
office O
of O
instruction O
herself; O
but O
she O
was O
too O
much O
beloved O
to O
be O
parted O
with. O
 O
Neither O
father O
nor O
mother O
could O
promote, O
and O
the O
daughter O
could O
not O
endure O
it. O
 O
The O
evil O
day O
was O
put O
off. O
 O
It O
was O
easy O
to O
decide O
that O
she O
was O
still O
too O
young; O
and O
Jane O
remained O
with O
them, O
sharing, O
as O
another O
daughter, O
in O
all O
the O
rational O
pleasures O
of O
an O
elegant O
society, O
and O
a O
judicious O
mixture O
of O
home O
and O
amusement, O
with O
only O
the O
drawback O
of O
the O
future, O
the O
sobering O
suggestions O
of O
her O
own O
good O
understanding O
to O
remind O
her O
that O
all O
this O
might O
soon O
be O
over. O
The O
affection O
of O
the O
whole O
family, O
the O
warm O
attachment O
of O
Miss O
Campbell O
in O
particular, O
was O
the O
more O
honourable O
to O
each O
party O
from O
the O
circumstance O
of O
Jane's O
decided O
superiority O
both O
in O
beauty O
and O
acquirements. O
 O
That O
nature O
had O
given O
it O
in O
feature O
could O
not O
be O
unseen O
by O
the O
young O
woman, O
nor O
could O
her O
higher O
powers O
of O
mind O
be O
unfelt O
by O
the O
parents. O
 O
They O
continued O
together O
with O
unabated O
regard O
however, O
till O
the O
marriage O
of O
Miss O
Campbell, O
who O
by O
that O
chance, O
that O
luck O
which O
so O
often O
defies O
anticipation O
in O
matrimonial O
affairs, O
giving O
attraction O
to O
what O
is O
moderate O
rather O
than O
to O
what O
is O
superior, O
engaged O
the O
affections O
of O
Mr. O
Dixon, O
a O
young O
man, O
rich O
and O
agreeable, O
almost O
as O
soon O
as O
they O
were O
acquainted; O
and O
was O
eligibly O
and O
happily O
settled, O
while O
Jane O
Fairfax O
had O
yet O
her O
bread O
to O
earn. O
This O
event O
had O
very O
lately O
taken O
place; O
too O
lately O
for O
any O
thing O
to O
be O
yet O
attempted O
by O
her O
less O
fortunate O
friend O
towards O
entering O
on O
her O
path O
of O
duty; O
though O
she O
had O
now O
reached O
the O
age O
which O
her O
own O
judgment O
had O
fixed O
on O
for O
beginning. O
 O
She O
had O
long O
resolved O
that O
one-and-twenty O
should O
be O
the O
period. O
 O
With O
the O
fortitude O
of O
a O
devoted O
novitiate, O
she O
had O
resolved O
at O
one-and-twenty O
to O
complete O
the O
sacrifice, O
and O
retire O
from O
all O
the O
pleasures O
of O
life, O
of O
rational O
intercourse, O
equal O
society, O
peace O
and O
hope, O
to O
penance O
and O
mortification O
for O
ever. O
The O
good O
sense O
of O
Colonel O
and O
Mrs. O
Campbell O
could O
not O
oppose O
such O
a O
resolution, O
though O
their O
feelings O
did. O
 O
As O
long O
as O
they O
lived, O
no O
exertions O
would O
be O
necessary, O
their O
home O
might O
be O
hers O
for O
ever; O
and O
for O
their O
own O
comfort O
they O
would O
have O
retained O
her O
wholly; O
but O
this O
would O
be O
selfishness:-- O
what O
must O
be O
at O
last, O
had O
better O
be O
soon. O
Perhaps O
they O
began O
to O
feel O
it O
might O
have O
been O
kinder O
and O
wiser O
to O
have O
resisted O
the O
temptation O
of O
any O
delay, O
and O
spared O
her O
from O
a O
taste O
of O
such O
enjoyments O
of O
ease O
and O
leisure O
as O
must O
now O
be O
relinquished. O
Still, O
however, O
affection O
was O
glad O
to O
catch O
at O
any O
reasonable O
excuse O
for O
not O
hurrying O
on O
the O
wretched O
moment. O
 O
She O
had O
never O
been O
quite O
well O
since O
the O
time O
of O
their O
daughter's O
marriage; O
and O
till O
she O
should O
have O
completely O
recovered O
her O
usual O
strength, O
they O
must O
forbid O
her O
engaging O
in O
duties, O
which, O
so O
far O
from O
being O
compatible O
with O
a O
weakened O
frame O
and O
varying O
spirits, O
seemed, O
under O
the O
most O
favourable O
circumstances, O
to O
require O
something O
more O
than O
human O
perfection O
of O
body O
and O
mind O
to O
be O
discharged O
with O
tolerable O
comfort. O
With O
regard O
to O
her O
not O
accompanying O
them O
to O
Ireland, O
her O
account O
to O
her O
aunt O
contained O
nothing O
but O
truth, O
though O
there O
might O
be O
some O
truths O
not O
told. O
 O
It O
was O
her O
own O
choice O
to O
give O
the O
time O
of O
their O
absence O
to O
Highbury; O
to O
spend, O
perhaps, O
her O
last O
months O
of O
perfect O
liberty O
with O
those O
kind O
relations O
to O
whom O
she O
was O
so O
very O
dear: O
and O
the O
Campbells, O
whatever O
might O
be O
their O
motive O
or O
motives, O
whether O
single, O
or O
double, O
or O
treble, O
gave O
the O
arrangement O
their O
ready O
sanction, O
and O
said, O
that O
they O
depended O
more O
on O
a O
few O
months O
spent O
in O
her O
native O
air, O
for O
the O
recovery O
of O
her O
health, O
than O
on O
any O
thing O
else. O
 O
Certain O
it O
was O
that O
she O
was O
to O
come; O
and O
that O
Highbury, O
instead O
of O
welcoming O
that O
perfect O
novelty O
which O
had O
been O
so O
long O
promised O
it-- O
Mr. O
Frank O
Churchill-- O
must O
put O
up O
for O
the O
present O
with O
Jane O
Fairfax, O
who O
could O
bring O
only O
the O
freshness O
of O
a O
two O
years' O
absence. O
Emma O
was O
sorry;-- O
to O
have O
to O
pay O
civilities O
to O
a O
person O
she O
did O
not O
like O
through O
three O
long O
months!-- O
to O
be O
always O
doing O
more O
than O
she O
wished, O
and O
less O
than O
she O
ought! O
 O
Why O
she O
did O
not O
like O
Jane O
Fairfax O
might O
be O
a O
difficult O
question O
to O
answer; O
Mr. O
Knightley O
had O
once O
told O
her O
it O
was O
because O
she O
saw O
in O
her O
the O
really O
accomplished O
young O
woman, O
which O
she O
wanted O
to O
be O
thought O
herself; O
and O
though O
the O
accusation O
had O
been O
eagerly O
refuted O
at O
the O
time, O
there O
were O
moments O
of O
self-examination O
in O
which O
her O
conscience O
could O
not O
quite O
acquit O
her. O
 O
But O
"she O
could O
never O
get O
acquainted O
with O
her: O
she O
did O
not O
know O
how O
it O
was, O
but O
there O
was O
such O
coldness O
and O
reserve-- O
such O
apparent O
indifference O
whether O
she O
pleased O
or O
not-- O
and O
then, O
her O
aunt O
was O
such O
an O
eternal O
talker!-- O
and O
she O
was O
made O
such O
a O
fuss O
with O
by O
every O
body!-- O
and O
it O
had O
been O
always O
imagined O
that O
they O
were O
to O
be O
so O
intimate-- O
because O
their O
ages O
were O
the O
same, O
every O
body O
had O
supposed O
they O
must O
be O
so O
fond O
of O
each O
other." O
These O
were O
her O
reasons-- O
she O
had O
no O
better. O
It O
was O
a O
dislike O
so O
little O
just-- O
every O
imputed O
fault O
was O
so O
magnified O
by O
fancy, O
that O
she O
never O
saw O
Jane O
Fairfax O
the O
first O
time O
after O
any O
considerable O
absence, O
without O
feeling O
that O
she O
had O
injured O
her; O
and O
now, O
when O
the O
due O
visit O
was O
paid, O
on O
her O
arrival, O
after O
a O
two O
years' O
interval, O
she O
was O
particularly O
struck O
with O
the O
very O
appearance O
and O
manners, O
which O
for O
those O
two O
whole O
years O
she O
had O
been O
depreciating. O
Jane O
Fairfax O
was O
very O
elegant, O
remarkably O
elegant; O
and O
she O
had O
herself O
the O
highest O
value O
for O
elegance. O
 O
Her O
height O
was O
pretty, O
just O
such O
as O
almost O
every O
body O
would O
think O
tall, O
and O
nobody O
could O
think O
very O
tall; O
her O
figure O
particularly O
graceful; O
her O
size O
a O
most O
becoming O
medium, O
between O
fat O
and O
thin, O
though O
a O
slight O
appearance O
of O
ill-health O
seemed O
to O
point O
out O
the O
likeliest O
evil O
of O
the O
two. O
 O
Emma O
could O
not O
but O
feel O
all O
this; O
and O
then, O
her O
face-- O
her O
features-- O
there O
was O
more O
beauty O
in O
them O
altogether O
than O
she O
had O
remembered; O
it O
was O
not O
regular, O
but O
it O
was O
very O
pleasing O
beauty. O
 O
Her O
eyes, O
a O
deep O
grey, O
with O
dark O
eye-lashes O
and O
eyebrows, O
had O
never O
been O
denied O
their O
praise; O
but O
the O
skin, O
which O
she O
had O
been O
used O
to O
cavil O
at, O
as O
wanting O
colour, O
had O
a O
clearness O
and O
delicacy O
which O
really O
needed O
no O
fuller O
bloom. O
 O
It O
was O
a O
style O
of O
beauty, O
of O
which O
elegance O
was O
the O
reigning O
character, O
and O
as O
such, O
she O
must, O
in O
honour, O
by O
all O
her O
principles, O
admire O
it:-- O
elegance, O
which, O
whether O
of O
person O
or O
of O
mind, O
she O
saw O
so O
little O
in O
Highbury. O
 O
There, O
not O
to O
be O
vulgar, O
was O
distinction, O
and O
merit. O
In O
short, O
she O
sat, O
during O
the O
first O
visit, O
looking O
at O
Jane O
Fairfax O
with O
twofold O
complacency; O
the O
sense O
of O
pleasure O
and O
the O
sense O
of O
rendering O
justice, O
and O
was O
determining O
that O
she O
would O
dislike O
her O
no O
longer. O
When O
she O
took O
in O
her O
history, O
indeed, O
her O
situation, O
as O
well O
as O
her O
beauty; O
when O
she O
considered O
what O
all O
this O
elegance O
was O
destined O
to, O
what O
she O
was O
going O
to O
sink O
from, O
how O
she O
was O
going O
to O
live, O
it O
seemed O
impossible O
to O
feel O
any O
thing O
but O
compassion O
and O
respect; O
especially, O
if O
to O
every O
well-known O
particular O
entitling O
her O
to O
interest, O
were O
added O
the O
highly O
probable O
circumstance O
of O
an O
attachment O
to O
Mr. O
Dixon, O
which O
she O
had O
so O
naturally O
started O
to O
herself. O
 O
In O
that O
case, O
nothing O
could O
be O
more O
pitiable O
or O
more O
honourable O
than O
the O
sacrifices O
she O
had O
resolved O
on. O
 O
Emma O
was O
very O
willing O
now O
to O
acquit O
her O
of O
having O
seduced O
Mr. O
Dixon's O
actions O
from O
his O
wife, O
or O
of O
any O
thing O
mischievous O
which O
her O
imagination O
had O
suggested O
at O
first. O
 O
If O
it O
were O
love, O
it O
might O
be O
simple, O
single, O
successless O
love O
on O
her O
side O
alone. O
 O
She O
might O
have O
been O
unconsciously O
sucking O
in O
the O
sad O
poison, O
while O
a O
sharer O
of O
his O
conversation O
with O
her O
friend; O
and O
from O
the O
best, O
the O
purest O
of O
motives, O
might O
now O
be O
denying O
herself O
this O
visit O
to O
Ireland, O
and O
resolving O
to O
divide O
herself O
effectually O
from O
him O
and O
his O
connexions O
by O
soon O
beginning O
her O
career O
of O
laborious O
duty. O
Upon O
the O
whole, O
Emma O
left O
her O
with O
such O
softened, O
charitable O
feelings, O
as O
made O
her O
look O
around O
in O
walking O
home, O
and O
lament O
that O
Highbury O
afforded O
no O
young O
man O
worthy O
of O
giving O
her O
independence; O
nobody O
that O
she O
could O
wish O
to O
scheme O
about O
for O
her. O
These O
were O
charming O
feelings-- O
but O
not O
lasting. O
 O
Before O
she O
had O
committed O
herself O
by O
any O
public O
profession O
of O
eternal O
friendship O
for O
Jane O
Fairfax, O
or O
done O
more O
towards O
a O
recantation O
of O
past O
prejudices O
and O
errors, O
than O
saying O
to O
Mr. O
Knightley, O
"She O
certainly O
is O
handsome; O
she O
is O
better O
than O
handsome!" O
Jane O
had O
spent O
an O
evening O
at O
Hartfield O
with O
her O
grandmother O
and O
aunt, O
and O
every O
thing O
was O
relapsing O
much O
into O
its O
usual O
state. O
 O
Former O
provocations O
reappeared. O
 O
The O
aunt O
was O
as O
tiresome O
as O
ever; O
more O
tiresome, O
because O
anxiety O
for O
her O
health O
was O
now O
added O
to O
admiration O
of O
her O
powers; O
and O
they O
had O
to O
listen O
to O
the O
description O
of O
exactly O
how O
little O
bread O
and O
butter O
she O
ate O
for O
breakfast, O
and O
how O
small O
a O
slice O
of O
mutton O
for O
dinner, O
as O
well O
as O
to O
see O
exhibitions O
of O
new O
caps O
and O
new O
workbags O
for O
her O
mother O
and O
herself; O
and O
Jane's O
offences O
rose O
again. O
 O
They O
had O
music; O
Emma O
was O
obliged O
to O
play; O
and O
the O
thanks O
and O
praise O
which O
necessarily O
followed O
appeared O
to O
her O
an O
affectation O
of O
candour, O
an O
air O
of O
greatness, O
meaning O
only O
to O
shew O
off O
in O
higher O
style O
her O
own O
very O
superior O
performance. O
 O
She O
was, O
besides, O
which O
was O
the O
worst O
of O
all, O
so O
cold, O
so O
cautious! O
 O
There O
was O
no O
getting O
at O
her O
real O
opinion. O
 O
Wrapt O
up O
in O
a O
cloak O
of O
politeness, O
she O
seemed O
determined O
to O
hazard O
nothing. O
 O
She O
was O
disgustingly, O
was O
suspiciously O
reserved. O
If O
any O
thing O
could O
be O
more, O
where O
all O
was O
most, O
she O
was O
more O
reserved O
on O
the O
subject O
of O
Weymouth O
and O
the O
Dixons O
than O
any O
thing. O
 O
She O
seemed O
bent O
on O
giving O
no O
real O
insight O
into O
Mr. O
Dixon's O
character, O
or O
her O
own O
value O
for O
his O
company, O
or O
opinion O
of O
the O
suitableness O
of O
the O
match. O
 O
It O
was O
all O
general O
approbation O
and O
smoothness; O
nothing O
delineated O
or O
distinguished. O
 O
It O
did O
her O
no O
service O
however. O
 O
Her O
caution O
was O
thrown O
away. O
 O
Emma O
saw O
its O
artifice, O
and O
returned O
to O
her O
first O
surmises. O
There O
probably O
was O
something O
more O
to O
conceal O
than O
her O
own O
preference; O
Mr. O
Dixon, O
perhaps, O
had O
been O
very O
near O
changing O
one O
friend O
for O
the O
other, O
or O
been O
fixed O
only O
to O
Miss O
Campbell, O
for O
the O
sake O
of O
the O
future O
twelve O
thousand O
pounds. O
The O
like O
reserve O
prevailed O
on O
other O
topics. O
 O
She O
and O
Mr. O
Frank O
Churchill O
had O
been O
at O
Weymouth O
at O
the O
same O
time. O
 O
It O
was O
known O
that O
they O
were O
a O
little O
acquainted; O
but O
not O
a O
syllable O
of O
real O
information O
could O
Emma O
procure O
as O
to O
what O
he O
truly O
was. O
 O
"Was O
he O
handsome?"-- O
"She O
believed O
he O
was O
reckoned O
a O
very O
fine O
young O
man." O
"Was O
he O
agreeable?"-- O
"He O
was O
generally O
thought O
so." O
"Did O
he O
appear O
a O
sensible O
young O
man; O
a O
young O
man O
of O
information?"-- O
"At O
a O
watering-place, O
or O
in O
a O
common O
London O
acquaintance, O
it O
was O
difficult O
to O
decide O
on O
such O
points. O
 O
Manners O
were O
all O
that O
could O
be O
safely O
judged O
of, O
under O
a O
much O
longer O
knowledge O
than O
they O
had O
yet O
had O
of O
Mr. O
Churchill. O
 O
She O
believed O
every O
body O
found O
his O
manners O
pleasing." O
Emma O
could O
not O
forgive O
her. O
CHAPTER O
III O
Emma O
could O
not O
forgive O
her;-- O
but O
as O
neither O
provocation O
nor O
resentment O
were O
discerned O
by O
Mr. O
Knightley, O
who O
had O
been O
of O
the O
party, O
and O
had O
seen O
only O
proper O
attention O
and O
pleasing O
behaviour O
on O
each O
side, O
he O
was O
expressing O
the O
next O
morning, O
being O
at O
Hartfield O
again O
on O
business O
with O
Mr. O
Woodhouse, O
his O
approbation O
of O
the O
whole; O
not O
so O
openly O
as O
he O
might O
have O
done O
had O
her O
father O
been O
out O
of O
the O
room, O
but O
speaking O
plain O
enough O
to O
be O
very O
intelligible O
to O
Emma. O
 O
He O
had O
been O
used O
to O
think O
her O
unjust O
to O
Jane, O
and O
had O
now O
great O
pleasure O
in O
marking O
an O
improvement. O
"A O
very O
pleasant O
evening," O
he O
began, O
as O
soon O
as O
Mr. O
Woodhouse O
had O
been O
talked O
into O
what O
was O
necessary, O
told O
that O
he O
understood, O
and O
the O
papers O
swept O
away;-- O
"particularly O
pleasant. O
 O
You O
and O
Miss O
Fairfax O
gave O
us O
some O
very O
good O
music. O
 O
I O
do O
not O
know O
a O
more O
luxurious O
state, O
sir, O
than O
sitting O
at O
one's O
ease O
to O
be O
entertained O
a O
whole O
evening O
by O
two O
such O
young O
women; O
sometimes O
with O
music O
and O
sometimes O
with O
conversation. O
 O
I O
am O
sure O
Miss O
Fairfax O
must O
have O
found O
the O
evening O
pleasant, O
Emma. O
 O
You O
left O
nothing O
undone. O
 O
I O
was O
glad O
you O
made O
her O
play O
so O
much, O
for O
having O
no O
instrument O
at O
her O
grandmother's, O
it O
must O
have O
been O
a O
real O
indulgence." O
"I O
am O
happy O
you O
approved," O
said O
Emma, O
smiling; O
"but O
I O
hope O
I O
am O
not O
often O
deficient O
in O
what O
is O
due O
to O
guests O
at O
Hartfield." O
"No, O
my O
dear," O
said O
her O
father O
instantly; O
"that O
I O
am O
sure O
you O
are O
not. O
 O
There O
is O
nobody O
half O
so O
attentive O
and O
civil O
as O
you O
are. O
 O
If O
any O
thing, O
you O
are O
too O
attentive. O
 O
The O
muffin O
last O
night-- O
if O
it O
had O
been O
handed O
round O
once, O
I O
think O
it O
would O
have O
been O
enough." O
"No," O
said O
Mr. O
Knightley, O
nearly O
at O
the O
same O
time; O
"you O
are O
not O
often O
deficient; O
not O
often O
deficient O
either O
in O
manner O
or O
comprehension. O
 O
I O
think O
you O
understand O
me, O
therefore." O
An O
arch O
look O
expressed-- O
"I O
understand O
you O
well O
enough;" O
but O
she O
said O
only, O
"Miss O
Fairfax O
is O
reserved." O
"I O
always O
told O
you O
she O
was O
-- O
a O
little; O
but O
you O
will O
soon O
overcome O
all O
that O
part O
of O
her O
reserve O
which O
ought O
to O
be O
overcome, O
all O
that O
has O
its O
foundation O
in O
diffidence. O
 O
What O
arises O
from O
discretion O
must O
be O
honoured." O
"You O
think O
her O
diffident. O
 O
I O
do O
not O
see O
it." O
"My O
dear O
Emma," O
said O
he, O
moving O
from O
his O
chair O
into O
one O
close O
by O
her, O
"you O
are O
not O
going O
to O
tell O
me, O
I O
hope, O
that O
you O
had O
not O
a O
pleasant O
evening." O
"Oh! O
no; O
I O
was O
pleased O
with O
my O
own O
perseverance O
in O
asking O
questions; O
and O
amused O
to O
think O
how O
little O
information O
I O
obtained." O
"I O
am O
disappointed," O
was O
his O
only O
answer. O
"I O
hope O
every O
body O
had O
a O
pleasant O
evening," O
said O
Mr. O
Woodhouse, O
in O
his O
quiet O
way. O
 O
"I O
had. O
 O
Once, O
I O
felt O
the O
fire O
rather O
too O
much; O
but O
then O
I O
moved O
back O
my O
chair O
a O
little, O
a O
very O
little, O
and O
it O
did O
not O
disturb O
me. O
Miss O
Bates O
was O
very O
chatty O
and O
good-humoured, O
as O
she O
always O
is, O
though O
she O
speaks O
rather O
too O
quick. O
 O
However, O
she O
is O
very O
agreeable, O
and O
Mrs. O
Bates O
too, O
in O
a O
different O
way. O
 O
I O
like O
old O
friends; O
and O
Miss O
Jane O
Fairfax O
is O
a O
very O
pretty O
sort O
of O
young O
lady, O
a O
very O
pretty O
and O
a O
very O
well-behaved O
young O
lady O
indeed. O
 O
She O
must O
have O
found O
the O
evening O
agreeable, O
Mr. O
Knightley, O
because O
she O
had O
Emma." O
"True, O
sir; O
and O
Emma, O
because O
she O
had O
Miss O
Fairfax." O
Emma O
saw O
his O
anxiety, O
and O
wishing O
to O
appease O
it, O
at O
least O
for O
the O
present, O
said, O
and O
with O
a O
sincerity O
which O
no O
one O
could O
question-- O
"She O
is O
a O
sort O
of O
elegant O
creature O
that O
one O
cannot O
keep O
one's O
eyes O
from. O
 O
I O
am O
always O
watching O
her O
to O
admire; O
and O
I O
do O
pity O
her O
from O
my O
heart." O
Mr. O
Knightley O
looked O
as O
if O
he O
were O
more O
gratified O
than O
he O
cared O
to O
express; O
and O
before O
he O
could O
make O
any O
reply, O
Mr. O
Woodhouse, O
whose O
thoughts O
were O
on O
the O
Bates's, O
said-- O
"It O
is O
a O
great O
pity O
that O
their O
circumstances O
should O
be O
so O
confined! O
 O
a O
great O
pity O
indeed! O
and O
I O
have O
often O
wished-- O
but O
it O
is O
so O
little O
one O
can O
venture O
to O
do-- O
small, O
trifling O
presents, O
of O
any O
thing O
uncommon-- O
Now O
we O
have O
killed O
a O
porker, O
and O
Emma O
thinks O
of O
sending O
them O
a O
loin O
or O
a O
leg; O
it O
is O
very O
small O
and O
delicate-- O
Hartfield O
pork O
is O
not O
like O
any O
other O
pork-- O
but O
still O
it O
is O
pork-- O
and, O
my O
dear O
Emma, O
unless O
one O
could O
be O
sure O
of O
their O
making O
it O
into O
steaks, O
nicely O
fried, O
as O
ours O
are O
fried, O
without O
the O
smallest O
grease, O
and O
not O
roast O
it, O
for O
no O
stomach O
can O
bear O
roast O
pork O
-- O
I O
think O
we O
had O
better O
send O
the O
leg-- O
do O
not O
you O
think O
so, O
my O
dear?" O
"My O
dear O
papa, O
I O
sent O
the O
whole O
hind-quarter. O
I O
knew O
you O
would O
wish O
it. O
There O
will O
be O
the O
leg O
to O
be O
salted, O
you O
know, O
which O
is O
so O
very O
nice, O
and O
the O
loin O
to O
be O
dressed O
directly O
in O
any O
manner O
they O
like." O
"That's O
right, O
my O
dear, O
very O
right. O
 O
I O
had O
not O
thought O
of O
it O
before, O
but O
that O
is O
the O
best O
way. O
 O
They O
must O
not O
over-salt O
the O
leg; O
and O
then, O
if O
it O
is O
not O
over-salted, O
and O
if O
it O
is O
very O
thoroughly O
boiled, O
just O
as O
Serle O
boils O
ours, O
and O
eaten O
very O
moderately O
of, O
with O
a O
boiled O
turnip, O
and O
a O
little O
carrot O
or O
parsnip, O
I O
do O
not O
consider O
it O
unwholesome." O
"Emma," O
said O
Mr. O
Knightley O
presently, O
"I O
have O
a O
piece O
of O
news O
for O
you. O
You O
like O
news-- O
and O
I O
heard O
an O
article O
in O
my O
way O
hither O
that O
I O
think O
will O
interest O
you." O
"News! O
 O
Oh! O
yes, O
I O
always O
like O
news. O
 O
What O
is O
it?-- O
why O
do O
you O
smile O
so?-- O
where O
did O
you O
hear O
it?-- O
at O
Randalls?" O
He O
had O
time O
only O
to O
say, O
"No, O
not O
at O
Randalls; O
I O
have O
not O
been O
near O
Randalls," O
when O
the O
door O
was O
thrown O
open, O
and O
Miss O
Bates O
and O
Miss O
Fairfax O
walked O
into O
the O
room. O
Full O
of O
thanks, O
and O
full O
of O
news, O
Miss O
Bates O
knew O
not O
which O
to O
give O
quickest. O
 O
Mr. O
Knightley O
soon O
saw O
that O
he O
had O
lost O
his O
moment, O
and O
that O
not O
another O
syllable O
of O
communication O
could O
rest O
with O
him. O
"Oh! O
my O
dear O
sir, O
how O
are O
you O
this O
morning? O
 O
My O
dear O
Miss O
Woodhouse-- O
I O
come O
quite O
over-powered. O
Such O
a O
beautiful O
hind-quarter O
of O
pork! O
 O
You O
are O
too O
bountiful! O
 O
Have O
you O
heard O
the O
news? O
 O
Mr. O
Elton O
is O
going O
to O
be O
married." O
Emma O
had O
not O
had O
time O
even O
to O
think O
of O
Mr. O
Elton, O
and O
she O
was O
so O
completely O
surprized O
that O
she O
could O
not O
avoid O
a O
little O
start, O
and O
a O
little O
blush, O
at O
the O
sound. O
"There O
is O
my O
news: O
-- O
I O
thought O
it O
would O
interest O
you," O
said O
Mr. O
Knightley, O
with O
a O
smile O
which O
implied O
a O
conviction O
of O
some O
part O
of O
what O
had O
passed O
between O
them. O
"But O
where O
could O
you O
hear O
it?" O
cried O
Miss O
Bates. O
 O
"Where O
could O
you O
possibly O
hear O
it, O
Mr. O
Knightley? O
 O
For O
it O
is O
not O
five O
minutes O
since O
I O
received O
Mrs. O
Cole's O
note-- O
no, O
it O
cannot O
be O
more O
than O
five-- O
or O
at O
least O
ten-- O
for O
I O
had O
got O
my O
bonnet O
and O
spencer O
on, O
just O
ready O
to O
come O
out O
-- O
I O
was O
only O
gone O
down O
to O
speak O
to O
Patty O
again O
about O
the O
pork-- O
Jane O
was O
standing O
in O
the O
passage-- O
were O
not O
you, O
Jane?-- O
for O
my O
mother O
was O
so O
afraid O
that O
we O
had O
not O
any O
salting-pan O
large O
enough. O
 O
So O
I O
said O
I O
would O
go O
down O
and O
see, O
and O
Jane O
said, O
'Shall O
I O
go O
down O
instead? O
for O
I O
think O
you O
have O
a O
little O
cold, O
and O
Patty O
has O
been O
washing O
the O
kitchen.'-- O
'Oh! O
my O
dear,' O
said O
I-- O
well, O
and O
just O
then O
came O
the O
note. O
 O
A O
Miss O
Hawkins-- O
that's O
all O
I O
know. O
 O
A O
Miss O
Hawkins O
of O
Bath. O
 O
But, O
Mr. O
Knightley, O
how O
could O
you O
possibly O
have O
heard O
it? O
for O
the O
very O
moment O
Mr. O
Cole O
told O
Mrs. O
Cole O
of O
it, O
she O
sat O
down O
and O
wrote O
to O
me. O
 O
A O
Miss O
Hawkins O
-- O
" O
"I O
was O
with O
Mr. O
Cole O
on O
business O
an O
hour O
and O
a O
half O
ago. O
 O
He O
had O
just O
read O
Elton's O
letter O
as O
I O
was O
shewn O
in, O
and O
handed O
it O
to O
me O
directly." O
"Well! O
that O
is O
quite O
-- O
I O
suppose O
there O
never O
was O
a O
piece O
of O
news O
more O
generally O
interesting. O
 O
My O
dear O
sir, O
you O
really O
are O
too O
bountiful. O
 O
My O
mother O
desires O
her O
very O
best O
compliments O
and O
regards, O
and O
a O
thousand O
thanks, O
and O
says O
you O
really O
quite O
oppress O
her." O
"We O
consider O
our O
Hartfield O
pork," O
replied O
Mr. O
Woodhouse-- O
"indeed O
it O
certainly O
is, O
so O
very O
superior O
to O
all O
other O
pork, O
that O
Emma O
and O
I O
cannot O
have O
a O
greater O
pleasure O
than O
-- O
" O
"Oh! O
my O
dear O
sir, O
as O
my O
mother O
says, O
our O
friends O
are O
only O
too O
good O
to O
us. O
 O
If O
ever O
there O
were O
people O
who, O
without O
having O
great O
wealth O
themselves, O
had O
every O
thing O
they O
could O
wish O
for, O
I O
am O
sure O
it O
is O
us. O
We O
may O
well O
say O
that O
'our O
lot O
is O
cast O
in O
a O
goodly O
heritage.' O
Well, O
Mr. O
Knightley, O
and O
so O
you O
actually O
saw O
the O
letter; O
well O
-- O
" O
"It O
was O
short-- O
merely O
to O
announce-- O
but O
cheerful, O
exulting, O
of O
course."-- O
Here O
was O
a O
sly O
glance O
at O
Emma. O
 O
"He O
had O
been O
so O
fortunate O
as O
to O
-- O
I O
forget O
the O
precise O
words-- O
one O
has O
no O
business O
to O
remember O
them. O
The O
information O
was, O
as O
you O
state, O
that O
he O
was O
going O
to O
be O
married O
to O
a O
Miss O
Hawkins. O
 O
By O
his O
style, O
I O
should O
imagine O
it O
just O
settled." O
"Mr. O
Elton O
going O
to O
be O
married!" O
said O
Emma, O
as O
soon O
as O
she O
could O
speak. O
"He O
will O
have O
every O
body's O
wishes O
for O
his O
happiness." O
"He O
is O
very O
young O
to O
settle," O
was O
Mr. O
Woodhouse's O
observation. O
 O
"He O
had O
better O
not O
be O
in O
a O
hurry. O
 O
He O
seemed O
to O
me O
very O
well O
off O
as O
he O
was. O
 O
We O
were O
always O
glad O
to O
see O
him O
at O
Hartfield." O
"A O
new O
neighbour O
for O
us O
all, O
Miss O
Woodhouse!" O
said O
Miss O
Bates, O
joyfully; O
"my O
mother O
is O
so O
pleased!-- O
she O
says O
she O
cannot O
bear O
to O
have O
the O
poor O
old O
Vicarage O
without O
a O
mistress. O
 O
This O
is O
great O
news, O
indeed. O
Jane, O
you O
have O
never O
seen O
Mr. O
Elton!-- O
no O
wonder O
that O
you O
have O
such O
a O
curiosity O
to O
see O
him." O
Jane's O
curiosity O
did O
not O
appear O
of O
that O
absorbing O
nature O
as O
wholly O
to O
occupy O
her. O
"No O
-- O
I O
have O
never O
seen O
Mr. O
Elton," O
she O
replied, O
starting O
on O
this O
appeal; O
"is O
he-- O
is O
he O
a O
tall O
man?" O
"Who O
shall O
answer O
that O
question?" O
cried O
Emma. O
 O
"My O
father O
would O
say O
'yes,' O
Mr. O
Knightley O
'no;' O
and O
Miss O
Bates O
and O
I O
that O
he O
is O
just O
the O
happy O
medium. O
 O
When O
you O
have O
been O
here O
a O
little O
longer, O
Miss O
Fairfax, O
you O
will O
understand O
that O
Mr. O
Elton O
is O
the O
standard O
of O
perfection O
in O
Highbury, O
both O
in O
person O
and O
mind." O
"Very O
true, O
Miss O
Woodhouse, O
so O
she O
will. O
 O
He O
is O
the O
very O
best O
young O
man-- O
But, O
my O
dear O
Jane, O
if O
you O
remember, O
I O
told O
you O
yesterday O
he O
was O
precisely O
the O
height O
of O
Mr. O
Perry. O
 O
Miss O
Hawkins, O
-- O
I O
dare O
say, O
an O
excellent O
young O
woman. O
 O
His O
extreme O
attention O
to O
my O
mother-- O
wanting O
her O
to O
sit O
in O
the O
vicarage O
pew, O
that O
she O
might O
hear O
the O
better, O
for O
my O
mother O
is O
a O
little O
deaf, O
you O
know-- O
it O
is O
not O
much, O
but O
she O
does O
not O
hear O
quite O
quick. O
 O
Jane O
says O
that O
Colonel O
Campbell O
is O
a O
little O
deaf. O
He O
fancied O
bathing O
might O
be O
good O
for O
it-- O
the O
warm O
bath-- O
but O
she O
says O
it O
did O
him O
no O
lasting O
benefit. O
 O
Colonel O
Campbell, O
you O
know, O
is O
quite O
our O
angel. O
 O
And O
Mr. O
Dixon O
seems O
a O
very O
charming O
young O
man, O
quite O
worthy O
of O
him. O
 O
It O
is O
such O
a O
happiness O
when O
good O
people O
get O
together-- O
and O
they O
always O
do. O
 O
Now, O
here O
will O
be O
Mr. O
Elton O
and O
Miss O
Hawkins; O
and O
there O
are O
the O
Coles, O
such O
very O
good O
people; O
and O
the O
Perrys O
-- O
I O
suppose O
there O
never O
was O
a O
happier O
or O
a O
better O
couple O
than O
Mr. O
and O
Mrs. O
Perry. O
 O
I O
say, O
sir," O
turning O
to O
Mr. O
Woodhouse, O
"I O
think O
there O
are O
few O
places O
with O
such O
society O
as O
Highbury. O
 O
I O
always O
say, O
we O
are O
quite O
blessed O
in O
our O
neighbours.-- O
My O
dear O
sir, O
if O
there O
is O
one O
thing O
my O
mother O
loves O
better O
than O
another, O
it O
is O
pork O
-- O
a O
roast O
loin O
of O
pork O
-- O
" O
"As O
to O
who, O
or O
what O
Miss O
Hawkins O
is, O
or O
how O
long O
he O
has O
been O
acquainted O
with O
her," O
said O
Emma, O
"nothing O
I O
suppose O
can O
be O
known. O
 O
One O
feels O
that O
it O
cannot O
be O
a O
very O
long O
acquaintance. O
 O
He O
has O
been O
gone O
only O
four O
weeks." O
Nobody O
had O
any O
information O
to O
give; O
and, O
after O
a O
few O
more O
wonderings, O
Emma O
said, O
"You O
are O
silent, O
Miss O
Fairfax-- O
but O
I O
hope O
you O
mean O
to O
take O
an O
interest O
in O
this O
news. O
 O
You, O
who O
have O
been O
hearing O
and O
seeing O
so O
much O
of O
late O
on O
these O
subjects, O
who O
must O
have O
been O
so O
deep O
in O
the O
business O
on O
Miss O
Campbell's O
account-- O
we O
shall O
not O
excuse O
your O
being O
indifferent O
about O
Mr. O
Elton O
and O
Miss O
Hawkins." O
"When O
I O
have O
seen O
Mr. O
Elton," O
replied O
Jane, O
"I O
dare O
say O
I O
shall O
be O
interested-- O
but O
I O
believe O
it O
requires O
that O
with O
me. O
 O
And O
as O
it O
is O
some O
months O
since O
Miss O
Campbell O
married, O
the O
impression O
may O
be O
a O
little O
worn O
off." O
"Yes, O
he O
has O
been O
gone O
just O
four O
weeks, O
as O
you O
observe, O
Miss O
Woodhouse," O
said O
Miss O
Bates, O
"four O
weeks O
yesterday. O
-- O
A O
Miss O
Hawkins!-- O
Well, O
I O
had O
always O
rather O
fancied O
it O
would O
be O
some O
young O
lady O
hereabouts; O
not O
that O
I O
ever-- O
Mrs. O
Cole O
once O
whispered O
to O
me-- O
but O
I O
immediately O
said, O
'No, O
Mr. O
Elton O
is O
a O
most O
worthy O
young O
man-- O
but'-- O
In O
short, O
I O
do O
not O
think O
I O
am O
particularly O
quick O
at O
those O
sort O
of O
discoveries. O
 O
I O
do O
not O
pretend O
to O
it. O
 O
What O
is O
before O
me, O
I O
see. O
 O
At O
the O
same O
time, O
nobody O
could O
wonder O
if O
Mr. O
Elton O
should O
have O
aspired-- O
Miss O
Woodhouse O
lets O
me O
chatter O
on, O
so O
good-humouredly. O
She O
knows O
I O
would O
not O
offend O
for O
the O
world. O
 O
How O
does O
Miss O
Smith O
do? O
 O
She O
seems O
quite O
recovered O
now. O
 O
Have O
you O
heard O
from O
Mrs. O
John O
Knightley O
lately? O
 O
Oh! O
those O
dear O
little O
children. O
 O
Jane, O
do O
you O
know O
I O
always O
fancy O
Mr. O
Dixon O
like O
Mr. O
John O
Knightley. O
 O
I O
mean O
in O
person-- O
tall, O
and O
with O
that O
sort O
of O
look-- O
and O
not O
very O
talkative." O
"Quite O
wrong, O
my O
dear O
aunt; O
there O
is O
no O
likeness O
at O
all." O
"Very O
odd! O
but O
one O
never O
does O
form O
a O
just O
idea O
of O
any O
body O
beforehand. O
One O
takes O
up O
a O
notion, O
and O
runs O
away O
with O
it. O
 O
Mr. O
Dixon, O
you O
say, O
is O
not, O
strictly O
speaking, O
handsome?" O
"Handsome! O
 O
Oh! O
no-- O
far O
from O
it-- O
certainly O
plain. O
 O
I O
told O
you O
he O
was O
plain." O
"My O
dear, O
you O
said O
that O
Miss O
Campbell O
would O
not O
allow O
him O
to O
be O
plain, O
and O
that O
you O
yourself O
-- O
" O
"Oh! O
as O
for O
me, O
my O
judgment O
is O
worth O
nothing. O
 O
Where O
I O
have O
a O
regard, O
I O
always O
think O
a O
person O
well-looking. O
But O
I O
gave O
what O
I O
believed O
the O
general O
opinion, O
when O
I O
called O
him O
plain." O
"Well, O
my O
dear O
Jane, O
I O
believe O
we O
must O
be O
running O
away. O
 O
The O
weather O
does O
not O
look O
well, O
and O
grandmama O
will O
be O
uneasy. O
 O
You O
are O
too O
obliging, O
my O
dear O
Miss O
Woodhouse; O
but O
we O
really O
must O
take O
leave. O
 O
This O
has O
been O
a O
most O
agreeable O
piece O
of O
news O
indeed. O
 O
I O
shall O
just O
go O
round O
by O
Mrs. O
Cole's; O
but O
I O
shall O
not O
stop O
three O
minutes: O
and, O
Jane, O
you O
had O
better O
go O
home O
directly O
-- O
I O
would O
not O
have O
you O
out O
in O
a O
shower!-- O
We O
think O
she O
is O
the O
better O
for O
Highbury O
already. O
 O
Thank O
you, O
we O
do O
indeed. O
I O
shall O
not O
attempt O
calling O
on O
Mrs. O
Goddard, O
for O
I O
really O
do O
not O
think O
she O
cares O
for O
any O
thing O
but O
boiled O
pork: O
when O
we O
dress O
the O
leg O
it O
will O
be O
another O
thing. O
 O
Good O
morning O
to O
you, O
my O
dear O
sir. O
 O
Oh! O
 O
Mr. O
Knightley O
is O
coming O
too. O
 O
Well, O
that O
is O
so O
very! O
-- O
I O
am O
sure O
if O
Jane O
is O
tired, O
you O
will O
be O
so O
kind O
as O
to O
give O
her O
your O
arm.-- O
Mr. O
Elton, O
and O
Miss O
Hawkins!-- O
Good O
morning O
to O
you." O
Emma, O
alone O
with O
her O
father, O
had O
half O
her O
attention O
wanted O
by O
him O
while O
he O
lamented O
that O
young O
people O
would O
be O
in O
such O
a O
hurry O
to O
marry-- O
and O
to O
marry O
strangers O
too-- O
and O
the O
other O
half O
she O
could O
give O
to O
her O
own O
view O
of O
the O
subject. O
 O
It O
was O
to O
herself O
an O
amusing O
and O
a O
very O
welcome O
piece O
of O
news, O
as O
proving O
that O
Mr. O
Elton O
could O
not O
have O
suffered O
long; O
but O
she O
was O
sorry O
for O
Harriet: O
Harriet O
must O
feel O
it-- O
and O
all O
that O
she O
could O
hope O
was, O
by O
giving O
the O
first O
information O
herself, O
to O
save O
her O
from O
hearing O
it O
abruptly O
from O
others. O
 O
It O
was O
now O
about O
the O
time O
that O
she O
was O
likely O
to O
call. O
 O
If O
she O
were O
to O
meet O
Miss O
Bates O
in O
her O
way!-- O
and O
upon O
its O
beginning O
to O
rain, O
Emma O
was O
obliged O
to O
expect O
that O
the O
weather O
would O
be O
detaining O
her O
at O
Mrs. O
Goddard's, O
and O
that O
the O
intelligence O
would O
undoubtedly O
rush O
upon O
her O
without O
preparation. O
The O
shower O
was O
heavy, O
but O
short; O
and O
it O
had O
not O
been O
over O
five O
minutes, O
when O
in O
came O
Harriet, O
with O
just O
the O
heated, O
agitated O
look O
which O
hurrying O
thither O
with O
a O
full O
heart O
was O
likely O
to O
give; O
and O
the O
"Oh! O
Miss O
Woodhouse, O
what O
do O
you O
think O
has O
happened!" O
which O
instantly O
burst O
forth, O
had O
all O
the O
evidence O
of O
corresponding O
perturbation. O
 O
As O
the O
blow O
was O
given, O
Emma O
felt O
that O
she O
could O
not O
now O
shew O
greater O
kindness O
than O
in O
listening; O
and O
Harriet, O
unchecked, O
ran O
eagerly O
through O
what O
she O
had O
to O
tell. O
 O
"She O
had O
set O
out O
from O
Mrs. O
Goddard's O
half O
an O
hour O
ago-- O
she O
had O
been O
afraid O
it O
would O
rain-- O
she O
had O
been O
afraid O
it O
would O
pour O
down O
every O
moment-- O
but O
she O
thought O
she O
might O
get O
to O
Hartfield O
first-- O
she O
had O
hurried O
on O
as O
fast O
as O
possible; O
but O
then, O
as O
she O
was O
passing O
by O
the O
house O
where O
a O
young O
woman O
was O
making O
up O
a O
gown O
for O
her, O
she O
thought O
she O
would O
just O
step O
in O
and O
see O
how O
it O
went O
on; O
and O
though O
she O
did O
not O
seem O
to O
stay O
half O
a O
moment O
there, O
soon O
after O
she O
came O
out O
it O
began O
to O
rain, O
and O
she O
did O
not O
know O
what O
to O
do; O
so O
she O
ran O
on O
directly, O
as O
fast O
as O
she O
could, O
and O
took O
shelter O
at O
Ford's."-- O
Ford's O
was O
the O
principal O
woollen-draper, O
linen-draper, O
and O
haberdasher's O
shop O
united; O
the O
shop O
first O
in O
size O
and O
fashion O
in O
the O
place.-- O
"And O
so, O
there O
she O
had O
set, O
without O
an O
idea O
of O
any O
thing O
in O
the O
world, O
full O
ten O
minutes, O
perhaps-- O
when, O
all O
of O
a O
sudden, O
who O
should O
come O
in-- O
to O
be O
sure O
it O
was O
so O
very O
odd!-- O
but O
they O
always O
dealt O
at O
Ford's-- O
who O
should O
come O
in, O
but O
Elizabeth O
Martin O
and O
her O
brother!-- O
Dear O
Miss O
Woodhouse! O
only O
think. O
 O
I O
thought O
I O
should O
have O
fainted. O
 O
I O
did O
not O
know O
what O
to O
do. O
 O
I O
was O
sitting O
near O
the O
door-- O
Elizabeth O
saw O
me O
directly; O
but O
he O
did O
not; O
he O
was O
busy O
with O
the O
umbrella. O
 O
I O
am O
sure O
she O
saw O
me, O
but O
she O
looked O
away O
directly, O
and O
took O
no O
notice; O
and O
they O
both O
went O
to O
quite O
the O
farther O
end O
of O
the O
shop; O
and O
I O
kept O
sitting O
near O
the O
door!-- O
Oh! O
dear; O
I O
was O
so O
miserable! O
 O
I O
am O
sure O
I O
must O
have O
been O
as O
white O
as O
my O
gown. O
 O
I O
could O
not O
go O
away O
you O
know, O
because O
of O
the O
rain; O
but O
I O
did O
so O
wish O
myself O
anywhere O
in O
the O
world O
but O
there.-- O
Oh! O
dear, O
Miss O
Woodhouse-- O
well, O
at O
last, O
I O
fancy, O
he O
looked O
round O
and O
saw O
me; O
for O
instead O
of O
going O
on O
with O
her O
buyings, O
they O
began O
whispering O
to O
one O
another. O
 O
I O
am O
sure O
they O
were O
talking O
of O
me; O
and O
I O
could O
not O
help O
thinking O
that O
he O
was O
persuading O
her O
to O
speak O
to O
me-- O
(do O
you O
think O
he O
was, O
Miss O
Woodhouse?)-- O
for O
presently O
she O
came O
forward-- O
came O
quite O
up O
to O
me, O
and O
asked O
me O
how O
I O
did, O
and O
seemed O
ready O
to O
shake O
hands, O
if O
I O
would. O
 O
She O
did O
not O
do O
any O
of O
it O
in O
the O
same O
way O
that O
she O
used; O
I O
could O
see O
she O
was O
altered; O
but, O
however, O
she O
seemed O
to O
try O
to O
be O
very O
friendly, O
and O
we O
shook O
hands, O
and O
stood O
talking O
some O
time; O
but O
I O
know O
no O
more O
what O
I O
said O
-- O
I O
was O
in O
such O
a O
tremble! O
-- O
I O
remember O
she O
said O
she O
was O
sorry O
we O
never O
met O
now; O
which O
I O
thought O
almost O
too O
kind! O
 O
Dear, O
Miss O
Woodhouse, O
I O
was O
absolutely O
miserable! O
 O
By O
that O
time, O
it O
was O
beginning O
to O
hold O
up, O
and O
I O
was O
determined O
that O
nothing O
should O
stop O
me O
from O
getting O
away-- O
and O
then-- O
only O
think!-- O
I O
found O
he O
was O
coming O
up O
towards O
me O
too-- O
slowly O
you O
know, O
and O
as O
if O
he O
did O
not O
quite O
know O
what O
to O
do; O
and O
so O
he O
came O
and O
spoke, O
and O
I O
answered-- O
and O
I O
stood O
for O
a O
minute, O
feeling O
dreadfully, O
you O
know, O
one O
can't O
tell O
how; O
and O
then O
I O
took O
courage, O
and O
said O
it O
did O
not O
rain, O
and O
I O
must O
go; O
and O
so O
off O
I O
set; O
and O
I O
had O
not O
got O
three O
yards O
from O
the O
door, O
when O
he O
came O
after O
me, O
only O
to O
say, O
if O
I O
was O
going O
to O
Hartfield, O
he O
thought O
I O
had O
much O
better O
go O
round O
by O
Mr. O
Cole's O
stables, O
for O
I O
should O
find O
the O
near O
way O
quite O
floated O
by O
this O
rain. O
Oh! O
dear, O
I O
thought O
it O
would O
have O
been O
the O
death O
of O
me! O
 O
So O
I O
said, O
I O
was O
very O
much O
obliged O
to O
him: O
 O
you O
know O
I O
could O
not O
do O
less; O
and O
then O
he O
went O
back O
to O
Elizabeth, O
and O
I O
came O
round O
by O
the O
stables O
-- O
I O
believe O
I O
did-- O
but O
I O
hardly O
knew O
where O
I O
was, O
or O
any O
thing O
about O
it. O
 O
Oh! O
 O
Miss O
Woodhouse, O
I O
would O
rather O
done O
any O
thing O
than O
have O
it O
happen: O
 O
and O
yet, O
you O
know, O
there O
was O
a O
sort O
of O
satisfaction O
in O
seeing O
him O
behave O
so O
pleasantly O
and O
so O
kindly. O
 O
And O
Elizabeth, O
too. O
 O
Oh! O
 O
Miss O
Woodhouse, O
do O
talk O
to O
me O
and O
make O
me O
comfortable O
again." O
Very O
sincerely O
did O
Emma O
wish O
to O
do O
so; O
but O
it O
was O
not O
immediately O
in O
her O
power. O
 O
She O
was O
obliged O
to O
stop O
and O
think. O
 O
She O
was O
not O
thoroughly O
comfortable O
herself. O
 O
The O
young O
man's O
conduct, O
and O
his O
sister's, O
seemed O
the O
result O
of O
real O
feeling, O
and O
she O
could O
not O
but O
pity O
them. O
 O
As O
Harriet O
described O
it, O
there O
had O
been O
an O
interesting O
mixture O
of O
wounded O
affection O
and O
genuine O
delicacy O
in O
their O
behaviour. O
 O
But O
she O
had O
believed O
them O
to O
be O
well-meaning, O
worthy O
people O
before; O
and O
what O
difference O
did O
this O
make O
in O
the O
evils O
of O
the O
connexion? O
 O
It O
was O
folly O
to O
be O
disturbed O
by O
it. O
 O
Of O
course, O
he O
must O
be O
sorry O
to O
lose O
her-- O
they O
must O
be O
all O
sorry. O
 O
Ambition, O
as O
well O
as O
love, O
had O
probably O
been O
mortified. O
 O
They O
might O
all O
have O
hoped O
to O
rise O
by O
Harriet's O
acquaintance: O
 O
and O
besides, O
what O
was O
the O
value O
of O
Harriet's O
description?-- O
So O
easily O
pleased-- O
so O
little O
discerning;-- O
what O
signified O
her O
praise? O
She O
exerted O
herself, O
and O
did O
try O
to O
make O
her O
comfortable, O
by O
considering O
all O
that O
had O
passed O
as O
a O
mere O
trifle, O
and O
quite O
unworthy O
of O
being O
dwelt O
on, O
"It O
might O
be O
distressing, O
for O
the O
moment," O
said O
she; O
"but O
you O
seem O
to O
have O
behaved O
extremely O
well; O
and O
it O
is O
over-- O
and O
may O
never-- O
can O
never, O
as O
a O
first O
meeting, O
occur O
again, O
and O
therefore O
you O
need O
not O
think O
about O
it." O
Harriet O
said, O
"very O
true," O
and O
she O
"would O
not O
think O
about O
it;" O
but O
still O
she O
talked O
of O
it-- O
still O
she O
could O
talk O
of O
nothing O
else; O
and O
Emma, O
at O
last, O
in O
order O
to O
put O
the O
Martins O
out O
of O
her O
head, O
was O
obliged O
to O
hurry O
on O
the O
news, O
which O
she O
had O
meant O
to O
give O
with O
so O
much O
tender O
caution; O
hardly O
knowing O
herself O
whether O
to O
rejoice O
or O
be O
angry, O
ashamed O
or O
only O
amused, O
at O
such O
a O
state O
of O
mind O
in O
poor O
Harriet-- O
such O
a O
conclusion O
of O
Mr. O
Elton's O
importance O
with O
her! O
Mr. O
Elton's O
rights, O
however, O
gradually O
revived. O
 O
Though O
she O
did O
not O
feel O
the O
first O
intelligence O
as O
she O
might O
have O
done O
the O
day O
before, O
or O
an O
hour O
before, O
its O
interest O
soon O
increased; O
and O
before O
their O
first O
conversation O
was O
over, O
she O
had O
talked O
herself O
into O
all O
the O
sensations O
of O
curiosity, O
wonder O
and O
regret, O
pain O
and O
pleasure, O
as O
to O
this O
fortunate O
Miss O
Hawkins, O
which O
could O
conduce O
to O
place O
the O
Martins O
under O
proper O
subordination O
in O
her O
fancy. O
Emma O
learned O
to O
be O
rather O
glad O
that O
there O
had O
been O
such O
a O
meeting. O
 O
It O
had O
been O
serviceable O
in O
deadening O
the O
first O
shock, O
without O
retaining O
any O
influence O
to O
alarm. O
 O
As O
Harriet O
now O
lived, O
the O
Martins O
could O
not O
get O
at O
her, O
without O
seeking O
her, O
where O
hitherto O
they O
had O
wanted O
either O
the O
courage O
or O
the O
condescension O
to O
seek O
her; O
for O
since O
her O
refusal O
of O
the O
brother, O
the O
sisters O
never O
had O
been O
at O
Mrs. O
Goddard's; O
and O
a O
twelvemonth O
might O
pass O
without O
their O
being O
thrown O
together O
again, O
with O
any O
necessity, O
or O
even O
any O
power O
of O
speech. O
 O
 O

 O
THE O
LADY O
WITH O
THE O
DOG O
I O
IT O
was O
said O
that O
a O
new O
person O
had O
appeared O
on O
the O
sea-front: O
a O
lady O
with O
a O
little O
dog. O
Dmitri O
Dmitritch O
Gurov, O
who O
had O
by O
then O
been O
a O
fortnight O
at O
Yalta, O
and O
so O
was O
fairly O
at O
home O
there, O
had O
begun O
to O
take O
an O
interest O
in O
new O
arrivals. O
Sitting O
in O
Verney's O
pavilion, O
he O
saw, O
walking O
on O
the O
sea-front, O
a O
fair-haired O
young O
lady O
of O
medium O
height, O
wearing O
a O
béret; O
a O
white O
Pomeranian O
dog O
was O
running O
behind O
her. O
And O
afterwards O
he O
met O
her O
in O
the O
public O
gardens O
and O
in O
the O
square O
several O
times O
a O
day. O
She O
was O
walking O
alone, O
always O
wearing O
the O
same O
béret, O
and O
always O
with O
the O
same O
white O
dog; O
no O
one O
knew O
who O
she O
was, O
and O
every Entity
one Entity
called Cue
her Entity
simply O
"the Quotation
lady Quotation
with Quotation
the Quotation
dog." Quotation
"If Quotation
she Quotation
is Quotation
here Quotation
alone Quotation
without Quotation
a Quotation
husband Quotation
or Quotation
friends, Quotation
it Quotation
wouldn't Quotation
be Quotation
amiss Quotation
to Quotation
make Quotation
her Quotation
acquaintance," Quotation
Gurov Entity
reflected. Cue
He O
was O
under O
forty, O
but O
he O
had O
a O
daughter O
already O
twelve O
years O
old, O
and O
two O
sons O
at O
school. O
He O
had O
been O
married O
young, O
when O
he O
was O
a O
student O
in O
his O
second O
year, O
and O
by O
now O
his O
wife O
seemed O
half O
as O
old O
again O
as O
he. O
She O
was O
a O
tall, O
erect O
woman O
with O
dark O
eyebrows, O
staid O
and O
dignified, O
and, O
as O
she O
said O
of O
herself, O
intellectual. O
She O
read O
a O
great O
deal, O
used O
phonetic O
spelling, O
called O
her O
husband, O
not O
Dmitri, O
but O
Dimitri, O
and O
he O
secretly O
considered O
her O
unintelligent, O
narrow, O
inelegant, O
was O
afraid O
of O
her, O
and O
did O
not O
like O
to O
be O
at O
home. O
He Entity
had O
begun O
being O
unfaithful O
to O
her O
long O
ago-- O
had O
been O
unfaithful O
to O
her O
often, O
and, O
probably O
on O
that O
account, O
almost O
always O
spoke O
ill O
of O
women, O
and O
when O
they O
were O
talked O
about O
in O
his O
presence, O
used O
to O
call Cue
them Entity
"the Quotation
lower Quotation
race." Quotation
It O
seemed O
to O
him O
that O
he O
had O
been O
so O
schooled O
by O
bitter O
experience O
that O
he O
might O
call O
them O
what O
he O
liked, O
and O
yet O
he O
could O
not O
get O
on O
for O
two O
days O
together O
without O
"the O
lower O
race." O
In O
the O
society O
of O
men O
he O
was O
bored O
and O
not O
himself, O
with O
them O
he O
was O
cold O
and O
uncommunicative; O
but O
when O
he O
was O
in O
the O
company O
of O
women O
he O
felt O
free, O
and O
knew O
what O
to O
say O
to O
them O
and O
how O
to O
behave; O
and O
he O
was O
at O
ease O
with O
them O
even O
when O
he O
was O
silent. O
In O
his O
appearance, O
in O
his O
character, O
in O
his O
whole O
nature, O
there O
was O
something O
attractive O
and O
elusive O
which O
allured O
women O
and O
disposed O
them O
in O
his O
favour; O
he O
knew O
that, O
and O
some O
force O
seemed O
to O
draw O
him, O
too, O
to O
them. O
Experience O
often O
repeated, O
truly O
bitter O
experience, O
had O
taught O
him O
long O
ago O
that O
with O
decent O
people, O
especially O
Moscow O
people-- O
always O
slow O
to O
move O
and O
irresolute-- O
every O
intimacy, O
which O
at O
first O
so O
agreeably O
diversifies O
life O
and O
appears O
a O
light O
and O
charming O
adventure, O
inevitably O
grows O
into O
a O
regular O
problem O
of O
extreme O
intricacy, O
and O
in O
the O
long O
run O
the O
situation O
becomes O
unbearable. O
But O
at O
every O
fresh O
meeting O
with O
an O
interesting O
woman O
this O
experience O
seemed O
to O
slip O
out O
of O
his O
memory, O
and O
he O
was O
eager O
for O
life, O
and O
everything O
seemed O
simple O
and O
amusing. O
One O
evening O
he O
was O
dining O
in O
the O
gardens, O
and O
the O
lady O
in O
the O
béret O
came O
up O
slowly O
to O
take O
the O
next O
table. O
Her O
expression, O
her O
gait, O
her O
dress, O
and O
the O
way O
she O
did O
her O
hair O
told O
him O
that O
she O
was O
a O
lady, O
that O
she O
was O
married, O
that O
she O
was O
in O
Yalta O
for O
the O
first O
time O
and O
alone, O
and O
that O
she O
was O
dull O
there. O
. O
. O
. O
The O
stories O
told O
of O
the O
immorality O
in O
such O
places O
as O
Yalta O
are O
to O
a O
great O
extent O
untrue; O
he O
despised O
them, O
and O
knew O
that O
such O
stories O
were O
for O
the O
most O
part O
made O
up O
by O
persons O
who O
would O
themselves O
have O
been O
glad O
to O
sin O
if O
they O
had O
been O
able; O
but O
when O
the O
lady O
sat O
down O
at O
the O
next O
table O
three O
paces O
from O
him, O
he O
remembered O
these O
tales O
of O
easy O
conquests, O
of O
trips O
to O
the O
mountains, O
and O
the O
tempting O
thought O
of O
a O
swift, O
fleeting O
love O
affair, O
a O
romance O
with O
an O
unknown O
woman, O
whose O
name O
he O
did O
not O
know, O
suddenly O
took O
possession O
of O
him. O
He O
beckoned O
coaxingly O
to O
the O
Pomeranian, O
and O
when O
the O
dog O
came O
up O
to O
him O
he O
shook O
his O
finger O
at O
it. O
The O
Pomeranian O
growled: O
Gurov O
shook O
his O
finger O
at O
it O
again. O
The O
lady O
looked O
at O
him Entity
and O
at O
once O
dropped O
her O
eyes. O
"He Quotation
doesn't Quotation
bite," Quotation
she Entity
said, Cue
and O
blushed. O
"May Quotation
I Quotation
give Quotation
him Quotation
a Quotation
bone?" Quotation
he Entity
asked; Cue
and O
when O
she Entity
nodded O
he Entity
asked Cue
courteously, O
"Have Quotation
you Quotation
been Quotation
long Quotation
in Quotation
Yalta?" Quotation
"Five Quotation
days." Quotation
"And Quotation
I Quotation
have Quotation
already Quotation
dragged Quotation
out Quotation
a Quotation
fortnight Quotation
here." Quotation
There O
was O
a O
brief O
silence. O
"Time Quotation
goes Quotation
fast, Quotation
and Quotation
yet Quotation
it Quotation
is Quotation
so Quotation
dull Quotation
here!" Quotation
she Entity
said, Cue
not O
looking O
at O
him. Entity
"That's Quotation
only Quotation
the Quotation
fashion Quotation
to Quotation
say Quotation
it Quotation
is Quotation
dull Quotation
here. Quotation
A Quotation
provincial Quotation
will Quotation
live Quotation
in Quotation
Belyov Quotation
or Quotation
Zhidra Quotation
and Quotation
not Quotation
be Quotation
dull, Quotation
and Quotation
when Quotation
he Quotation
comes Quotation
here Quotation
it's Quotation
'Oh, Quotation
the Quotation
dulness! Quotation
Oh, Quotation
the Quotation
dust!' Quotation
One Quotation
would Quotation
think Quotation
he Quotation
came Quotation
from Quotation
Grenada." Quotation
She O
laughed. O
Then O
both O
continued O
eating O
in O
silence, O
like O
strangers, O
but O
after O
dinner O
they O
walked O
side O
by O
side; O
and O
there O
sprang O
up O
between O
them O
the O
light O
jesting O
conversation O
of O
people O
who O
are O
free O
and O
satisfied, O
to O
whom O
it O
does O
not O
matter O
where O
they O
go O
or O
what O
they O
talk O
about. O
They Entity
walked O
and O
talked Cue
of Quotation
the Quotation
strange Quotation
light Quotation
on Quotation
the Quotation
sea: Quotation
the Quotation
water Quotation
was Quotation
of Quotation
a Quotation
soft Quotation
warm Quotation
lilac Quotation
hue, Quotation
and Quotation
there Quotation
was Quotation
a Quotation
golden Quotation
streak Quotation
from Quotation
the Quotation
moon Quotation
upon Quotation
it. Quotation
They Entity
talked Cue
of Quotation
how Quotation
sultry Quotation
it Quotation
was Quotation
after Quotation
a Quotation
hot Quotation
day. Quotation
Gurov Entity
told Cue
her Entity
that Quotation
he Quotation
came Quotation
from Quotation
Moscow, Quotation
that Quotation
he Quotation
had Quotation
taken Quotation
his Quotation
degree Quotation
in Quotation
Arts, Quotation
but Quotation
had Quotation
a Quotation
post Quotation
in Quotation
a Quotation
bank; Quotation
that Quotation
he Quotation
had Quotation
trained Quotation
as Quotation
an Quotation
opera-singer, Quotation
but Quotation
had Quotation
given Quotation
it Quotation
up, Quotation
that Quotation
he Quotation
owned Quotation
two Quotation
houses Quotation
in Quotation
Moscow. Quotation
. O
. O
. O
And O
from O
her O
he O
learnt O
that O
she O
had O
grown O
up O
in O
Petersburg, O
but O
had O
lived O
in O
S-- O
since O
her O
marriage O
two O
years O
before, O
that O
she O
was O
staying O
another O
month O
in O
Yalta, O
and O
that O
her O
husband, O
who O
needed O
a O
holiday O
too, O
might O
perhaps O
come O
and O
fetch O
her. O
She O
was O
not O
sure O
whether O
her O
husband O
had O
a O
post O
in O
a O
Crown O
Department O
or O
under O
the O
Provincial O
Council-- O
and O
was O
amused O
by O
her O
own O
ignorance. O
And O
Gurov O
learnt, O
too, O
that O
she O
was O
called O
Anna O
Sergeyevna. O
Afterwards O
he O
thought O
about O
her O
in O
his O
room O
at O
the O
hotel-- O
thought O
she O
would O
certainly O
meet O
him O
next O
day; O
it O
would O
be O
sure O
to O
happen. O
As O
he O
got O
into O
bed O
he O
thought O
how O
lately O
she O
had O
been O
a O
girl O
at O
school, O
doing O
lessons O
like O
his O
own O
daughter; O
he O
recalled O
the O
diffidence, O
the O
angularity, O
that O
was O
still O
manifest O
in O
her O
laugh O
and O
her O
manner O
of O
talking O
with O
a O
stranger. O
This O
must O
have O
been O
the O
first O
time O
in O
her O
life O
she O
had O
been O
alone O
in O
surroundings O
in O
which O
she O
was O
followed, O
looked O
at, O
and O
spoken O
to O
merely O
from O
a O
secret O
motive O
which O
she O
could O
hardly O
fail O
to O
guess. O
He O
recalled O
her O
slender, O
delicate O
neck, O
her O
lovely O
grey O
eyes. O
"There's O
something O
pathetic O
about O
her, O
anyway," O
he O
thought, O
and O
fell O
asleep. O
II O
A O
week O
had O
passed O
since O
they O
had O
made O
acquaintance. O
It O
was O
a O
holiday. O
It O
was O
sultry O
indoors, O
while O
in O
the O
street O
the O
wind O
whirled O
the O
dust O
round O
and O
round, O
and O
blew O
people's O
hats O
off. O
It O
was O
a O
thirsty O
day, O
and O
Gurov O
often O
went O
into O
the O
pavilion, O
and O
pressed O
Anna O
Sergeyevna O
to O
have O
syrup O
and O
water O
or O
an O
ice. O
One O
did O
not O
know O
what O
to O
do O
with O
oneself. O
In O
the O
evening O
when O
the O
wind O
had O
dropped O
a O
little, O
they O
went O
out O
on O
the O
groyne O
to O
see O
the O
steamer O
come O
in. O
There O
were O
a O
great O
many O
people O
walking O
about O
the O
harbour; O
they O
had O
gathered O
to O
welcome O
some O
one, O
bringing O
bouquets. O
And O
two O
peculiarities O
of O
a O
well-dressed O
Yalta O
crowd O
were O
very O
conspicuous: O
the O
elderly O
ladies O
were O
dressed O
like O
young O
ones, O
and O
there O
were O
great O
numbers O
of O
generals. O
Owing O
to O
the O
roughness O
of O
the O
sea, O
the O
steamer O
arrived O
late, O
after O
the O
sun O
had O
set, O
and O
it O
was O
a O
long O
time O
turning O
about O
before O
it O
reached O
the O
groyne. O
Anna O
Sergeyevna O
looked O
through O
her O
lorgnette O
at O
the O
steamer O
and O
the O
passengers O
as O
though O
looking O
for O
acquaintances, O
and O
when O
she O
turned O
to O
Gurov Entity
her O
eyes O
were O
shining. O
She Entity
talked Cue
a Quotation
great Quotation
deal Quotation
and O
asked Cue
disconnected Quotation
questions, Quotation
forgetting O
next O
moment O
what O
she O
had O
asked; O
then O
she O
dropped O
her O
lorgnette O
in O
the O
crush. O
The O
festive O
crowd O
began O
to O
disperse; O
it O
was O
too O
dark O
to O
see O
people's O
faces. O
The O
wind O
had O
completely O
dropped, O
but O
Gurov O
and O
Anna O
Sergeyevna O
still O
stood O
as O
though O
waiting O
to O
see O
some O
one O
else O
come O
from O
the O
steamer. O
Anna Entity
Sergeyevna Entity
was O
silent O
now, O
and O
sniffed O
the O
flowers O
without O
looking O
at O
Gurov. O
"The Quotation
weather Quotation
is Quotation
better Quotation
this Quotation
evening," Quotation
he Entity
said. Cue
"Where Quotation
shall Quotation
we Quotation
go Quotation
now? Quotation
Shall Quotation
we Quotation
drive Quotation
somewhere?" Quotation
She O
made O
no O
answer. O
Then O
he O
looked O
at O
her O
intently, O
and O
all O
at O
once O
put O
his O
arm O
round O
her O
and O
kissed O
her Entity
on O
the O
lips, O
and O
breathed O
in O
the O
moisture O
and O
the O
fragrance O
of O
the O
flowers; O
and O
he O
immediately O
looked O
round O
him, O
anxiously O
wondering O
whether O
any O
one O
had O
seen O
them. O
"Let Quotation
us Quotation
go Quotation
to Quotation
your Quotation
hotel," Quotation
he Entity
said Cue
softly. O
And O
both O
walked O
quickly. O
The O
room O
was O
close O
and O
smelt O
of O
the O
scent O
she O
had O
bought O
at O
the O
Japanese O
shop. O
Gurov O
looked O
at O
her O
and O
thought: O
"What O
different O
people O
one O
meets O
in O
the O
world!" O
From O
the O
past O
he O
preserved O
memories O
of O
careless, O
good-natured O
women, O
who O
loved O
cheerfully O
and O
were O
grateful O
to O
him O
for O
the O
happiness O
he O
gave O
them, O
however O
brief O
it O
might O
be; O
and O
of O
women O
like O
his O
wife O
who O
loved O
without O
any O
genuine O
feeling, O
with O
superfluous O
phrases, O
affectedly, O
hysterically, O
with O
an O
expression O
that O
suggested O
that O
it O
was O
not O
love O
nor O
passion, O
but O
something O
more O
significant; O
and O
of O
two O
or O
three O
others, O
very O
beautiful, O
cold O
women, O
on O
whose O
faces O
he O
had O
caught O
a O
glimpse O
of O
a O
rapacious O
expression-- O
an O
obstinate O
desire O
to O
snatch O
from O
life O
more O
than O
it O
could O
give, O
and O
these O
were O
capricious, O
unreflecting, O
domineering, O
unintelligent O
women O
not O
in O
their O
first O
youth, O
and O
when O
Gurov O
grew O
cold O
to O
them O
their O
beauty O
excited O
his O
hatred, O
and O
the O
lace O
on O
their O
linen O
seemed O
to O
him O
like O
scales. O
But O
in O
this O
case O
there O
was O
still O
the O
diffidence, O
the O
angularity O
of O
inexperienced O
youth, O
an O
awkward O
feeling; O
and O
there O
was O
a O
sense O
of O
consternation O
as O
though O
some O
one O
had O
suddenly O
knocked O
at O
the O
door. O
The O
attitude O
of O
Anna O
Sergeyevna-- O
"the O
lady O
with O
the O
dog"-- O
to O
what O
had O
happened O
was O
somehow O
peculiar, O
very O
grave, O
as O
though O
it O
were O
her O
fall-- O
so O
it O
seemed, O
and O
it O
was O
strange O
and O
inappropriate. O
Her O
face O
dropped O
and O
faded, O
and O
on O
both O
sides O
of O
it O
her O
long O
hair O
hung O
down O
mournfully; O
she O
mused O
in O
a O
dejected O
attitude O
like O
"the O
woman O
who O
was O
a O
sinner" O
in O
an O
old-fashioned O
picture. O
"It's Quotation
wrong," Quotation
she Entity
said. Cue
"You Quotation
will Quotation
be Quotation
the Quotation
first Quotation
to Quotation
despise Quotation
me Quotation
now." Quotation
There O
was O
a O
water-melon O
on O
the O
table. O
Gurov Entity
cut O
himself O
a O
slice O
and O
began O
eating O
it O
without O
haste. O
There O
followed O
at O
least O
half O
an O
hour O
of O
silence. O
Anna Entity
Sergeyevna Entity
was O
touching; O
there O
was O
about O
her O
the O
purity O
of O
a O
good, O
simple O
woman O
who O
had O
seen O
little O
of O
life. O
The O
solitary O
candle O
burning O
on O
the O
table O
threw O
a O
faint O
light O
on O
her O
face, O
yet O
it O
was O
clear O
that O
she O
was O
very O
unhappy. O
"How Quotation
could Quotation
I Quotation
despise Quotation
you?" Quotation
asked Cue
Gurov. Entity
"You Quotation
don't Quotation
know Quotation
what Quotation
you Quotation
are Quotation
saying." Quotation
"God Quotation
forgive Quotation
me," Quotation
she Entity
said, Cue
and O
her O
eyes O
filled O
with O
tears. O
"It's Quotation
awful." Quotation
"You Quotation
seem Quotation
to Quotation
feel Quotation
you Quotation
need Quotation
to Quotation
be Quotation
forgiven." Quotation
"Forgiven? Quotation
No. Quotation
I Quotation
am Quotation
a Quotation
bad, Quotation
low Quotation
woman; Quotation
I Quotation
despise Quotation
myself Quotation

It's Quotation
not Quotation
my Quotation

myself Quotation

not Quotation

I Quotation
have Quotation
been Quotation

I Quotation
wanted Quotation
something Quotation

'There Quotation

I Quotation
said Quotation

Gurov Entity
felt O
bored O
already, O
listening O
to O
her. O
He O
was O
irritated O
by O
the O
naïve O
tone, O
by O
this O
remorse, O
so O
unexpected O
and O
inopportune; O
but O
for O
the O
tears O
in O
her O
eyes, O
he O
might O
have O
thought O
she O
was O
jesting O
or O
playing O
a O
part. O
"I Quotation
don't Quotation

he Entity
said Cue
softly. O
"What Quotation
is Quotation
it Quotation
you Quotation

She Entity
hid O
her O
face O
on O
his O

pressed O
close O
to O
him. O
"Believe Quotation

He O
looked O
at O
her Entity
fixed, O
scared O

her, O
talked O
softly O
and O
affectionately, O
and O
by O
degrees O
she O
was O
comforted, O
and O
her O
gaiety O
returned; O
they O
both O
began O
laughing. O
Afterwards O
when O
they O
went O
out O
there O
was O
not O
a O
soul O
on O
the O
sea-front. O
The O
town O
with O
its O
cypresses O
had O
quite O
a O
deathlike O
air, O
but O
the O
sea O
still O
broke O
noisily O
on O
the O
shore; O
a O
single O
barge O
was O
rocking O
on O
the O
waves, O
and O
a O
lantern O
was O
blinking O
sleepily O
on O
it. O
They O
found O
a O
cab O
and O
drove O
to O
Oreanda. O
"I Quotation
found Quotation
out Quotation
your Quotation
surname Quotation
in Quotation
the Quotation
hall Quotation
just Quotation
now: Quotation
it Quotation
was Quotation
written Quotation
on Quotation
the Quotation
board-- Quotation
Von Quotation
Diderits," Quotation
said Cue
Gurov. Entity
"Is Quotation
your Quotation
husband Quotation
a Quotation
German?" Quotation
"No; Quotation
I Quotation
believe Quotation
his Quotation
grandfather Quotation
was Quotation
a Quotation
German, Quotation
but Quotation
he Quotation
is Quotation
an Quotation
Orthodox Quotation
Russian Quotation
himself." Quotation
At O
Oreanda O
they O
sat O
on O
a O
seat O
not O
far O
from O
the O
church, O
looked O
down O
at O
the O
sea, O
and O
were O
silent. O
Yalta O
was O
hardly O
visible O
through O
the O
morning O
mist; O
white O
clouds O
stood O
motionless O
on O
the O
mountain-tops. O
The O
leaves O
did O
not O
stir O
on O
the O
trees, O
grasshoppers O
chirruped, O
and O
the O
monotonous O
hollow O
sound O
of O
the O
sea O
rising O
up O
from O
below, O
spoke O
of O
the O
peace, O
of O
the O
eternal O
sleep O
awaiting O
us. O
So O
it O
must O
have O
sounded O
when O
there O
was O
no O
Yalta, O
no O
Oreanda O
here; O
so O
it O
sounds O
now, O
and O
it O
will O
sound O
as O
indifferently O
and O
monotonously O
when O
we O
are O
all O
no O
more. O
And O
in O
this O
constancy, O
in O
this O
complete O
indifference O
to O
the O
life O
and O
death O
of O
each O
of O
us, O
there O
lies O
hid, O
perhaps, O
a O
pledge O
of O
our O
eternal O
salvation, O
of O
the O
unceasing O
movement O
of O
life O
upon O
earth, O
of O
unceasing O
progress O
towards O
perfection. O
Sitting O
beside O
a O
young O
woman O
who O
in O
the O
dawn O
seemed O
so O
lovely, O
soothed O
and O
spellbound O
in O
these O
magical O
surroundings-- O
the O
sea, O
mountains, O
clouds, O
the O
open O
sky-- O
Gurov Entity
thought O
how O
in O
reality O
everything O
is O
beautiful O
in O
this O
world O
when O
one O
reflects: O
everything O
except O
what O
we O
think O
or O
do O
ourselves O
when O
we O
forget O
our O
human O
dignity O
and O
the O
higher O
aims O
of O
our O
existence. O
A O
man O
walked O
up O
to O
them-- O
probably O
a O
keeper-- O
looked O
at O
them O
and O
walked O
away. O
And O
this O
detail O
seemed O
mysterious O
and O
beautiful, O
too. O
They O
saw O
a O
steamer O
come O
from O
Theodosia, O
with O
its O
lights O
out O
in O
the O
glow O
of O
dawn. O
"There Quotation
is Quotation
dew Quotation
on Quotation
the Quotation
grass," Quotation
said Cue
Anna Entity
Sergeyevna, Entity
after O
a O
silence. O
"Yes. Quotation
It's Quotation
time Quotation
to Quotation
go Quotation
home." Quotation
They O
went O
back O
to O
the O
town. O
Then O
they O
met O
every O
day O
at O
twelve O
o'clock O
on O
the O
sea-front, O
lunched O
and O
dined O
together, O
went O
for O
walks, O
admired O
the O
sea. O
She Entity
complained Cue
that Quotation
she Quotation
slept Quotation
badly, Quotation
that Quotation
her Quotation
heart Quotation
throbbed Quotation
violently; Quotation
asked Quotation
the Quotation
same Quotation
questions, Quotation
troubled O
now O
by O
jealousy O
and O
now O
by O
the O
fear O
that O
he O
did O
not O
respect O
her O
sufficiently. O
And O
often O
in O
the O
square O
or O
gardens, O
when O
there O
was O
no O
one O
near O
them, O
he O
suddenly O
drew O
her O
to O
him O
and O
kissed O
her O
passionately. O
Complete O
idleness, O
these O
kisses O
in O
broad O
daylight O
while O
he O
looked O
round O
in O
dread O
of O
some O
one's O
seeing O
them, O
the O
heat, O
the O
smell O
of O
the O
sea, O
and O
the O
continual O
passing O
to O
and O
fro O
before O
him O
of O
idle, O
well-dressed, O
well-fed O
people, O
made O
a O
new O
man O
of O
him; O
he Entity
told Cue
Anna Entity
Sergeyevna Entity
how Quotation
beautiful Quotation
she Quotation
was, Quotation
how Quotation
fascinating. Quotation
He O
was O
impatiently O
passionate, O
he Entity
would O
not O
move O
a O
step O
away O
from O
her, O
while O
she Entity
was O
often O
pensive O
and O
continually Cue
urged Cue
him O
to O
confess O
that O
he O
did O
not O
respect O
her, O
did O
not O
love O
her O
in O
the O
least, O
and O
thought O
of O
her O
as O
nothing O
but O
a O
common O
woman. O
Rather O
late O
almost O
every O
evening O
they O
drove O
somewhere O
out O
of O
town, O
to O
Oreanda O
or O
to O
the O
waterfall; O
and O
the O
expedition O
was O
always O
a O
success, O
the O
scenery O
invariably O
impressed O
them O
as O
grand O
and O
beautiful. O
They O
were O
expecting O
her O
husband O
to O
come, O
but O
a O
letter O
came O
from O
him, O
saying O
that O
there O
was O
something O
wrong O
with O
his O
eyes, O
and O
he O
entreated O
his O
wife O
to O
come O
home O
as O
quickly O
as O
possible. O
Anna O
Sergeyevna O
made O
haste O
to O
go. O
"It's O
a O
good O
thing O
I O
am O
going O
away," O
she O
said O
to O
Gurov. O
"It's O
the O
finger O
of O
destiny!" O
She O
went O
by O
coach O
and O
he O
went O
with O
her. O
They O
were O
driving O
the O
whole O
day. O
When O
she O
had O
got O
into O
a O
compartment O
of O
the O
express, O
and O
when O
the O
second O
bell O
had O
rung, O
she O
said: O
"Let O
me O
look O
at O
you O
once O
more O
. O
. O
. O
look O
at O
you O
once O
again. O
That's O
right." O
She O
did O
not O
shed O
tears, O
but O
was O
so O
sad O
that O
she O
seemed O
ill, O
and O
her O
face O
was O
quivering. O
"I O
shall O
remember O
you O
. O
. O
. O
think O
of O
you," O
she O
said. O
"God O
be O
with O
you; O
be O
happy. O
Don't O
remember O
evil O
against O
me. O
We O
are O
parting O
forever O
--it O
must O
be O
so, O
for O
we O
ought O
never O
to O
have O
met. O
Well, O
God O
be O
with O
you." O
The O
train O
moved O
off O
rapidly, O
its O
lights O
soon O
vanished O
from O
sight, O
and O
a O
minute O
later O
there O
was O
no O
sound O
of O
it, O
as O
though O
everything O
had O
conspired O
together O
to O
end O
as O
quickly O
as O
possible O
that O
sweet O
delirium, O
that O
madness. O
Left O
alone O
on O
the O
platform, O
and O
gazing O
into O
the O
dark O
distance, O
Gurov O
listened O
to O
the O
chirrup O
of O
the O
grasshoppers O
and O
the O
hum O
of O
the O
telegraph O
wires, O
feeling O
as O
though O
he O
had O
only O
just O
waked O
up. O
And O
he O
thought, O
musing, O
that O
there O
had O
been O
another O
episode O
or O
adventure O
in O
his O
life, O
and O
it, O
too, O
was O
at O
an O
end, O
and O
nothing O
was O
left O
of O
it O
but O
a O
memory. O
. O
. O
. O
He O
was O
moved, O
sad, O
and O
conscious O
of O
a O
slight O
remorse. O
This O
young O
woman O
whom O
he O
would O
never O
meet O
again O
had O
not O
been O
happy O
with O
him; O
he O
was O
genuinely O
warm O
and O
affectionate O
with O
her, O
but O
yet O
in O
his O
manner, O
his O
tone, O
and O
his O
caresses O
there O
had O
been O
a O
shade O
of O
light O
irony, O
the O
coarse O
condescension O
of O
a O
happy O
man O
who O
was, O
besides, O
almost O
twice O
her O
age. O
All O
the O
time O
she O
had O
called O
him O
kind, O
exceptional, O
lofty; O
obviously O
he O
had O
seemed O
to O
her O
different O
from O
what O
he O
really O
was, O
so O
he O
had O
unintentionally O
deceived O
her. O
. O
. O
. O
Here O
at O
the O
station O
was O
already O
a O
scent O
of O
autumn; O
it O
was O
a O
cold O
evening. O
"It's O
time O
for O
me O
to O
go O
north," O
thought O
Gurov O
as O
he O
left O
the O
platform. O
"High O
time!" O
III O
At O
home O
in O
Moscow O
everything O
was O
in O
its O
winter O
routine; O
the O
stoves O
were O
heated, O
and O
in O
the O
morning O
it O
was O
still O
dark O
when O
the O
children O
were O
having O
breakfast O
and O
getting O
ready O
for O
school, O
and O
the O
nurse O
would O
light O
the O
lamp O
for O
a O
short O
time. O
The O
frosts O
had O
begun O
already. O
When O
the O
first O
snow O
has O
fallen, O
on O
the O
first O
day O
of O
sledge-driving O
it O
is O
pleasant O
to O
see O
the O
white O
earth, O
the O
white O
roofs, O
to O
draw O
soft, O
delicious O
breath, O
and O
the O
season O
brings O
back O
the O
days O
of O
one's O
youth. O
The O
old O
limes O
and O
birches, O
white O
with O
hoar-frost, O
have O
a O
good-natured O
expression; O
they O
are O
nearer O
to O
one's O
heart O
than O
cypresses O
and O
palms, O
and O
near O
them O
one O
doesn't O
want O
to O
be O
thinking O
of O
the O
sea O
and O
the O
mountains. O
Gurov O
was O
Moscow O
born; O
he O
arrived O
in O
Moscow O
on O
a O
fine O
frosty O
day, O
and O
when O
he O
put O
on O
his O
fur O
coat O
and O
warm O
gloves, O
and O
walked O
along O
Petrovka, O
and O
when O
on O
Saturday O
evening O
he O
heard O
the O
ringing O
of O
the O
bells, O
his O
recent O
trip O
and O
the O
places O
he O
had O
seen O
lost O
all O
charm O
for O
him. O
Little O
by O
little O
he O
became O
absorbed O
in O
Moscow O
life, O
greedily O
read O
three O
newspapers O
a O
day, O
and O
declared O
he O
did O
not O
read O
the O
Moscow O
papers O
on O
principle! O
He O
already O
felt O
a O
longing O
to O
go O
to O
restaurants, O
clubs, O
dinner-parties, O
anniversary O
celebrations, O
and O
he O
felt O
flattered O
at O
entertaining O
distinguished O
lawyers O
and O
artists, O
and O
at O
playing O
cards O
with O
a O
professor O
at O
the O
doctors' O
club. O
He O
could O
already O
eat O
a O
whole O
plateful O
of O
salt O
fish O
and O
cabbage. O
In O
another O
month, O
he O
fancied, O
the O
image O
of O
Anna O
Sergeyevna O
would O
be O
shrouded O
in O
a O
mist O
in O
his O
memory, O
and O
only O
from O
time O
to O
time O
would O
visit O
him O
in O
his O
dreams O
with O
a O
touching O
smile O
as O
others O
did. O
But O
more O
than O
a O
month O
passed, O
real O
winter O
had O
come, O
and O
everything O
was O
still O
clear O
in O
his O
memory O
as O
though O
he O
had O
parted O
with O
Anna O
Sergeyevna O
only O
the O
day O
before. O
And O
his O
memories O
glowed O
more O
and O
more O
vividly. O
When O
in O
the O
evening O
stillness O
he O
heard O
from O
his O
study O
the O
voices O
of O
his O
children, O
preparing O
their O
lessons, O
or O
when O
he O
listened O
to O
a O
song O
or O
the O
organ O
at O
the O
restaurant, O
or O
the O
storm O
howled O
in O
the O
chimney, O
suddenly O
everything O
would O
rise O
up O
in O
his O
memory: O
what O
had O
happened O
on O
the O
groyne, O
and O
the O
early O
morning O
with O
the O
mist O
on O
the O
mountains, O
and O
the O
steamer O
coming O
from O
Theodosia, O
and O
the O
kisses. O
He O
would O
pace O
a O
long O
time O
about O
his O
room, O
remembering O
it O
all O
and O
smiling; O
then O
his O
memories O
passed O
into O
dreams, O
and O
in O
his O
fancy O
the O
past O
was O
mingled O
with O
what O
was O
to O
come. O
Anna O
Sergeyevna O
did O
not O
visit O
him O
in O
dreams, O
but O
followed O
him O
about O
everywhere O
like O
a O
shadow O
and O
haunted O
him. O
When O
he O
shut O
his O
eyes O
he O
saw O
her O
as O
though O
she O
were O
living O
before O
him, O
and O
she O
seemed O
to O
him O
lovelier, O
younger, O
tenderer O
than O
she O
was; O
and O
he O
imagined O
himself O
finer O
than O
he O
had O
been O
in O
Yalta. O
In O
the O
evenings O
she O
peeped O
out O
at O
him O
from O
the O
bookcase, O
from O
the O
fireplace, O
from O
the O
corner-- O
he O
heard O
her O
breathing, O
the O
caressing O
rustle O
of O
her O
dress. O
In O
the O
street O
he O
watched O
the O
women, O
looking O
for O
some O
one O
like O
her. O
He O
was O
tormented O
by O
an O
intense O
desire O
to O
confide O
his O
memories O
to O
some O
one. O
But O
in O
his O
home O
it O
was O
impossible O
to O
talk O
of O
his O
love, O
and O
he O
had O
no O
one O
outside; O
he O
could O
not O
talk O
to O
his O
tenants O
nor O
to O
any O
one O
at O
the O
bank. O
And O
what O
had O
he O
to O
talk O
of? O
Had O
he O
been O
in O
love, O
then? O
Had O
there O
been O
anything O
beautiful, O
poetical, O
or O
edifying O
or O
simply O
interesting O
in O
his O
relations O
with O
Anna O
Sergeyevna? O
And O
there O
was O
nothing O
for O
him O
but O
to O
talk O
vaguely O
of O
love, O
of O
woman, O
and O
no O
one O
guessed O
what O
it O
meant; O
only O
his O
wife O
twitched O
her O
black O
eyebrows, O
and O
said: O
"The O
part O
of O
a O
lady-killer O
does O
not O
suit O
you O
at O
all, O
Dimitri." O
One O
evening, O
coming O
out O
of O
the O
doctors' O
club O
with O
an O
official O
with O
whom O
he O
had O
been O
playing O
cards, O
he O
could O
not O
resist O
saying: O
"If O
only O
you O
knew O
what O
a O
fascinating O
woman O
I O
made O
the O
acquaintance O
of O
in O
Yalta!" O
The O
official O
got O
into O
his O
sledge O
and O
was O
driving O
away, O
but O
turned O
suddenly O
and O
shouted: O
"Dmitri O
Dmitritch!" O
"What?" O
"You O
were O
right O
this O
evening: O
the O
sturgeon O
was O
a O
bit O
too O
strong!" O
These O
words, O
so O
ordinary, O
for O
some O
reason O
moved O
Gurov O
to O
indignation, O
and O
struck O
him O
as O
degrading O
and O
unclean. O
What O
savage O
manners, O
what O
people! O
What O
senseless O
nights, O
what O
uninteresting, O
uneventful O
days! O
The O
rage O
for O
card-playing, O
the O
gluttony, O
the O
drunkenness, O
the O
continual O
talk O
always O
about O
the O
same O
thing. O
Useless O
pursuits O
and O
conversations O
always O
about O
the O
same O
things O
absorb O
the O
better O
part O
of O
one's O
time, O
the O
better O
part O
of O
one's O
strength, O
and O
in O
the O
end O
there O
is O
left O
a O
life O
grovelling O
and O
curtailed, O
worthless O
and O
trivial, O
and O
there O
is O
no O
escaping O
or O
getting O
away O
from O
it-- O
just O
as O
though O
one O
were O
in O
a O
madhouse O
or O
a O
prison. O
Gurov O
did O
not O
sleep O
all O
night, O
and O
was O
filled O
with O
indignation. O
And O
he O
had O
a O
headache O
all O
next O
day. O
And O
the O
next O
night O
he O
slept O
badly; O
he O
sat O
up O
in O
bed, O
thinking, O
or O
paced O
up O
and O
down O
his O
room. O
He O
was O
sick O
of O
his O
children, O
sick O
of O
the O
bank; O
he O
had O
no O
desire O
to O
go O
anywhere O
or O
to O
talk O
of O
anything. O
In O
the O
holidays O
in O
December O
he O
prepared O
for O
a O
journey, O
and O
told O
his O
wife O
he O
was O
going O
to O
Petersburg O
to O
do O
something O
in O
the O
interests O
of O
a O
young O
friend-- O
and O
he O
set O
off O
for O
S--. O
What O
for? O
He O
did O
not O
very O
well O
know O
himself. O
He O
wanted O
to O
see O
Anna O
Sergeyevna O
and O
to O
talk O
with O
her-- O
to O
arrange O
a O
meeting, O
if O
possible. O
He O
reached O
S-- O
in O
the O
morning, O
and O
took O
the O
best O
room O
at O
the O
hotel, O
in O
which O
the O
floor O
was O
covered O
with O
grey O
army O
cloth, O
and O
on O
the O
table O
was O
an O
inkstand, O
grey O
with O
dust O
and O
adorned O
with O
a O
figure O
on O
horseback, O
with O
its O
hat O
in O
its O
hand O
and O
its O
head O
broken O
off. O
The O
hotel O
porter O
gave O
him O
the O
necessary O
information; O
Von O
Diderits O
lived O
in O
a O
house O
of O
his O
own O
in O
Old O
Gontcharny O
Street-- O
it O
was O
not O
far O
from O
the O
hotel: O
he O
was O
rich O
and O
lived O
in O
good O
style, O
and O
had O
his O
own O
horses; O
every O
one O
in O
the O
town O
knew O
him. O
The O
porter O
pronounced O
the O
name O
"Dridirits." O
Gurov O
went O
without O
haste O
to O
Old O
Gontcharny O
Street O
and O
found O
the O
house. O
Just O
opposite O
the O
house O
stretched O
a O
long O
grey O
fence O
adorned O
with O
nails. O
"One O
would O
run O
away O
from O
a O
fence O
like O
that," O
thought O
Gurov, O
looking O
from O
the O
fence O
to O
the O
windows O
of O
the O
house O
and O
back O
again. O
He O
considered: O
to-day O
was O
a O
holiday, O
and O
the O
husband O
would O
probably O
be O
at O
home. O
And O
in O
any O
case O
it O
would O
be O
tactless O
to O
go O
into O
the O
house O
and O
upset O
her. O
If O
he O
were O
to O
send O
her O
a O
note O
it O
might O
fall O
into O
her O
husband's O
hands, O
and O
then O
it O
might O
ruin O
everything. O
The O
best O
thing O
was O
to O
trust O
to O
chance. O
And O
he O
kept O
walking O
up O
and O
down O
the O
street O
by O
the O
fence, O
waiting O
for O
the O
chance. O
He O
saw O
a O
beggar O
go O
in O
at O
the O
gate O
and O
dogs O
fly O
at O
him; O
then O
an O
hour O
later O
he O
heard O
a O
piano, O
and O
the O
sounds O
were O
faint O
and O
indistinct. O
Probably O
it O
was O
Anna O
Sergeyevna O
playing. O
The O
front O
door O
suddenly O
opened, O
and O
an O
old O
woman O
came O
out, O
followed O
by O
the O
familiar O
white O
Pomeranian. O
Gurov O
was O
on O
the O
point O
of O
calling O
to O
the O
dog, O
but O
his O
heart O
began O
beating O
violently, O
and O
in O
his O
excitement O
he O
could O
not O
remember O
the O
dog's O
name. O
He O
walked O
up O
and O
down, O
and O
loathed O
the O
grey O
fence O
more O
and O
more, O
and O
by O
now O
he O
thought O
irritably O
that O
Anna O
Sergeyevna O
had O
forgotten O
him, O
and O
was O
perhaps O
already O
amusing O
herself O
with O
some O
one O
else, O
and O
that O
that O
was O
very O
natural O
in O
a O
young O
woman O
who O
had O
nothing O
to O
look O
at O
from O
morning O
till O
night O
but O
that O
confounded O
fence. O
He O
went O
back O
to O
his O
hotel O
room O
and O
sat O
for O
a O
long O
while O
on O
the O
sofa, O
not O
knowing O
what O
to O
do, O
then O
he O
had O
dinner O
and O
a O
long O
nap. O
"How O
stupid O
and O
worrying O
it O
is!" O
he O
thought O
when O
he O
woke O
and O
looked O
at O
the O
dark O
windows: O
it O
was O
already O
evening. O
"Here O
I've O
had O
a O
good O
sleep O
for O
some O
reason. O
What O
shall O
I O
do O
in O
the O
night?" O
He O
sat O
on O
the O
bed, O
which O
was O
covered O
by O
a O
cheap O
grey O
blanket, O
such O
as O
one O
sees O
in O
hospitals, O
and O
he O
taunted O
himself O
in O
his O
vexation: O
"So O
much O
for O
the O
lady O
with O
the O
dog. O
. O
. O
so O
much O
for O
the O
adventure O
. O
. O
. O
. O
You're O
in O
a O
nice O
fix. O
. O
. O
." O
That O
morning O
at O
the O
station O
a O
poster O
in O
large O
letters O
had O
caught O
his O
eye. O
"The O
Geisha" O
was O
to O
be O
performed O
for O
the O
first O
time. O
He O
thought O
of O
this O
and O
went O
to O
the O
theatre. O
"It's O
quite O
possible O
she O
may O
go O
to O
the O
first O
performance," O
he O
thought. O
The O
theatre O
was O
full. O
As O
in O
all O
provincial O
theatres, O
there O
was O
a O
fog O
above O
the O
chandelier, O
the O
gallery O
was O
noisy O
and O
restless; O
in O
the O
front O
row O
the O
local O
dandies O
were O
standing O
up O
before O
the O
beginning O
of O
the O
performance, O
with O
their O
hands O
behind O
them; O
in O
the O
Governor's O
box O
the O
Governor's O
daughter, O
wearing O
a O
boa, O
was O
sitting O
in O
the O
front O
seat, O
while O
the O
Governor O
himself O
lurked O
modestly O
behind O
the O
curtain O
with O
only O
his O
hands O
visible; O
the O
orchestra O
was O
a O
long O
time O
tuning O
up; O
the O
stage O
curtain O
swayed. O
All O
the O
time O
the O
audience O
were O
coming O
in O
and O
taking O
their O
seats O
Gurov O
looked O
at O
them O
eagerly. O
Anna O
Sergeyevna, O
too, O
came O
in. O
She O
sat O
down O
in O
the O
third O
row, O
and O
when O
Gurov O
looked O
at O
her O
his O
heart O
contracted, O
and O
he O
understood O
clearly O
that O
for O
him O
there O
was O
in O
the O
whole O
world O
no O
creature O
so O
near, O
so O
precious, O
and O
so O
important O
to O
him; O
she, O
this O
little O
woman, O
in O
no O
way O
remarkable, O
lost O
in O
a O
provincial O
crowd, O
with O
a O
vulgar O
lorgnette O
in O
her O
hand, O
filled O
his O
whole O
life O
now, O
was O
his O
sorrow O
and O
his O
joy, O
the O
one O
happiness O
that O
he O
now O
desired O
for O
himself, O
and O
to O
the O
sounds O
of O
the O
inferior O
orchestra, O
of O
the O
wretched O
provincial O
violins, O
he O
thought O
how O
lovely O
she O
was. O
He O
thought O
and O
dreamed. O
A O
young O
man O
with O
small O
side-whiskers, O
tall O
and O
stooping, O
came O
in O
with O
Anna O
Sergeyevna O
and O
sat O
down O
beside O
her; O
he O
bent O
his O
head O
at O
every O
step O
and O
seemed O
to O
be O
continually O
bowing. O
Most O
likely O
this O
was O
the O
husband O
whom O
at O
Yalta, O
in O
a O
rush O
of O
bitter O
feeling, O
she O
had O
called O
a O
flunkey. O
And O
there O
really O
was O
in O
his O
long O
figure, O
his O
side-whiskers, O
and O
the O
small O
bald O
patch O
on O
his O
head, O
something O
of O
the O
flunkey's O
obsequiousness; O
his O
smile O
was O
sugary, O
and O
in O
his O
buttonhole O
there O
was O
some O
badge O
of O
distinction O
like O
the O
number O
on O
a O
waiter. O
During O
the O
first O
interval O
the O
husband O
went O
away O
to O
smoke; O
she O
remained O
alone O
in O
her O
stall. O
Gurov, O
who O
was O
sitting O
in O
the O
stalls, O
too, O
went O
up O
to O
her O
and O
said O
in O
a O
trembling O
voice, O
with O
a O
forced O
smile: O
"Good-evening." O
She O
glanced O
at O
him O
and O
turned O
pale, O
then O
glanced O
again O
with O
horror, O
unable O
to O
believe O
her O
eyes, O
and O
tightly O
gripped O
the O
fan O
and O
the O
lorgnette O
in O
her O
hands, O
evidently O
struggling O
with O
herself O
not O
to O
faint. O
Both O
were O
silent. O
She O
was O
sitting, O
he O
was O
standing, O
frightened O
by O
her O
confusion O
and O
not O
venturing O
to O
sit O
down O
beside O
her. O
The O
violins O
and O
the O
flute O
began O
tuning O
up. O
He O
felt O
suddenly O
frightened; O
it O
seemed O
as O
though O
all O
the O
people O
in O
the O
boxes O
were O
looking O
at O
them. O
She O
got O
up O
and O
went O
quickly O
to O
the O
door; O
he O
followed O
her, O
and O
both O
walked O
senselessly O
along O
passages, O
and O
up O
and O
down O
stairs, O
and O
figures O
in O
legal, O
scholastic, O
and O
civil O
service O
uniforms, O
all O
wearing O
badges, O
flitted O
before O
their O
eyes. O
They O
caught O
glimpses O
of O
ladies, O
of O
fur O
coats O
hanging O
on O
pegs; O
the O
draughts O
blew O
on O
them, O
bringing O
a O
smell O
of O
stale O
tobacco. O
And O
Gurov, O
whose O
heart O
was O
beating O
violently, O
thought: O
"Oh, O
heavens! O
Why O
are O
these O
people O
here O
and O
this O
orchestra! O
. O
. O
." O
And O
at O
that O
instant O
he O
recalled O
how O
when O
he O
had O
seen O
Anna O
Sergeyevna O
off O
at O
the O
station O
he O
had O
thought O
that O
everything O
was O
over O
and O
they O
would O
never O
meet O
again. O
But O
how O
far O
they O
were O
still O
from O
the O
end! O
On O
the O
narrow, O
gloomy O
staircase O
over O
which O
was O
written O
"To O
the O
Amphitheatre," O
she O
stopped. O
"How O
you O
have O
frightened O
me!" O
she O
said, O
breathing O
hard, O
still O
pale O
and O
overwhelmed. O
"Oh, O
how O
you O
have O
frightened O
me! O
I O
am O
half O
dead. O
Why O
have O
you O
come? O
Why?" O
"But O
do O
understand, O
Anna, O
do O
understand O
. O
. O
." O
he O
said O
hastily O
in O
a O
low O
voice. O
"I O
entreat O
you O
to O
understand. O
. O
. O
." O
She O
looked O
at O
him O
with O
dread, O
with O
entreaty, O
with O
love; O
she O
looked O
at O
him O
intently, O
to O
keep O
his O
features O
more O
distinctly O
in O
her O
memory. O
"I O
am O
so O
unhappy," O
she O
went O
on, O
not O
heeding O
him. O
"I O
have O
thought O
of O
nothing O
but O
you O
all O
the O
time; O
I O
live O
only O
in O
the O
thought O
of O
you. O
And O
I O
wanted O
to O
forget, O
to O
forget O
you; O
but O
why, O
oh, O
why, O
have O
you O
come?" O
On O
the O
landing O
above O
them O
two O
schoolboys O
were O
smoking O
and O
looking O
down, O
but O
that O
was O
nothing O
to O
Gurov; O
he O
drew O
Anna O
Sergeyevna O
to O
him, O
and O
began O
kissing O
her O
face, O
her O
cheeks, O
and O
her O
hands. O
"What O
are O
you O
doing, O
what O
are O
you O
doing!" O
she O
cried O
in O
horror, O
pushing O
him O
away. O
"We O
are O
mad. O
Go O
away O
to-day; O
go O
away O
at O
once. O
. O
. O
. O
I O
beseech O
you O
by O
all O
that O
is O
sacred, O
I O
implore O
you. O
. O
. O
. O
There O
are O
people O
coming O
this O
way!" O
Some O
one O
was O
coming O
up O
the O
stairs. O
"You O
must O
go O
away," O
Anna O
Sergeyevna O
went O
on O
in O
a O
whisper. O
"Do O
you O
hear, O
Dmitri O
Dmitritch? O
I O
will O
come O
and O
see O
you O
in O
Moscow. O
I O
have O
never O
been O
happy; O
I O
am O
miserable O
now, O
and O
I O
never, O
never O
shall O
be O
happy, O
never! O
Don't O
make O
me O
suffer O
still O
more! O
I O
swear O
I'll O
come O
to O
Moscow. O
But O
now O
let O
us O
part. O
My O
precious, O
good, O
dear O
one, O
we O
must O
part!" O
She O
pressed O
his O
hand O
and O
began O
rapidly O
going O
downstairs, O
looking O
round O
at O
him, O
and O
from O
her O
eyes O
he O
could O
see O
that O
she O
really O
was O
unhappy. O
Gurov O
stood O
for O
a O
little O
while, O
listened, O
then, O
when O
all O
sound O
had O
died O
away, O
he O
found O
his O
coat O
and O
left O
the O
theatre. O
IV O
And O
Anna O
Sergeyevna O
began O
coming O
to O
see O
him O
in O
Moscow. O
Once O
in O
two O
or O
three O
months O
she O
left O
S--, O
telling O
her O
husband O
that O
she O
was O
going O
to O
consult O
a O
doctor O
about O
an O
internal O
complaint-- O
and O
her O
husband O
believed O
her, O
and O
did O
not O
believe O
her. O
In O
Moscow O
she O
stayed O
at O
the O
Slaviansky O
Bazaar O
hotel, O
and O
at O
once O
sent O
a O
man O
in O
a O
red O
cap O
to O
Gurov. O
Gurov O
went O
to O
see O
her, O
and O
no O
one O
in O
Moscow O
knew O
of O
it. O
Once O
he O
was O
going O
to O
see O
her O
in O
this O
way O
on O
a O
winter O
morning O
(the O
messenger O
had O
come O
the O
evening O
before O
when O
he O
was O
out). O
With O
him O
walked O
his O
daughter, O
whom O
he O
wanted O
to O
take O
to O
school: O
it O
was O
on O
the O
way. O
Snow O
was O
falling O
in O
big O
wet O
flakes. O
"It's O
three O
degrees O
above O
freezing-point, O
and O
yet O
it O
is O
snowing," O
said O
Gurov O
to O
his O
daughter. O
"The O
thaw O
is O
only O
on O
the O
surface O
of O
the O
earth; O
there O
is O
quite O
a O
different O
temperature O
at O
a O
greater O
height O
in O
the O
atmosphere." O
"And O
why O
are O
there O
no O
thunderstorms O
in O
the O
winter, O
father?" O
He O
explained O
that, O
too. O
He O
talked, O
thinking O
all O
the O
while O
that O
he O
was O
going O
to O
see O
her, O
and O
no O
living O
soul O
knew O
of O
it, O
and O
probably O
never O
would O
know. O
He O
had O
two O
lives: O
one, O
open, O
seen O
and O
known O
by O
all O
who O
cared O
to O
know, O
full O
of O
relative O
truth O
and O
of O
relative O
falsehood, O
exactly O
like O
the O
lives O
of O
his O
friends O
and O
acquaintances; O
and O
another O
life O
running O
its O
course O
in O
secret. O
And O
through O
some O
strange, O
perhaps O
accidental, O
conjunction O
of O
circumstances, O
everything O
that O
was O
essential, O
of O
interest O
and O
of O
value O
to O
him, O
everything O
in O
which O
he O
was O
sincere O
and O
did O
not O
deceive O
himself, O
everything O
that O
made O
the O
kernel O
of O
his O
life, O
was O
hidden O
from O
other O
people; O
and O
all O
that O
was O
false O
in O
him, O
the O
sheath O
in O
which O
he O
hid O
himself O
to O
conceal O
the O
truth-- O
such, O
for O
instance, O
as O
his O
work O
in O
the O
bank, O
his O
discussions O
at O
the O
club, O
his O
"lower O
race," O
his O
presence O
with O
his O
wife O
at O
anniversary O
festivities-- O
all O
that O
was O
open. O
And O
he O
judged O
of O
others O
by O
himself, O
not O
believing O
in O
what O
he O
saw, O
and O
always O
believing O
that O
every O
man O
had O
his O
real, O
most O
interesting O
life O
under O
the O
cover O
of O
secrecy O
and O
under O
the O
cover O
of O
night. O
All O
personal O
life O
rested O
on O
secrecy, O
and O
possibly O
it O
was O
partly O
on O
that O
account O
that O
civilised O
man O
was O
so O
nervously O
anxious O
that O
personal O
privacy O
should O
be O
respected. O
After O
leaving O
his O
daughter O
at O
school, O
Gurov O
went O
on O
to O
the O
Slaviansky O
Bazaar. O
He O
took O
off O
his O
fur O
coat O
below, O
went O
upstairs, O
and O
softly O
knocked O
at O
the O
door. O
Anna O
Sergeyevna, O
wearing O
his O
favourite O
grey O
dress, O
exhausted O
by O
the O
journey O
and O
the O
suspense, O
had O
been O
expecting O
him O
since O
the O
evening O
before. O
She O
was O
pale; O
she O
looked O
at O
him, O
and O
did O
not O
smile, O
and O
he O
had O
hardly O
come O
in O
when O
she O
fell O
on O
his O
breast. O
Their O
kiss O
was O
slow O
and O
prolonged, O
as O
though O
they O
had O
not O
met O
for O
two O
years. O
"Well, O
how O
are O
you O
getting O
on O
there?" O
he O
asked. O
"What O
news?" O
"Wait; O
I'll O
tell O
you O
directly. O
. O
. O
. O
I O
can't O
talk." O
She O
could O
not O
speak; O
she O
was O
crying. O
She O
turned O
away O
from O
him, O
and O
pressed O
her O
handkerchief O
to O
her O
eyes. O
"Let O
her O
have O
her O
cry O
out. O
I'll O
sit O
down O
and O
wait," O
he O
thought, O
and O
he O
sat O
down O
in O
an O
arm-chair. O
Then O
he O
rang O
and O
asked O
for O
tea O
to O
be O
brought O
him, O
and O
while O
he O
drank O
his O
tea O
she O
remained O
standing O
at O
the O
window O
with O
her O
back O
to O
him. O
She O
was O
crying O
from O
emotion, O
from O
the O
miserable O
consciousness O
that O
their O
life O
was O
so O
hard O
for O
them; O
they O
could O
only O
meet O
in O
secret, O
hiding O
themselves O
from O
people, O
like O
thieves! O
Was O
not O
their O
life O
shattered? O
"Come, O
do O
stop!" O
he O
said. O
It O
was O
evident O
to O
him O
that O
this O
love O
of O
theirs O
would O
not O
soon O
be O
over, O
that O
he O
could O
not O
see O
the O
end O
of O
it. O
Anna O
Sergeyevna O
grew O
more O
and O
more O
attached O
to O
him. O
She O
adored O
him, O
and O
it O
was O
unthinkable O
to O
say O
to O
her O
that O
it O
was O
bound O
to O
have O
an O
end O
some O
day; O
besides, O
she O
would O
not O
have O
believed O
it! O
He O
went O
up O
to O
her O
and O
took O
her O
by O
the O
shoulders O
to O
say O
something O
affectionate O
and O
cheering, O
and O
at O
that O
moment O
he O
saw O
himself O
in O
the O
looking-glass. O
His O
hair O
was O
already O
beginning O
to O
turn O
grey. O
And O
it O
seemed O
strange O
to O
him O
that O
he O
had O
grown O
so O
much O
older, O
so O
much O
plainer O
during O
the O
last O
few O
years. O
The O
shoulders O
on O
which O
his O
hands O
rested O
were O
warm O
and O
quivering. O
He O
felt O
compassion O
for O
this O
life, O
still O
so O
warm O
and O
lovely, O
but O
probably O
already O
not O
far O
from O
beginning O
to O
fade O
and O
wither O
like O
his O
own. O
Why O
did O
she O
love O
him O
so O
much? O
He O
always O
seemed O
to O
women O
different O
from O
what O
he O
was, O
and O
they O
loved O
in O
him O
not O
himself, O
but O
the O
man O
created O
by O
their O
imagination, O
whom O
they O
had O
been O
eagerly O
seeking O
all O
their O
lives; O
and O
afterwards, O
when O
they O
noticed O
their O
mistake, O
they O
loved O
him O
all O
the O
same. O
And O
not O
one O
of O
them O
had O
been O
happy O
with O
him. O
Time O
passed, O
he O
had O
made O
their O
acquaintance, O
got O
on O
with O
them, O
parted, O
but O
he O
had O
never O
once O
loved; O
it O
was O
anything O
you O
like, O
but O
not O
love. O
And O
only O
now O
when O
his O
head O
was O
grey O
he O
had O
fallen O
properly, O
really O
in O
love-- O
for O
the O
first O
time O
in O
his O
life. O
Anna O
Sergeyevna O
and O
he O
loved O
each O
other O
like O
people O
very O
close O
and O
akin, O
like O
husband O
and O
wife, O
like O
tender O
friends; O
it O
seemed O
to O
them O
that O
fate O
itself O
had O
meant O
them O
for O
one O
another, O
and O
they O
could O
not O
understand O
why O
he O
had O
a O
wife O
and O
she O
a O
husband; O
and O
it O
was O
as O
though O
they O
were O
a O
pair O
of O
birds O
of O
passage, O
caught O
and O
forced O
to O
live O
in O
different O
cages. O
They O
forgave O
each O
other O
for O
what O
they O
were O
ashamed O
of O
in O
their O
past, O
they O
forgave O
everything O
in O
the O
present, O
and O
felt O
that O
this O
love O
of O
theirs O
had O
changed O
them O
both. O
In O
moments O
of O
depression O
in O
the O
past O
he O
had O
comforted O
himself O
with O
any O
arguments O
that O
came O
into O
his O
mind, O
but O
now O
he O
no O
longer O
cared O
for O
arguments; O
he O
felt O
profound O
compassion, O
he O
wanted O
to O
be O
sincere O
and O
tender. O
. O
. O
. O
"Don't O
cry, O
my O
darling," O
he O
said. O
"You've O
had O
your O
cry; O
that's O
enough. O
. O
. O
. O
Let O
us O
talk O
now, O
let O
us O
think O
of O
some O
plan." O
Then O
they O
spent O
a O
long O
while O
taking O
counsel O
together, O
talked O
of O
how O
to O
avoid O
the O
necessity O
for O
secrecy, O
for O
deception, O
for O
living O
in O
different O
towns O
and O
not O
seeing O
each O
other O
for O
long O
at O
a O
time. O
How O
could O
they O
be O
free O
from O
this O
intolerable O
bondage? O
"How? O
How?" O
he O
asked, O
clutching O
his O
head. O
"How?" O
And O
it O
seemed O
as O
though O
in O
a O
little O
while O
the O
solution O
would O
be O
found, O
and O
then O
a O
new O
and O
splendid O
life O
would O
begin; O
and O
it O
was O
clear O
to O
both O
of O
them O
that O
they O
had O
still O
a O
long, O
long O
road O
before O
them, O
and O
that O
the O
most O
complicated O
and O
difficult O
part O
of O
it O
was O
only O
just O
beginning. O

THE O

MONK O
I O
ANDREY O
VASSILITCH O
KOVRIN, O
who O
held O
a O
master's O
degree O
at O
the O
University, O
had O
exhausted O
himself, O
and O
had O
upset O
his O
nerves. O
He O
did O
not O
send O
for O
a O
doctor, O
but O
casually, O
over O
a O
bottle O
of O
wine, O
he O
spoke O
to O

Very O
opportunely O
a O
long O
letter O
came O
from O
Tanya O
Pesotsky, O
who O
asked O
him O
to O
come O
and O
stay O
with O
them O
at O
Borissovka. O
And O
he O
made O
up O
his O
mind O
that O
he O
really O
must O
go. O
To O
begin O
with-- O
that O
was O
in O
April-- O
he O
went O
to O
his O
own O
home, O
Kovrinka, O
and O
there O
spent O
three O
weeks O
in O
solitude; O
then, O
as O
soon O
as O
the O
roads O
were O
in O
good O
condition, O
he O
set O
off, O
driving O
in O
a O
carriage, O
to O
visit O
Pesotsky, O
his O
former O
guardian, O
who O
had O
brought O
him O
up, O
and O
was O
a O
horticulturist O
well O
known O
all O
over O
Russia. O
The O
distance O
from O
Kovrinka O
to O
Borissovka O
was O
reckoned O
only O
a O
little O
over O
fifty O
miles. O
To O
drive O
along O
a O
soft O
road O
in O
May O
in O
a O
comfortable O
carriage O
with O
springs O
was O
a O
real O
pleasure. O
Pesotsky O
had O
an O
immense O
house O
with O
columns O
and O
lions, O
off O
which O
the O
stucco O
was O
peeling, O
and O
with O
a O
footman O
in O
swallow-tails O
at O
the O
entrance. O
The O
old O
park, O
laid O
out O
in O
the O
English O
style, O
gloomy O
and O
severe, O
stretched O
for O
almost O
three-quarters O
of O
a O
mile O
to O
the O
river, O
and O
there O
ended O
in O
a O
steep, O
precipitous O
clay O
bank, O
where O
pines O
grew O
with O
bare O
roots O
that O
looked O
like O
shaggy O
paws; O
the O
water O
shone O
below O
with O
an O
unfriendly O
gleam, O
and O
the O
peewits O
flew O
up O
with O
a O
plaintive O
cry, O
and O
there O
one O
always O
felt O
that O
one O
must O
sit O
down O
and O
write O
a O
ballad. O
But O
near O
the O
house O
itself, O
in O
the O
courtyard O
and O
orchard, O
which O
together O
with O
the O
nurseries O
covered O
ninety O
acres, O
it O
was O
all O
life O
and O
gaiety O
even O
in O
bad O
weather. O
Such O
marvellous O
roses, O
lilies, O
camellias; O
such O
tulips O
of O
all O
possible O
shades, O
from O
glistening O
white O
to O
sooty O
black-- O
such O
a O
wealth O
of O
flowers, O
in O
fact, O
Kovrin O
had O
never O
seen O
anywhere O
as O
at O
Pesotsky's. O
It O
was O
only O
the O
beginning O
of O
spring, O
and O
the O
real O
glory O
of O
the O
flower-beds O
was O
still O
hidden O
away O
in O
the O
hot-houses. O
But O
even O
the O
flowers O
along O
the O
avenues, O
and O
here O
and O
there O
in O
the O
flower-beds, O
were O
enough O
to O
make O
one O
feel, O
as O
one O
walked O
about O
the O
garden, O
as O
though O
one O
were O
in O
a O
realm O
of O
tender O
colours, O
especially O
in O
the O
early O
morning O
when O
the O
dew O
was O
glistening O
on O
every O
petal. O
What O
was O
the O
decorative O
part O
of O
the O
garden, O
and O
what O
Pesotsky O
contemptuously O
spoke O
of O
as O
rubbish, O
had O
at O
one O
time O
in O
his O
childhood O
given O
Kovrin O
an O
impression O
of O
fairyland. O
Every O
sort O
of O
caprice, O
of O
elaborate O
monstrosity O
and O
mockery O
at O
Nature O
was O
here. O
There O
were O
espaliers O
of O
fruit-trees, O
a O
pear-tree O
in O
the O
shape O
of O
a O
pyramidal O
poplar, O
spherical O
oaks O
and O
lime-trees, O
an O
apple-tree O
in O
the O
shape O
of O
an O
umbrella, O
plum-trees O
trained O
into O
arches, O
crests, O
candelabra, O
and O
even O
into O
the O
number O
1862-- O
the O
year O
when O
Pesotsky O
first O
took O
up O
horticulture. O
One O
came O
across, O
too, O
lovely, O
graceful O
trees O
with O
strong, O
straight O
stems O
like O
palms, O
and O
it O
was O
only O
by O
looking O
intently O
that O
one O
could O
recognise O
these O
trees O
as O
gooseberries O
or O
currants. O
But O
what O
made O
the O
garden O
most O
cheerful O
and O
gave O
it O
a O
lively O
air, O
was O
the O
continual O
coming O
and O
going O
in O
it, O
from O
early O
morning O
till O
evening; O
people O
with O
wheelbarrows, O
shovels, O
and O
watering-cans O
swarmed O
round O
the O
trees O
and O
bushes, O
in O
the O
avenues O
and O
the O
flower-beds, O
like O
ants. O
. O
. O
. O
Kovrin O
arrived O
at O
Pesotsky's O
at O
ten O
o'clock O
in O
the O
evening. O
He O
found O
Tanya O
and O
her O
father, O
Yegor O
Semyonitch, O
in O
great O
anxiety. O
The O
clear O
starlight O
sky O
and O
the O
thermometer O
foretold O
a O
frost O
towards O
morning, O
and O
meanwhile O
Ivan O
Karlovitch, O
the O
gardener, O
had O
gone O
to O
the O
town, O
and O
they O
had O
no O
one O
to O
rely O
upon. O
At O
supper O
they O
talked O
of O
nothing O
but O
the O
morning O
frost, O
and O
it O
was O
settled O
that O
Tanya O
should O
not O
go O
to O
bed, O
and O
between O
twelve O
and O
one O
should O
walk O
through O
the O
garden, O
and O
see O
that O
everything O
was O
done O
properly, O
and O
Yegor O
Semyonitch O
should O
get O
up O
at O
three O
o'clock O
or O
even O
earlier. O
Kovrin O
sat O
with O
Tanya O
all O
the O
evening, O
and O
after O
midnight O
went O
out O
with O
her O
into O
the O
garden. O
It O
was O
cold. O
There O
was O
a O
strong O
smell O
of O
burning O
already O
in O
the O
garden. O
In O
the O
big O
orchard, O
which O
was O
called O
the O
commercial O
garden, O
and O
which O
brought O
Yegor O
Semyonitch O
several O
thousand O
clear O
profit, O
a O
thick, O
black, O
acrid O
smoke O
was O
creeping O
over O
the O
ground O
and, O
curling O
around O
the O
trees, O
was O
saving O
those O
thousands O
from O
the O
frost. O
Here O
the O
trees O
were O
arranged O
as O
on O
a O
chessboard, O
in O
straight O
and O
regular O
rows O
like O
ranks O
of O
soldiers, O
and O
this O
severe O
pedantic O
regularity, O
and O
the O
fact O
that O
all O
the O
trees O
were O
of O
the O
same O
size, O
and O
had O
tops O
and O
trunks O
all O
exactly O
alike, O
made O
them O
look O
monotonous O
and O
even O
dreary. O
Kovrin O
and O
Tanya O
walked O
along O
the O
rows O
where O
fires O
of O
dung, O
straw, O
and O
all O
sorts O
of O
refuse O
were O
smouldering, O
and O
from O
time O
to O
time O
they O
were O
met O
by O
labourers O
who O
wandered O
in O
the O
smoke O
like O
shadows. O
The O
only O
trees O
in O
flower O
were O
the O
cherries, O
plums, O
and O
certain O
sorts O
of O
apples, O
but O
the O
whole O
garden O
was O
plunged O
in O
smoke, O
and O
it O
was O
only O
near O
the O
nurseries O
that O
Kovrin O
could O
breathe O
freely. O
"Even Quotation
as Quotation
a Quotation
child Quotation
I Quotation
used Quotation
to Quotation
sneeze Quotation
from Quotation
the Quotation
smoke Quotation
here," Quotation
he Entity
said, Cue
shrugging O
his O
shoulders, O
"but Quotation
to Quotation
this Quotation
day Quotation
I Quotation
don't Quotation
understand Quotation
how Quotation
smoke Quotation
can Quotation
keep Quotation
off Quotation
frost." Quotation
"Smoke Quotation
takes Quotation
the Quotation
place Quotation
of Quotation
clouds Quotation
when Quotation
there Quotation
are Quotation
none Quotation
. Quotation
. Quotation
." Quotation
answered Cue
Tanya. Entity
"And Quotation
what Quotation
do Quotation
you Quotation
want Quotation
clouds Quotation
for?" Quotation
"In Quotation
overcast Quotation
and Quotation
cloudy Quotation
weather Quotation
there Quotation
is Quotation
no Quotation
frost." Quotation
"You Quotation
don't Quotation
say Quotation
so." Quotation
He O
laughed O
and O
took O
her O
arm. O
Her O
broad, O
very O
earnest O
face, O
chilled O
with O
the O
frost, O
with O
her O
delicate O
black O
eyebrows, O
the O
turned-up O
collar O
of O
her O
coat, O
which O
prevented O
her O
moving O
her O
head O
freely, O
and O
the O
whole O
of O
her O
thin, O
graceful O
figure, O
with O
her Entity
skirts O
tucked O
up O
on O
account O
of O
the O
dew, O
touched O
him. O
"Good Quotation
heavens! Quotation
she Quotation
is Quotation
grown Quotation
up," Quotation
he Entity
said. Cue
"When Quotation
I Quotation
went Quotation
away Quotation
from Quotation
here Quotation
last, Quotation
five Quotation
years Quotation
ago, Quotation
you Quotation
were Quotation
still Quotation
a Quotation
child. Quotation
You Quotation
were Quotation
such Quotation
a Quotation
thin, Quotation
longlegged Quotation
creature, Quotation
with Quotation
your Quotation
hair Quotation
hanging Quotation
on Quotation
your Quotation
shoulders; Quotation
you Quotation
used Quotation
to Quotation
wear Quotation
short Quotation
frocks, Quotation

I Quotation

tease Quotation
you, Quotation

What Quotation

"Yes, Quotation
five Quotation

sighed Cue
Tanya. Entity
"Much Quotation

Tell Quotation
me, Quotation
Andryusha, Quotation

eagerly, O
looking O
him Entity
in O
the O
face: O
"do Quotation
you Quotation

strange Quotation

us Quotation

why Quotation

you? Quotation
You Quotation

so Quotation
natural! Quotation
But Quotation
however Quotation
that Quotation

Andryusha, Quotation
I Quotation
want Quotation
you Quotation

us Quotation

We Quotation
have Quotation
a Quotation
right Quotation

"I Quotation
do, Quotation
Tanya." Quotation
"On Quotation
your Quotation
word Quotation
of Quotation
honour?" Quotation
"Yes, Quotation
on Quotation
my Quotation
word Quotation
of Quotation
honour." Quotation
"You Quotation
were Quotation
surprised Quotation
this Quotation
evening Quotation
that Quotation
we Quotation
have Quotation
so Quotation
many Quotation
of Quotation
your Quotation

You Quotation
know Quotation
my Quotation
father Quotation
adores Quotation
you. Quotation
Sometimes Quotation
it Quotation
seems Quotation
to Quotation
me Quotation
that Quotation
he Quotation
loves Quotation
you Quotation
more Quotation

he Quotation
does Quotation
me. Quotation
He Quotation

proud Quotation

You Quotation

a Quotation
clever, Quotation

a Quotation
brilliant Quotation

you Quotation

up. Quotation
I Quotation
don't Quotation
try Quotation
to Quotation
prevent Quotation
him Quotation
from Quotation
thinking Quotation
so. Quotation
Let Quotation
him." Quotation
Dawn O
was O
already O
beginning, O
and O
that O
was O
especially O
perceptible O
from O
the O
distinctness O
with O
which O
the O
coils O
of O
smoke O
and O
the O
tops O
of O
the O

began O
to O
stand O
out O
in O
the O
air. O
"It's Quotation
time Quotation
we Quotation
were Quotation
asleep, Quotation
though," Quotation
said Cue
Tanya, Entity
"and Quotation
it's Quotation
cold, Quotation
too." Quotation
She O
took O
his Entity
arm. O
"Thank Quotation
you Quotation
for Quotation
coming, Quotation
Andryusha. Quotation
We Quotation
have Quotation
only Quotation
uninteresting Quotation

We Quotation
have Quotation
only Quotation
the Quotation

the Quotation

nothing Quotation

Standards, Quotation

All, Quotation
all Quotation
our Quotation

into Quotation

I Quotation
never Quotation
even Quotation
dream Quotation

anything Quotation

apples Quotation

useful, Quotation

sometimes Quotation

to Quotation
us Quotation

the Quotation
summer Quotation

simply Quotation
a Quotation

always Quotation

fresher Quotation

the Quotation

as Quotation
though Quotation
the Quotation

had Quotation
been Quotation
taken Quotation
off Quotation
the Quotation

the Quotation
furniture. Quotation
I Quotation
was Quotation
only Quotation
a Quotation
little Quotation
girl Quotation
then, Quotation
but Quotation
yet Quotation
I Quotation
understood Quotation
it." Quotation
She O
talked O
a O
long O
while O
and O
with O
great O
feeling. O
For O
some O
reason O
the O
idea O
came O
into O
his O
head O
that O
in O
the O
course O
of O
the O
summer O
he O
might O
grow O
fond O
of O
this O
little, O
weak, O
talkative O

might O
be O
carried O
away O
and O
fall O
in O
love; O
in O
their O
position O
it O
was O
so O
possible O
and O
natural! O
This O
thought O
touched O
and O
amused O
him; O
he Entity
bent O
down O
to O
her Entity
sweet, O
preoccupied O
face O

hummed Cue
softly: O

By O

up. O
Kovrin O

not O

he O
talked O
to O
the O
old O

went O
to O
the O

with O
him. O
Yegor O
Semyonitch O
was O
a O
tall, O
broad-shouldered, O
corpulent O

he O
suffered O
from O

yet O
he O
walked O
so O
fast O
that O
it O
was O
hard O
work O
to O

after O
him. O
He O
had O
an O
extremely O
preoccupied O

he O
was O
always O

somewhere, O
with O

"Here Quotation

breath. O
"On Quotation

"I Quotation

But O
suddenly O

"Who Quotation

When O
he O
came O
back O
to O
Kovrin, Entity
his O
face O
looked O
exhausted O
and O
mortified. O
"What Quotation
is Quotation
one Quotation
to Quotation
do Quotation
with Quotation
these Quotation
accursed Quotation
people?" Quotation
he Entity
said Cue
in O
a O
tearful O
voice, O
flinging O
up O
his O

"Styopka Quotation
was Quotation
carting Quotation
dung Quotation
at Quotation
night, Quotation

He Quotation
twisted Quotation
the Quotation

round Quotation
it, Quotation
the Quotation

as Quotation
tightly Quotation
as Quotation

could, Quotation
so Quotation
that Quotation

off Quotation

What Quotation
do Quotation
you Quotation
think Quotation
of Quotation
that! Quotation
I Quotation
spoke Quotation
to Quotation
him Quotation

he Quotation
stands Quotation
like Quotation
a Quotation
post Quotation
and Quotation
only Quotation
blinks Quotation
his Quotation
eyes. Quotation
Hanging Quotation

too Quotation
good Quotation

Growing O
calmer, O
he O
embraced O
Kovrin Entity
and O
kissed O
him O
on O
the O
cheek. O
"Well, Quotation

Unutterably Quotation

you." Quotation
Then, O
with O
the O
same O
rapid O
step O
and O
preoccupied O
face, O
he O
made O
the O
round O
of O
the O
whole O
garden, O
and O
showed O
his O
former O
ward O
all O
his O
greenhouses O
and O
hot-houses, O
his O
covered-in O
garden, O
and O
two O
apiaries O
which O
he O
called O
the O
marvel O
of O
our O
century. O
While O
they O
were O
walking O
the O
sun O
rose, O
flooding O
the O
garden O
with O
brilliant O
light. O
It O
grew O
warm. O
Foreseeing O
a O
long, O
bright, O
cheerful O
day, O
Kovrin O
recollected O
that O
it O
was O
only O
the O
beginning O
of O
May, O
and O
that O
he O
had O
before O
him O
a O
whole O
summer O
as O
bright, O
cheerful, O
and O
long; O
and O
suddenly O
there O
stirred O
in O
his O
bosom O
a O
joyous, O
youthful O
feeling, O
such O
as O
he O
used O
to O
experience O
in O
his O
childhood, O
running O
about O
in O
that O
garden. O
And O
he O
hugged O
the O
old O
man O
and O
kissed O
him O
affectionately. O
Both O
of O
them, O
feeling O
touched, O
went O
indoors O
and O
drank O
tea O
out O
of O
old-fashioned O
china O
cups, O
with O
cream O
and O
satisfying O
krendels O
made O
with O
milk O
and O
eggs; O
and O
these O
trifles O
reminded O
Kovrin O
again O
of O
his O
childhood O
and O
boyhood. O
The O
delightful O
present O
was O
blended O
with O
the O
impressions O
of O
the O
past O
that O
stirred O
within O
him; O
there O
was O
a O
tightness O
at O
his O
heart; O
yet O
he O
was O
happy. O
He O
waited O
till O
Tanya O
was O
awake O
and O
had O
coffee O
with O
her, O
went O
for O
a O
walk, O
then O
went O
to O
his O
room O
and O
sat O
down O
to O
work. O
He O
read O
attentively, O
making O
notes, O
and O
from O
time O
to O
time O
raised O
his O
eyes O
to O
look O
out O
at O
the O
open O
windows O
or O
at O
the O
fresh, O
still O
dewy O
flowers O
in O
the O
vases O
on O
the O
table; O
and O
again O
he O
dropped O
his O
eyes O
to O
his O
book, O
and O
it O
seemed O
to O
him O
as O
though O
every O
vein O
in O
his O
body O
was O
quivering O
and O
fluttering O
with O
pleasure. O
II O
In O
the O
country O
he O
led O
just O
as O
nervous O
and O
restless O
a O
life O
as O
in O
town. O
He O
read O
and O
wrote O
a O
great O
deal, O
he O
studied O
Italian, O
and O
when O
he O
was O
out O
for O
a O
walk, O
thought O
with O
pleasure O
that O
he O
would O
soon O
sit O
down O
to O
work O
again. O
He O
slept O
so O
little O
that O
every O
one O
wondered O
at O
him; O
if O
he O
accidentally O
dozed O
for O
half O
an O
hour O
in O
the O
daytime, O
he O
would O
lie O
awake O
all O
night, O
and, O
after O
a O
sleepless O
night, O
would O
feel O
cheerful O
and O
vigorous O
as O
though O
nothing O
had O
happened. O
He O
talked O
a O
great O
deal, O
drank O
wine, O
and O
smoked O
expensive O
cigars. O
Very O
often, O
almost O
every O
day, O
young O
ladies O
of O
neighbouring O
families O
would O
come O
to O
the O
Pesotskys', O
and O
would O
sing O
and O
play O
the O
piano O
with O
Tanya; O
sometimes O
a O
young O
neighbour O
who O
was O
a O
good O
violinist O
would O
come, O
too. O
Kovrin O
listened O
with O
eagerness O
to O
the O
music O
and O
singing, O
and O
was O
exhausted O
by O
it, O
and O
this O
showed O
itself O
by O
his O
eyes O
closing O
and O
his O
head O
falling O
to O
one O
side. O
One O
day O
he O
was O
sitting O
on O
the O
balcony O
after O
evening O
tea, O
reading. O
At O
the O
same O
time, O
in O
the O
drawing-room, O
Tanya O
taking O
soprano, O
one O
of O
the O
young O
ladies O
a O
contralto, O
and O
the O
young O
man O
with O
his O
violin, O
were O
practising O
a O
well-known O
serenade O
of O
Braga's. O
Kovrin O
listened O
to O
the O
words-- O
they O
were O
Russian-- O
and O
could O
not O
understand O
their O
meaning. O
At O
last, O
leaving O
his O
book O
and O
listening O
attentively, O
he O
understood: O
a O
maiden, O
full O
of O
sick O
fancies, O
heard O
one O
night O
in O
her O
garden O
mysterious O
sounds, O
so O
strange O
and O
lovely O
that O
she O
was O
obliged O
to O
recognise O
them O
as O
a O
holy O
harmony O
which O
is O
unintelligible O
to O
us O
mortals, O
and O
so O
flies O
back O
to O
heaven. O
Kovrin's O
eyes O
began O
to O
close. O
He O
got O
up, O
and O
in O
exhaustion O
walked O
up O
and O
down O
the O
drawing-room, O
and O
then O
the O
dining-room. O
When O
the O
singing O
was O
over O
he O
took O
Tanya's Entity
arm, O
and O
with O
her O
went O
out O
on O
the O
balcony. O
"I Quotation
have Quotation
been Quotation
all Quotation
day Quotation
thinking Quotation
of Quotation
a Quotation
legend," Quotation
he Entity
said. Cue
"I Quotation
don't Quotation
remember Quotation
whether Quotation
I Quotation
have Quotation
read Quotation
it Quotation
somewhere Quotation
or Quotation
heard Quotation
it, Quotation
but Quotation
it Quotation
is Quotation
a Quotation
strange Quotation
and Quotation
almost Quotation
grotesque Quotation
legend. Quotation
To Quotation
begin Quotation
with, Quotation
it Quotation
is Quotation
somewhat Quotation
obscure. Quotation
A Quotation
thousand Quotation
years Quotation
ago Quotation
a Quotation
monk, Quotation
dressed Quotation
in Quotation
black, Quotation
wandered Quotation
about Quotation
the Quotation
desert, Quotation
somewhere Quotation
in Quotation
Syria Quotation
or Quotation
Arabia. Quotation
. Quotation
. Quotation
. Quotation
Some Quotation
miles Quotation
from Quotation
where Quotation
he Quotation
was, Quotation
some Quotation
fisherman Quotation
saw Quotation
another Quotation
black Quotation
monk, Quotation
who Quotation
was Quotation
moving Quotation
slowly Quotation
over Quotation
the Quotation
surface Quotation
of Quotation
a Quotation
lake. Quotation
This Quotation
second Quotation
monk Quotation
was Quotation
a Quotation
mirage. Quotation
Now Quotation
forget Quotation
all Quotation
the Quotation
laws Quotation
of Quotation
optics, Quotation
which Quotation
the Quotation
legend Quotation
does Quotation
not Quotation
recognise, Quotation
and Quotation
listen Quotation
to Quotation
the Quotation
rest. Quotation
From Quotation
that Quotation
mirage Quotation
there Quotation
was Quotation
cast Quotation
another Quotation
mirage, Quotation
then Quotation
from Quotation
that Quotation
other Quotation
a Quotation
third, Quotation
so Quotation
that Quotation
the Quotation
image Quotation
of Quotation
the Quotation
black Quotation
monk Quotation
began Quotation
to Quotation
be Quotation
repeated Quotation
endlessly Quotation
from Quotation
one Quotation
layer Quotation
of Quotation
the Quotation
atmosphere Quotation
to Quotation
another. Quotation
So Quotation
that Quotation
he Quotation
was Quotation
seen Quotation
at Quotation
one Quotation
time Quotation
in Quotation
Africa, Quotation
at Quotation
another Quotation
in Quotation
Spain, Quotation
then Quotation
in Quotation
Italy, Quotation
then Quotation
in Quotation
the Quotation
Far Quotation
North. Quotation
. Quotation
. Quotation
. Quotation
Then Quotation
he Quotation
passed Quotation
out Quotation
of Quotation
the Quotation
atmosphere Quotation
of Quotation
the Quotation
earth, Quotation
and Quotation
now Quotation
he Quotation
is Quotation
wandering Quotation
all Quotation
over Quotation
the Quotation
universe, Quotation
still Quotation
never Quotation
coming Quotation
into Quotation
conditions Quotation
in Quotation
which Quotation
he Quotation
might Quotation
disappear. Quotation
Possibly Quotation
he Quotation
may Quotation
be Quotation
seen Quotation
now Quotation
in Quotation
Mars Quotation
or Quotation
in Quotation
some Quotation
star Quotation
of Quotation
the Quotation
Southern Quotation
Cross. Quotation
But, Quotation
my Quotation
dear, Quotation
the Quotation
real Quotation
point Quotation
on Quotation
which Quotation
the Quotation
whole Quotation
legend Quotation
hangs Quotation
lies Quotation
in Quotation
the Quotation
fact Quotation
that, Quotation
exactly Quotation
a Quotation
thousand Quotation
years Quotation
from Quotation
the Quotation
day Quotation
when Quotation
the Quotation
monk Quotation
walked Quotation
in Quotation
the Quotation
desert, Quotation
the Quotation
mirage Quotation
will Quotation
return Quotation
to Quotation
the Quotation
atmosphere Quotation
of Quotation
the Quotation
earth Quotation
again Quotation
and Quotation
will Quotation
appear Quotation
to Quotation
men. Quotation
And Quotation
it Quotation
seems Quotation
that Quotation
the Quotation
thousand Quotation
years Quotation
is Quotation
almost Quotation
up Quotation
. Quotation
. Quotation
. Quotation
. Quotation
According Quotation
to Quotation
the Quotation
legend, Quotation
we Quotation
may Quotation
look Quotation
out Quotation
for Quotation
the Quotation
black Quotation
monk Quotation
to-day Quotation
or Quotation
to-morrow." Quotation
"A Quotation
queer Quotation
mirage," Quotation
said Cue
Tanya, Entity
who O
did O
not O
like O
the O
legend. O
"But Quotation
the Quotation
most Quotation
wonderful Quotation
part Quotation
of Quotation
it Quotation
all," Quotation
laughed Cue
Kovrin, Entity
"is Quotation
that Quotation
I Quotation
simply Quotation
cannot Quotation
recall Quotation
where Quotation
I Quotation
got Quotation
this Quotation
legend Quotation
from. Quotation
Have Quotation
I Quotation
read Quotation
it Quotation
somewhere? Quotation
Have Quotation
I Quotation
heard Quotation
it? Quotation
Or Quotation
perhaps Quotation
I Quotation
dreamed Quotation
of Quotation
the Quotation
black Quotation
monk. Quotation
I Quotation
swear Quotation
I Quotation
don't Quotation
remember. Quotation
But Quotation
the Quotation
legend Quotation
interests Quotation
me. Quotation
I Quotation
have Quotation
been Quotation
thinking Quotation
about Quotation
it Quotation
all Quotation
day." Quotation
Letting O
Tanya O
go O
back O
to O
her O
visitors, O
he O
went O
out O
of O
the O
house, O
and, O
lost O
in O
meditation, O
walked O
by O
the O
flower-beds. O
The O
sun O
was O
already O
setting. O
The O
flowers, O
having O
just O
been O
watered, O
gave O
forth O
a O
damp, O
irritating O
fragrance. O
Indoors O
they O
began O
singing O
again, O
and O
in O
the O
distance O
the O
violin O
had O
the O
effect O
of O
a O
human O
voice. O
Kovrin, O
racking O
his O
brains O
to O
remember O
where O
he O
had O
read O
or O
heard O
the O
legend, O
turned O
slowly O
towards O
the O
park, O
and O
unconsciously O
went O
as O
far O
as O
the O
river. O
By O
a O
little O
path O
that O
ran O
along O
the O
steep O
bank, O
between O
the O
bare O
roots, O
he O
went O
down O
to O
the O
water, O
disturbed O
the O
peewits O
there O
and O
frightened O
two O
ducks. O
The O
last O
rays O
of O
the O
setting O
sun O
still O
threw O
light O
here O
and O
there O
on O
the O
gloomy O
pines, O
but O
it O
was O
quite O
dark O
on O
the O
surface O
of O
the O
river. O
Kovrin O
crossed O
to O
the O
other O
side O
by O
the O
narrow O
bridge. O
Before O
him O
lay O
a O
wide O
field O
covered O
with O
young O
rye O
not O
yet O
in O
blossom. O
There O
was O
no O
living O
habitation, O
no O
living O
soul O
in O
the O
distance, O
and O
it O
seemed O
as O
though O
the O
little O
path, O
if O
one O
went O
along O
it, O
would O
take O
one O
to O
the O
unknown, O
mysterious O
place O
where O
the O
sun O
had O
just O
gone O
down, O
and O
where O
the O
evening O
glow O
was O
flaming O
in O
immensity O
and O
splendour. O
"How O
open, O
how O
free, O
how O
still O
it O
is O
here!" O
thought O
Kovrin, O
walking O
along O
the O
path. O
"And O
it O
feels O
as O
though O
all O
the O
world O
were O
watching O
me, O
hiding O
and O
waiting O
for O
me O
to O
understand O
it. O
. O
. O
." O
But O
then O
waves O
began O
running O
across O
the O
rye, O
and O
a O
light O
evening O
breeze O
softly O
touched O
his O
uncovered O
head. O
A O
minute O
later O
there O
was O
another O
gust O
of O
wind, O
but O
stronger-- O
the O
rye O
began O
rustling, O
and O
he O
heard O
behind O
him O
the O
hollow O
murmur O
of O
the O
pines. O
Kovrin O
stood O
still O
in O
amazement. O
From O
the O
horizon O
there O
rose O
up O
to O
the O
sky, O
like O
a O
whirlwind O
or O
a O
waterspout, O
a O
tall O
black O
column. O
Its O
outline O
was O
indistinct, O
but O
from O
the O
first O
instant O
it O
could O
be O
seen O
that O
it O
was O
not O
standing O
still, O
but O
moving O
with O
fearful O
rapidity, O
moving O
straight O
towards O
Kovrin, O
and O
the O
nearer O
it O
came O
the O
smaller O
and O
the O
more O
distinct O
it O
was. O
Kovrin O
moved O
aside O
into O
the O
rye O
to O
make O
way O
for O
it, O
and O
only O
just O
had O
time O
to O
do O
so. O
A O
monk, O
dressed O
in O
black, O
with O
a O
grey O
head O
and O
black O
eyebrows, O
his O
arms O
crossed O
over O
his O
breast, O
floated O
by O
him. O
. O
. O
. O
His O
bare O
feet O
did O
not O
touch O
the O
earth. O
After O
he O
had O
floated O
twenty O
feet O
beyond O
him, O
he O
looked O
round O
at O
Kovrin, O
and O
nodded O
to O
him O
with O
a O
friendly O
but O
sly O
smile. O
But O
what O
a O
pale, O
fearfully O
pale, O
thin O
face! O
Beginning O
to O
grow O
larger O
again, O
he O
flew O
across O
the O
river, O
collided O
noiselessly O
with O
the O
clay O
bank O
and O
pines, O
and O
passing O
through O
them, O
vanished O
like O
smoke. O
"Why, Quotation
you Quotation
see," Quotation
muttered Cue
Kovrin, Entity
"there Quotation
must Quotation
be Quotation
truth Quotation
in Quotation
the Quotation
legend." Quotation
Without O
trying O
to O
explain O
to O
himself O
the O
strange O
apparition, O
glad O
that O
he O
had O
succeeded O
in O
seeing O
so O
near O
and O
so O
distinctly, O
not O
only O
the O
monk's O
black O
garments, O
but O
even O
his O
face O
and O
eyes, O
agreeably O
excited, O
he O
went O
back O
to O
the O
house. O
In O
the O
park O
and O
in O
the O
garden O
people O
were O
moving O
about O
quietly, O
in O
the O
house O
they O
were O
playing-- O
so O
he O
alone O
had O
seen O
the O
monk. O
He O
had O
an O
intense O
desire O
to O
tell O
Tanya O
and O
Yegor O
Semyonitch, O
but O
he O
reflected O
that O
they O
would O
certainly O
think O
his O
words O
the O
ravings O
of O
delirium, O
and O
that O
would O
frighten O
them; O
he O
had O
better O
say O
nothing. O
He O
laughed O
aloud, O
sang, O
and O
danced O
the O
mazurka; O
he O
was O
in O
high O
spirits, O
and O
all O
of O
them, O
the O
visitors O
and O
Tanya, O
thought O
he O
had O
a O
peculiar O
look, O
radiant O
and O
inspired, O
and O
that O
he O
was O
very O
interesting. O
III O
After O
supper, O
when O
the O
visitors O
had O
gone, O
he O
went O
to O
his O
room O
and O
lay O
down O
on O
the O
sofa: O
he Entity
wanted O
to O
think O
about O
the O
monk. O
But O
a O
minute O
later O
Tanya O
came O
in. O
"Here, Quotation
Andryusha; Quotation
read Quotation
father's Quotation
articles," Quotation
she Entity
said, Cue
giving O
him Entity
a O
bundle O
of O
pamphlets O
and O
proofs. O
"They Quotation
are Quotation
splendid Quotation
articles. Quotation
He Quotation
writes Quotation
capitally." Quotation
"Capitally, Quotation
indeed!" Quotation
said Cue
Yegor Entity
Semyonitch, Entity
following O
her Entity
and O
smiling O
constrainedly; O
he O
was O
ashamed. O
"Don't Quotation
listen Quotation
to Quotation
her, Quotation
please; Quotation
don't Quotation
read Quotation
them! Quotation
Though, Quotation
if Quotation
you Quotation
want Quotation
to Quotation
go Quotation
to Quotation
sleep, Quotation
read Quotation
them Quotation
by Quotation
all Quotation
means; Quotation
they Quotation
are Quotation
a Quotation
fine Quotation
soporific." Quotation
"I Quotation
think Quotation
they Quotation
are Quotation
splendid Quotation
articles," Quotation
said Cue
Tanya, Entity
with O
deep O
conviction. O
"You Quotation
read Quotation
them, Quotation
Andryusha, Quotation
and Quotation
persuade Quotation
father Quotation
to Quotation
write Quotation
oftener. Quotation
He Quotation
could Quotation
write Quotation
a Quotation
complete Quotation
manual Quotation
of Quotation
horticulture." Quotation
Yegor Entity
Semyonitch Entity
gave O
a O
forced O
laugh, O
blushed, O
and O
began O
uttering Cue
the Quotation
phrases Quotation
usually Quotation
made Quotation
us Quotation
of Quotation
by Quotation
an Quotation
embarrassed Quotation
author. Quotation
At O
last O
he O
began O
to O
give O
way. O
"In Quotation
that Quotation
case, Quotation
begin Quotation
with Quotation
Gaucher's Quotation
article Quotation
and Quotation
these Quotation
Russian Quotation
articles," Quotation
he Entity
muttered, Cue
turning O
over O
the O
pamphlets O
with O
a O
trembling O
hand, O
"or Quotation
else Quotation
you Quotation
won't Quotation
understand. Quotation
Before Quotation
you Quotation
read Quotation
my Quotation
objections, Quotation
you Quotation
must Quotation
know Quotation
what Quotation
I Quotation
am Quotation
objecting Quotation
to. Quotation
But Quotation
it's Quotation
all Quotation
nonsense Quotation
. Quotation
. Quotation
. Quotation
tiresome Quotation
stuff. Quotation
Besides, Quotation
I Quotation
believe Quotation
it's Quotation
bedtime." Quotation
Tanya O
went O
away. O
Yegor O
Semyonitch O
sat O
down O
on O
the O
sofa O
by O
Kovrin Entity
and O
heaved O
a O
deep O
sigh. O
"Yes, Quotation
my Quotation
boy. Quotation
. Quotation
." Quotation
he Entity
began Cue
after O
a O
pause. O
"That's Quotation
how Quotation
it Quotation
is, Quotation
my Quotation
dear Quotation
lecturer. Quotation
Here Quotation
I Quotation
write Quotation
articles, Quotation
and Quotation
take Quotation
part Quotation
in Quotation
exhibitions, Quotation
and Quotation
receive Quotation
medals. Quotation
. Quotation
. Quotation
. Quotation
Pesotsky, Quotation
they Quotation
say, Quotation
has Quotation
apples Quotation
the Quotation
size Quotation
of Quotation
a Quotation
head, Quotation
and Quotation
Pesotsky, Quotation
they Quotation
say, Quotation
has Quotation
made Quotation
his Quotation
fortune Quotation
with Quotation
his Quotation
garden. Quotation
In Quotation
short, Quotation
'Kotcheby Quotation
is Quotation
rich Quotation
and Quotation
glorious.' Quotation
But Quotation
one Quotation
asks Quotation
oneself: Quotation
what Quotation
is Quotation
it Quotation
all Quotation
for? Quotation
The Quotation
garden Quotation
is Quotation
certainly Quotation
fine, Quotation
a Quotation
model. Quotation
It's Quotation
not Quotation
really Quotation
a Quotation
garden, Quotation
but Quotation
a Quotation
regular Quotation
institution, Quotation
which Quotation
is Quotation
of Quotation
the Quotation
greatest Quotation
public Quotation
importance Quotation
because Quotation
it Quotation
marks, Quotation
so Quotation
to Quotation
say, Quotation
a Quotation
new Quotation
era Quotation
in Quotation
Russian Quotation
agriculture Quotation
and Quotation
Russian Quotation
industry. Quotation
But, Quotation
what's Quotation
it Quotation
for? Quotation
What's Quotation
the Quotation
object Quotation
of Quotation
it?" Quotation
"The Quotation
fact Quotation
speaks Quotation
for Quotation
itself." Quotation
"I Quotation
do Quotation
not Quotation
mean Quotation
in Quotation
that Quotation
sense. Quotation
I Quotation
meant Quotation
to Quotation
ask: Quotation
what Quotation
will Quotation
happen Quotation
to Quotation
the Quotation
garden Quotation
when Quotation
I Quotation
die? Quotation
In Quotation
the Quotation
condition Quotation
in Quotation
which Quotation
you Quotation
see Quotation
it Quotation
now, Quotation
it Quotation
would Quotation
not Quotation
be Quotation
maintained Quotation
for Quotation
one Quotation
month Quotation
without Quotation
me. Quotation
The Quotation
whole Quotation
secret Quotation
of Quotation
success Quotation
lies Quotation
not Quotation
in Quotation
its Quotation
being Quotation
a Quotation
big Quotation
garden Quotation
or Quotation
a Quotation
great Quotation
number Quotation
of Quotation
labourers Quotation
being Quotation
employed Quotation
in Quotation
it, Quotation
but Quotation
in Quotation
the Quotation
fact Quotation
that Quotation
I Quotation
love Quotation
the Quotation
work. Quotation
Do Quotation
you Quotation
understand? Quotation
I Quotation
love Quotation
it Quotation
perhaps Quotation
more Quotation
than Quotation
myself. Quotation
Look Quotation
at Quotation
me; Quotation
I Quotation
do Quotation
everything Quotation
myself. Quotation
I Quotation
work Quotation
from Quotation
morning Quotation
to Quotation
night: Quotation
I Quotation
do Quotation
all Quotation
the Quotation
grafting Quotation
myself, Quotation
the Quotation
pruning Quotation
myself, Quotation
the Quotation
planting Quotation
myself. Quotation
I Quotation
do Quotation
it Quotation
all Quotation
myself: Quotation
when Quotation
any Quotation
one Quotation
helps Quotation
me Quotation
I Quotation
am Quotation
jealous Quotation
and Quotation
irritable Quotation
till Quotation
I Quotation
am Quotation
rude. Quotation
The Quotation
whole Quotation
secret Quotation
lies Quotation
in Quotation
loving Quotation
it-- Quotation
that Quotation
is, Quotation
in Quotation
the Quotation
sharp Quotation
eye Quotation
of Quotation
the Quotation
master; Quotation
yes, Quotation
and Quotation
in Quotation
the Quotation
master's Quotation
hands, Quotation
and Quotation
in Quotation
the Quotation
feeling Quotation
that Quotation
makes Quotation
one, Quotation
when Quotation
one Quotation
goes Quotation
anywhere Quotation
for Quotation
an Quotation
hour's Quotation
visit, Quotation
sit, Quotation
ill Quotation
at Quotation
ease, Quotation
with Quotation
one's Quotation
heart Quotation
far Quotation
away, Quotation
afraid Quotation
that Quotation
something Quotation
may Quotation
have Quotation
happened Quotation
in Quotation
the Quotation
garden. Quotation
But Quotation
when Quotation
I Quotation
die, Quotation
who Quotation
will Quotation
look Quotation
after Quotation
it? Quotation
Who Quotation
will Quotation
work? Quotation
The Quotation
gardener? Quotation
The Quotation
labourers? Quotation
Yes? Quotation
But Quotation
I Quotation
will Quotation
tell Quotation
you, Quotation
my Quotation
dear Quotation
fellow, Quotation
the Quotation
worst Quotation
enemy Quotation
in Quotation
the Quotation
garden Quotation
is Quotation
not Quotation
a Quotation
hare, Quotation
not Quotation
a Quotation
cockchafer, Quotation
and Quotation
not Quotation
the Quotation
frost, Quotation
but Quotation
any Quotation
outside Quotation
person." Quotation
"And Quotation
Tanya?" Quotation
asked Cue
Kovrin, Entity
laughing. O
"She Quotation
can't Quotation
be Quotation
more Quotation
harmful Quotation
than Quotation
a Quotation
hare? Quotation
She Quotation
loves Quotation
the Quotation
work Quotation
and Quotation
understands Quotation
it." Quotation
"Yes, Quotation
she Quotation
loves Quotation
it Quotation
and Quotation
understands Quotation
it. Quotation
If Quotation
after Quotation
my Quotation
death Quotation
the Quotation
garden Quotation
goes Quotation
to Quotation
her Quotation
and Quotation
she Quotation
is Quotation
the Quotation
mistress, Quotation
of Quotation
course Quotation
nothing Quotation
better Quotation
could Quotation
be Quotation
wished. Quotation
But Quotation
if, Quotation
which Quotation
God Quotation
forbid, Quotation
she Quotation
should Quotation
marry," Quotation
Yegor Entity
Semyonitch Entity
whispered, Cue
and O
looked O
with O
a O
frightened O
look O
at O
Kovrin, Entity
"that's Quotation
just Quotation
it. Quotation
If Quotation
she Quotation
marries Quotation
and Quotation
children Quotation
come, Quotation
she Quotation
will Quotation
have Quotation
no Quotation
time Quotation
to Quotation
think Quotation
about Quotation
the Quotation
garden. Quotation
What Quotation
I Quotation
fear Quotation
most Quotation
is: Quotation
she Quotation
will Quotation
marry Quotation
some Quotation
fine Quotation
gentleman, Quotation
and Quotation
he Quotation
will Quotation
be Quotation
greedy, Quotation
and Quotation
he Quotation
will Quotation
let Quotation
the Quotation
garden Quotation
to Quotation
people Quotation
who Quotation
will Quotation
run Quotation
it Quotation
for Quotation
profit, Quotation
and Quotation
everything Quotation
will Quotation
go Quotation
to Quotation
the Quotation
devil Quotation
the Quotation
very Quotation
first Quotation
year! Quotation
In Quotation
our Quotation
work Quotation
females Quotation
are Quotation
the Quotation
scourge Quotation
of Quotation
God!" Quotation
Yegor Entity
Semyonitch Entity
sighed O
and O
paused O
for O
a O
while. O
"Perhaps Quotation
it Quotation
is Quotation
egoism, Quotation
but Quotation
I Quotation
tell Quotation
you Quotation
frankly: Quotation
I Quotation
don't Quotation
want Quotation
Tanya Quotation
to Quotation
get Quotation
married. Quotation
I Quotation
am Quotation
afraid Quotation
of Quotation
it! Quotation
There Quotation
is Quotation
one Quotation
young Quotation
dandy Quotation
comes Quotation
to Quotation
see Quotation
us, Quotation
bringing Quotation
his Quotation
violin Quotation
and Quotation
scraping Quotation
on Quotation
it; Quotation
I Quotation
know Quotation
Tanya Quotation
will Quotation
not Quotation
marry Quotation
him, Quotation
I Quotation
know Quotation
it Quotation
quite Quotation
well; Quotation
but Quotation
I Quotation
can't Quotation
bear Quotation
to Quotation
see Quotation
him! Quotation
Altogether, Quotation
my Quotation
boy, Quotation
I Quotation
am Quotation
very Quotation
queer. Quotation
I Quotation
know Quotation
that." Quotation
Yegor O
Semyonitch O
got O
up O
and O
walked O
about O
the O
room O
in O
excitement, O
and O
it O
was O
evident O
that O
he O
wanted O
to O
say O
something O
very O
important, O
but O
could O
not O
bring O
himself O
to O
it. O
"I Quotation
am Quotation
very Quotation
fond Quotation
of Quotation
you, Quotation
and Quotation
so Quotation
I Quotation
am Quotation
going Quotation
to Quotation
speak Quotation
to Quotation
you Quotation
openly," Quotation
he Entity
decided O
at O
last, O
thrusting O
his O
hands O
into O
his O
pockets. O
"I Quotation
deal Quotation
plainly Quotation
with Quotation
certain Quotation
delicate Quotation
questions, Quotation
and Quotation
say Quotation
exactly Quotation
what Quotation
I Quotation
think, Quotation
and Quotation
I Quotation
cannot Quotation
endure Quotation
so-called Quotation
hidden Quotation
thoughts. Quotation
I Quotation
will Quotation
speak Quotation
plainly: Quotation
you Quotation
are Quotation
the Quotation
only Quotation
man Quotation
to Quotation
whom Quotation
I Quotation
should Quotation
not Quotation
be Quotation
afraid Quotation
to Quotation
marry Quotation
my Quotation
daughter. Quotation
You Quotation
are Quotation
a Quotation
clever Quotation
man Quotation
with Quotation
a Quotation
good Quotation
heart, Quotation
and Quotation
would Quotation
not Quotation
let Quotation
my Quotation
beloved Quotation
work Quotation
go Quotation
to Quotation
ruin; Quotation
and Quotation
the Quotation
chief Quotation
reason Quotation
is Quotation
that Quotation
I Quotation
love Quotation
you Quotation
as Quotation
a Quotation
son, Quotation
and Quotation
I Quotation
am Quotation
proud Quotation
of Quotation
you. Quotation
If Quotation
Tanya Quotation
and Quotation
you Quotation
could Quotation
get Quotation
up Quotation
a Quotation
romance Quotation
somehow, Quotation
then-- Quotation
well! Quotation
I Quotation
should Quotation
be Quotation
very Quotation
glad Quotation
and Quotation
even Quotation
happy. Quotation
I Quotation
tell Quotation
you Quotation
this Quotation
plainly, Quotation
without Quotation
mincing Quotation
matters, Quotation
like Quotation
an Quotation
honest Quotation
man." Quotation
Kovrin Entity
laughed. O
Yegor O
Semyonitch O
opened O
the O
door O
to O
go O
out, O
and O
stood O
in O
the O
doorway. O
"If Quotation
Tanya Quotation
and Quotation
you Quotation
had Quotation
a Quotation
son, Quotation
I Quotation
would Quotation
make Quotation
a Quotation
horticulturist Quotation
of Quotation
him," Quotation
he Entity
said, Cue
after O
a O
moment's O
thought. O
"However, Quotation
this Quotation
is Quotation
idle Quotation
dreaming. Quotation
Goodnight." Quotation
Left O
alone, O
Kovrin O
settled O
himself O
more O
comfortably O
on O
the O
sofa O
and O
took O
up O
the O
articles. O
The O
title O
of O
one O
was O
"On O
Intercropping"; O
of O
another, O
"A O
few O
Words O
on O
the O
Remarks O
of O
Monsieur O
Z. O
concerning O
the O
Trenching O
of O
the O
Soil O
for O
a O
New O
Garden"; O
a O
third, O
"Additional O
Matter O
concerning O
Grafting O
with O
a O
Dormant O
Bud"; O
and O
they O
were O
all O
of O
the O
same O
sort. O
But O
what O
a O
restless, O
jerky O
tone! O
What O
nervous, O
almost O
hysterical O
passion! O
Here O
was O
an O
article, O
one O
would O
have O
thought, O
with O
most O
peaceable O
and O
impersonal O
contents: O
the O
subject O
of O
it O
was O
the O
Russian O
Antonovsky O
Apple. O
But O
Yegor O
Semyonitch O
began O
it O
with O
"Audiatur O
altera O
pars," O
and O
finished O
it O
with O
"Sapienti O
sat"; O
and O
between O
these O
two O
quotations O
a O
perfect O
torrent O
of O
venomous O
phrases O
directed O
"at O
the O
learned O
ignorance O
of O
our O
recognised O
horticultural O
authorities, O
who O
observe O
Nature O
from O
the O
height O
of O
their O
university O
chairs," O
or O
at O
Monsieur O
Gaucher, O
"whose O
success O
has O
been O
the O
work O
of O
the O
vulgar O
and O
the O
dilettanti." O
"And O
then O
followed O
an O
inappropriate, O
affected, O
and O
insincere O
regret O
that O
peasants O
who O
stole O
fruit O
and O
broke O
the O
branches O
could O
not O
nowadays O
be O
flogged. O
 O
It O
is O
beautiful, O
charming, O
healthy O
work, O
but O
even O
in O
this O
there O
is O
strife O
and O
passion," O
thought O
Kovrin, O
"I O
suppose O
that O
everywhere O
and O
in O
all O
careers O
men O
of O
ideas O
are O
nervous, O
and O
marked O
by O
exaggerated O
sensitiveness. O
Most O
likely O
it O
must O
be O
so." O
He O
thought O
of O
Tanya, O
who O
was O
so O
pleased O
with O
Yegor O
Semyonitch's O
articles. O
Small, O
pale, O
and O
so O
thin O
that O
her O
shoulder-blades O
stuck O
out, O
her O
eyes, O
wide O
and O
open, O
dark O
and O
intelligent, O
had O
an O
intent O
gaze, O
as O
though O
looking O
for O
something. O
She O
walked O
like O
her O
father O
with O
a O
little O
hurried O
step. O
She O
talked O
a O
great O
deal O
and O
was O
fond O
of O
arguing, O
accompanying O
every O
phrase, O
however O
insignificant, O
with O
expressive O
mimicry O
and O
gesticulation. O
No O
doubt O
she O
was O
nervous O
in O
the O
extreme. O
Kovrin O
went O
on O
reading O
the O
articles, O
but O
he O
understood O
nothing O
of O
them, O
and O
flung O
them O
aside. O
The O
same O
pleasant O
excitement O
with O
which O
he O
had O
earlier O
in O
the O
evening O
danced O
the O
mazurka O
and O
listened O
to O
the O
music O
was O
now O
mastering O
him O
again O
and O
rousing O
a O
multitude O
of O
thoughts. O
He O
got O
up O
and O
began O
walking O
about O
the O
room, O
thinking O
about O
the O
black O
monk. O
It O
occurred O
to O
him O
that O
if O
this O
strange, O
supernatural O
monk O
had O
appeared O
to O
him O
only, O
that O
meant O
that O
he O
was O
ill O
and O
had O
reached O
the O
point O
of O
having O
hallucinations. O
This O
reflection O
frightened O
him, O
but O
not O
for O
long. O
"But O
I O
am O
all O
right, O
and O
I O
am O
doing O
no O
harm O
to O
any O
one; O
so O
there O
is O
no O
harm O
in O
my O
hallucinations," O
he O
thought; O
and O
he O
felt O
happy O
again. O
He O
sat O
down O
on O
the O
sofa O
and O
clasped O
his O
hands O
round O
his O
head. O
Restraining O
the O
unaccountable O
joy O
which O
filled O
his O
whole O
being, O
he O
then O
paced O
up O
and O
down O
again, O
and O
sat O
down O
to O
his O
work. O
But O
the O
thought O
that O
he O
read O
in O
the O
book O
did O
not O
satisfy O
him. O
He O
wanted O
something O
gigantic, O
unfathomable, O
stupendous. O
Towards O
morning O
he O
undressed O
and O
reluctantly O
went O
to O
bed: O
he O
ought O
to O
sleep. O
When O
he O
heard O
the O
footsteps O
of O
Yegor O
Semyonitch O
going O
out O
into O
the O
garden, O
Kovrin O
rang O
the O
bell O
and O
asked O
the O
footman O
to O
bring O
him O
some O
wine. O
He O
drank O
several O
glasses O
of O
Lafitte, O
then O
wrapped O
himself O
up, O
head O
and O
all; O
his O
consciousness O
grew O
clouded O
and O
he O
fell O
asleep. O
IV O
Yegor O
Semyonitch O
and O
Tanya O
often O
quarrelled O
and O
said O
nasty O
things O
to O
each O
other. O
They O
quarrelled O
about O
something O
that O
morning. O
Tanya O
burst O
out O
crying O
and O
went O
to O
her O
room. O
She O
would O
not O
come O
down O
to O
dinner O
nor O
to O
tea. O
At O
first O
Yegor O
Semyonitch O
went O
about O
looking O
sulky O
and O
dignified, O
as O
though O
to O
give O
every O
one O
to O
understand O
that O
for O
him O
the O
claims O
of O
justice O
and O
good O
order O
were O
more O
important O
than O
anything O
else O
in O
the O
world; O
but O
he O
could O
not O
keep O
it O
up O
for O
long, O
and O
soon O
sank O
into O
depression. O
He Entity
walked O
about O
the O
park O
dejectedly, O
continually O
sighing: Cue
"Oh, Quotation
my Quotation
God! Quotation
My Quotation
God!" Quotation
and O
at O
dinner O
did O
not O
eat O
a O
morsel. O
At O
last, O
guilty O
and O
conscience-stricken, O
he Entity
knocked O
at O
the O
locked O
door O
and O
called Cue
timidly: O
"Tanya! Quotation
Tanya!" Quotation
And O
from O
behind O
the O
door O
came O
a Entity
faint Entity
voice, Entity
weak O
with O
crying O
but O
still O
determined: O
"Leave Quotation
me Quotation
alone, Quotation
if Quotation
you Quotation
please." Quotation
The O
depression O
of O
the O
master O
and O
mistress O
was O
reflected O
in O
the O
whole O
household, O
even O
in O
the O
labourers O
working O
in O
the O
garden. O
Kovrin O
was O
absorbed O
in O
his O
interesting O
work, O
but O
at O
last O
he, O
too, O
felt O
dreary O
and O
uncomfortable. O
To O
dissipate O
the O
general O
ill-humour O
in O
some O
way, O
he O
made O
up O
his O
mind O
to O
intervene, O
and O
towards O
evening O
he O
knocked O
at O
Tanya's O
door. O
He O
was O
admitted. O
"Fie, Quotation
fie, Quotation
for Quotation
shame!" Quotation
he Entity
began Cue
playfully, O
looking O
with O
surprise O
at O
Tanya's Entity
tear-stained, O
woebegone O
face, O
flushed O
in O
patches O
with O
crying. O
"Is Quotation
it Quotation
really Quotation
so Quotation
serious? Quotation
Fie, Quotation
fie!" Quotation
"But Quotation
if Quotation
you Quotation
knew Quotation
how Quotation
he Quotation
tortures Quotation
me!" Quotation
she Entity
said, Cue
and O
floods O
of O
scalding O
tears O
streamed O
from O
her O
big O
eyes. O
"He Quotation
torments Quotation
me Quotation
to Quotation
death," Quotation
she Entity
went Cue
on, Cue
wringing O
her O
hands. O
"I Quotation
said Quotation
nothing Quotation
to Quotation
him Quotation
. Quotation
. Quotation
. Quotation
nothing Quotation
. Quotation
. Quotation

You Quotation
know Quotation

. Quotation
. Quotation

I. Quotation

said Quotation
. Quotation
. Quotation
. Quotation
a Quotation
lot Quotation
of Quotation
horrible Quotation
insulting Quotation
things Quotation
to Quotation
me. Quotation
What Quotation
for?" Quotation
"There, Quotation
there," Quotation
said Cue
Kovrin, Entity
smoothing O
her Entity
hair. O
"You've Quotation
quarrelled Quotation
with Quotation
each Quotation
other, Quotation
you've Quotation
cried, Quotation
and Quotation
that's Quotation
enough. Quotation
You Quotation
must Quotation
not Quotation
be Quotation
angry Quotation
for Quotation
long-- Quotation
that's Quotation
wrong Quotation
. Quotation
. Quotation
. Quotation
all Quotation
the Quotation
more Quotation
as Quotation
he Quotation
loves Quotation
you Quotation
beyond Quotation
everything." Quotation
"He Quotation
has Quotation
. Quotation
. Quotation
. Quotation
has Quotation
spoiled Quotation
my Quotation
whole Quotation
life," Quotation
Tanya Entity
went Cue
on, Cue
sobbing. O
"I Quotation
hear Quotation
nothing Quotation
but Quotation
abuse Quotation
and Quotation
. Quotation
. Quotation
. Quotation
insults. Quotation
He Quotation
thinks Quotation
I Quotation

in Quotation
the Quotation
house. Quotation
Well! Quotation
He Quotation
is Quotation
right. Quotation
I Quotation
shall Quotation
go Quotation
away Quotation
to-morrow; Quotation
I Quotation
shall Quotation
become Quotation
a Quotation
telegraph Quotation
clerk. Quotation
. Quotation
. Quotation
. Quotation
I Quotation
don't Quotation

"Come, Quotation
come, Quotation
come. Quotation
. Quotation
. Quotation
. Quotation
You Quotation
mustn't Quotation
cry, Quotation
Tanya. Quotation
You Quotation
mustn't, Quotation
dear Quotation
. Quotation
. Quotation
. Quotation
. Quotation
You Quotation
are Quotation
both Quotation
hot-tempered Quotation

and Quotation
you Quotation
are Quotation
both Quotation
to Quotation
blame. Quotation
Come Quotation
along; Quotation
I Quotation
will Quotation
reconcile Quotation
you." Quotation
Kovrin O
talked O
affectionately O
and O
persuasively, O
while O
she O
went O
on O
crying, O
twitching O
her O
shoulders O
and O
wringing O
her O
hands, O
as O
though O
some O
terrible O
misfortune O
had O
really O
befallen O
her. O
He O
felt O
all O
the O
sorrier O
for O
her O
because O
her O
grief O
was O
not O
a O
serious O
one, O
yet O
she O
suffered O
extremely. O
What O
trivialities O
were O
enough O
to O
make O
this O
little O
creature O
miserable O
for O
a O
whole O
day, O
perhaps O
for O
her O
whole O
life! O
Comforting O
Tanya, O
Kovrin O
thought O
that, O
apart O
from O
this O
girl O
and O
her O
father, O
he O
might O
hunt O
the O
world O
over O
and O
would O
not O
find O
people O
who O
would O
love O
him O
as O
one O
of O
themselves, O
as O
one O
of O
their O
kindred. O
If O
it O
had O
not O
been O
for O
those O
two O
he O
might O
very O
likely, O
having O
lost O
his O
father O
and O
mother O
in O
early O
childhood, O
never O
to O
the O
day O
of O
his O
death O
have O
known O
what O
was O
meant O
by O
genuine O
affection O
and O
that O
naïve, O
uncritical O
love O
which O
is O
only O
lavished O
on O
very O
close O
blood O
relations; O
and O
he O
felt O
that O
the O
nerves O
of O
this O
weeping, O
shaking O
girl O
responded O
to O
his O
half-sick, O
overstrained O
nerves O
like O
iron O
to O
a O
magnet. O
He O
never O
could O
have O
loved O
a O
healthy, O
strong, O
rosy-cheeked O
woman, O
but O
pale, O
weak, O
unhappy O
Tanya O
attracted O
him. O
And O
he O
liked O
stroking O
her O
hair O
and O
her O
shoulders, O
pressing O
her O
hand O
and O
wiping O
away O
her O
tears. O
. O
. O
. O
At O
last O
she O
left O
off O
crying. O
She Entity
went Cue
on Cue
for O
a O
long O
time O
complaining Quotation
of Quotation
her Quotation
father Quotation
and Quotation
her Quotation
hard, Quotation
insufferable Quotation
life Quotation
in Quotation
that Quotation
house, Quotation
entreating O
Kovrin Entity
to O
put O
himself O
in O
her O
place; O
then O
she O
began, O
little O
by O
little, O
smiling, O
and O
sighing O
that O
God O
had O
given O
her O
such O
a O
bad O
temper. O
At O
last, O
laughing O
aloud, O
she Entity
called Cue
herself O
a Quotation
fool, Quotation
and O
ran O
out O
of O
the O
room. O
When O
a O
little O
later O
Kovrin O
went O
into O
the O
garden, O
Yegor O
Semyonitch O
and O
Tanya O
were O
walking O
side O
by O
side O
along O
an O
avenue O
as O
though O
nothing O
had O
happened, O
and O
both O
were O
eating O
rye O
bread O
with O
salt O
on O
it, O
as O
both O
were O
hungry. O
V O
Glad O
that O
he O
had O
been O
so O
successful O
in O
the O
part O
of O
peacemaker, O
Kovrin O
went O
into O
the O
park. O
Sitting O
on O
a O
garden O
seat, O
thinking, O
he O
heard O
the O
rattle O
of O
a O
carriage O
and O
a O
feminine O
laugh-- O
visitors O
were O
arriving. O
When O
the O
shades O
of O
evening O
began O
falling O
on O
the O
garden, O
the O
sounds O
of O
the O
violin O
and O
singing O
voices O
reached O
him O
indistinctly, O
and O
that O
reminded O
him O
of O
the O
black O
monk. O
Where, O
in O
what O
land O
or O
in O
what O
planet, O
was O
that O
optical O
absurdity O
moving O
now? O
Hardly O
had O
he O
recalled O
the O
legend O
and O
pictured O
in O
his O
imagination O
the O
dark O
apparition O
he O
had O
seen O
in O
the O
rye-field, O
when, O
from O
behind O
a O
pine-tree O
exactly O
opposite, O
there O
came O
out O
noiselessly, O
without O
the O
slightest O
rustle, O
a O
man O
of O
medium O
height O
with O
uncovered O
grey O
head, O
all O
in O
black, O
and O
barefooted O
like O
a O
beggar, O
and O
his O
black O
eyebrows O
stood O
out O
conspicuously O
on O
his O
pale, O
death-like O
face. O
Nodding O
his O
head O
graciously, O
this O
beggar O
or O
pilgrim O
came O
noiselessly O
to O
the O
seat O
and O
sat O
down, O
and O
Kovrin O
recognised O
him O
as O
the O
black O
monk. O
For O
a O
minute O
they O
looked O
at O
one O
another, O
Kovrin O
with O
amazement, O
and O
the Entity
monk Entity
with O
friendliness, O
and, O
just O
as O
before, O
a O
little O
slyness, O
as O
though O
he O
were O
thinking O
something O
to O
himself. O
"But Quotation
you Quotation
are Quotation
a Quotation
mirage," Quotation
said Cue
Kovrin. Entity
"Why Quotation
are Quotation
you Quotation
here Quotation
and Quotation
sitting Quotation
still? Quotation
That Quotation
does Quotation
not Quotation
fit Quotation
in Quotation
with Quotation
the Quotation
legend." Quotation
"That Quotation
does Quotation
not Quotation
matter," Quotation
the Entity
monk Entity
answered Cue
in O
a O
low O
voice, O
not O
immediately O
turning O
his O
face O
towards O
him. Entity
"The Quotation
legend, Quotation
the Quotation
mirage, Quotation
and Quotation
I Quotation
are Quotation
all Quotation
the Quotation
products Quotation
of Quotation
your Quotation

imagination. Quotation
I Quotation
am Quotation
a Quotation
phantom." Quotation
"Then Quotation
you Quotation
don't Quotation
exist?" Quotation
said Cue
Kovrin. Entity
"You Quotation
can Quotation
think Quotation
as Quotation
you Quotation
like," Quotation
said Cue
the Entity
monk, Entity
with O
a O
faint O
smile. O
"I Quotation
exist Quotation
in Quotation
your Quotation
imagination, Quotation
and Quotation
your Quotation
imagination Quotation
is Quotation
part Quotation
of Quotation
nature, Quotation
so Quotation
I Quotation
exist Quotation
in Quotation
nature." Quotation
"You Quotation
have Quotation
a Quotation
very Quotation
old, Quotation
wise, Quotation
and Quotation
extremely Quotation
expressive Quotation
face, Quotation
as Quotation
though Quotation
you Quotation
really Quotation

lived Quotation
more Quotation

said Cue
Kovrin. Entity
"I Quotation
did Quotation
not Quotation
know Quotation
that Quotation
my Quotation
imagination Quotation
was Quotation
capable Quotation
of Quotation
creating Quotation
such Quotation

But Quotation
why Quotation
do Quotation
you Quotation
look Quotation
at Quotation
me Quotation
with Quotation
such Quotation
enthusiasm? Quotation
Do Quotation
you Quotation
like Quotation
me?" Quotation
"Yes, Quotation

"There Quotation

eternal Quotation

said Cue
the Entity
monk. Entity
"Do Quotation
you Quotation
believe Quotation
in Quotation
the Quotation
immortality Quotation

"Yes, Quotation

"And Quotation
what Quotation
is Quotation
the Quotation
object Quotation
of Quotation
eternal Quotation
life?" Quotation
asked Cue
Kovrin. Entity
"As Quotation
of Quotation
all Quotation

enjoyment. Quotation
True Quotation

"If Quotation
only Quotation

it Quotation

you!" Quotation
said Cue
Kovrin, Entity
rubbing O
his O
hands O
with O
satisfaction. O
"I Quotation
am Quotation
very Quotation
glad." Quotation
"But Quotation
I Quotation
know Quotation
that Quotation

you Quotation

away Quotation
I Quotation
shall Quotation
be Quotation

the Quotation
question Quotation
of Quotation
your Quotation

You Quotation
are Quotation
a Quotation
phantom, Quotation
an Quotation

So Quotation
I Quotation
am Quotation
mentally Quotation
deranged, Quotation
not Quotation
normal?" Quotation
"What Quotation
if Quotation
you Quotation
are? Quotation
Why Quotation
trouble Quotation
yourself? Quotation
You Quotation
are Quotation
ill Quotation
because Quotation
you Quotation
have Quotation
overworked Quotation

exhausted Quotation
yourself, Quotation

that Quotation

that Quotation
you Quotation
have Quotation
sacrificed Quotation
your Quotation

the Quotation

"Strange Quotation
that Quotation
you Quotation
repeat Quotation
what Quotation
often Quotation
comes Quotation
into Quotation
my Quotation
mind," Quotation

Kovrin. Entity

The O
monk O
did O
not O
answer. O
Kovrin O
looked O
at O
him O
and O
could O
not O
distinguish O
his O
face. O
His O
features O
grew O
blurred O
and O
misty. O
Then O
the O
monk's Entity
head O
and O
arms O
disappeared; O
his O
body O
seemed O
merged O
into O
the O
seat O
and O
the O
evening O
twilight, O
and O
he O
vanished O
altogether. O
"The Quotation
hallucination Quotation
is Quotation
over," Quotation
said Cue
Kovrin; Entity
and O
he O
laughed. O
"It's Quotation
a Quotation
pity." Quotation
He O
went O
back O
to O
the O
house, O
light-hearted O
and O
happy. O
The O
little O
the O
monk O
had O
said O
to O
him O
had O
flattered, O
not O
his O
vanity, O

his O
whole O
soul, O
his O
whole O
being. O
To O
be O
one O
of O
the O

to O

from O
some O
thousands O

unnecessary O

for O

what O
an O
exalted, O

a O

He O
recalled O

pure, O

he O
remembered O
what O

Tanya O

wearing O

"Are Quotation

what Quotation

wonder, O
glancing O
at O
his Entity
radiant, O
ecstatic O

eyes O
full O

tears. O
"How Quotation
strange Quotation
you Quotation
are, Quotation
Andryusha!" Quotation
"I Quotation

kissed O
both O

went Cue
on: Cue
"I Quotation

Yes? Quotation

"Come," Quotation
said Cue
Tanya, Entity
and O
tried O
to O
laugh O
again, O
but O
the O
laugh O
would O
not O
come, O
and O
patches O
of O
colour O
came O
into O
her O

She O
began O
breathing O
quickly O

walked O
very O
quickly, O

not O
to O
the O

further O
into O
the O

"I Quotation

I Quotation

wringing O
her O

Kovrin Entity
followed O
her Entity

went Cue
on Cue
talking, Cue
with O
the O

She O

aloud: Cue

Learning O
from O
Kovrin O
that O

one O

trying O
to O

his O

His O

trembling, O
his O
neck O
swelled O

turned O
purple, O
he O
ordered O

Tanya, O

was O
feeling, O
shut O
herself O
up O
in O
her O
room, O
and O
cried O
the O
whole O
day. O
In O
the O
hot-houses O
the O
peaches O
and O
plums O
were O
already O
ripe; O
the O
packing O
and O
sending O
off O
of O
these O
tender O
and O
fragile O
goods O
to O
Moscow O
took O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
care, O
work, O
and O
trouble. O
Owing O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
summer O
was O
very O
hot O
and O
dry, O
it O
was O
necessary O
to O
water O
every O
tree, O
and O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
time O
and O
labour O
was O
spent O
on O
doing O
it. O
Numbers O
of O
caterpillars O
made O
their O
appearance, O
which, O
to O
Kovrin's O
disgust, O
the O
labourers O
and O
even O
Yegor O
Semyonitch O
and O
Tanya O
squashed O
with O
their O
fingers. O
In O
spite O
of O
all O
that, O
they O
had O
already O
to O
book O
autumn O
orders O
for O
fruit O
and O
trees, O
and O
to O
carry O
on O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
correspondence. O
And O
at O
the O
very O
busiest O
time, O
when O
no O
one O
seemed O
to O
have O
a O
free O
moment, O
the O
work O
of O
the O
fields O
carried O
off O
more O
than O
half O
their O
labourers O
from O
the O
garden. O
Yegor O
Semyonitch, O
sunburnt, O
exhausted, O
ill-humoured, O
galloped O
from O
the O
fields O
to O
the O
garden O
and O
back O
again; O
cried O
that O
he O
was O
being O
torn O
to O
pieces, O
and O
that O
he O
should O
put O
a O
bullet O
through O
his O
brains. O
Then O
came O
the O
fuss O
and O
worry O
of O
the O
trousseau, O
to O
which O
the O
Pesotskys O
attached O
a O
good O
deal O
of O
importance. O
Every O
one's O
head O
was O
in O
a O
whirl O
from O
the O
snipping O
of O
the O
scissors, O
the O
rattle O
of O
the O
sewing-machine, O
the O
smell O
of O
hot O
irons, O
and O
the O
caprices O
of O
the O
dressmaker, O
a O
huffy O
and O
nervous O
lady. O
And, O
as O
ill-luck O
would O
have O
it, O
visitors O
came O
every O
day, O
who O
had O
to O
be O
entertained, O
fed, O
and O
even O
put O
up O
for O
the O
night. O
But O
all O
this O
hard O
labour O
passed O
unnoticed O
as O
though O
in O
a O
fog. O
Tanya O
felt O
that O
love O
and O
happiness O
had O
taken O
her O
unawares, O
though O
she O
had, O
since O
she O
was O
fourteen, O
for O
some O
reason O
been O
convinced O
that O
Kovrin O
would O
marry O
her O
and O
no O
one O
else. O
She O
was O
bewildered, O
could O
not O
grasp O
it, O
could O
not O
believe O
herself. O
. O
. O
. O
At O
one O
minute O
such O
joy O
would O
swoop O
down O
upon O
her O
that O
she O
longed O
to O
fly O
away O
to O
the O
clouds O
and O
there O
pray O
to O
God, O
at O
another O
moment O
she O
would O
remember O
that O
in O
August O
she O
would O
have O
to O
part O
from O
her O
home O
and O
leave O
her O
father; O
or, O
goodness O
knows O
why, O
the O
idea O
would O
occur O
to O
her O
that O
she O
was O
worthless-- O
insignificant O
and O
unworthy O
of O
a O
great O
man O
like O
Kovrin-- O
and O
she O
would O
go O
to O
her O
room, O
lock O
herself O
in, O
and O
cry O
bitterly O
for O
several O
hours. O
When O
there O
were O
visitors, O
she O
would O
suddenly O
fancy O
that O
Kovrin O
looked O
extraordinarily O
handsome, O
and O
that O
all O
the O
women O
were O
in O
love O
with O
him O
and O
envying O
her, O
and O
her O
soul O
was O
filled O
with O
pride O
and O
rapture, O
as O
though O
she O
had O
vanquished O
the O
whole O
world; O
but O
he O
had O
only O
to O
smile O
politely O
at O
any O
young O
lady O
for O
her O
to O
be O
trembling O
with O
jealousy, O
to O
retreat O
to O
her O
room-- O
and O
tears O
again. O
These O
new O
sensations O
mastered O
her O
completely; O
she O
helped O
her O
father O
mechanically, O
without O
noticing O
peaches, O
caterpillars O
or O
labourers, O
or O
how O
rapidly O
the O
time O
was O
passing. O
It O
was O
almost O
the O
same O
with O
Yegor O
Semyonitch. O
He O
worked O
from O
morning O
till O
night, O
was O
always O
in O
a O
hurry, O
was O
irritable, O
and O
flew O
into O
rages, O
but O
all O
of O
this O
was O
in O
a O
sort O
of O
spellbound O
dream. O
It O
seemed O
as O
though O
there O
were O
two O
men O
in O
him: O
one O
was O
the O
real O
Yegor O
Semyonitch, O
who O
was O
moved O
to O
indignation, O
and O
clutched O
his O
head O
in O
despair O
when O
he O
heard O
of O
some O
irregularity O
from O
Ivan O
Karlovitch O
the O
gardener; O
and O
another-- O
not O
the O
real O
one-- O
who O
seemed O
as O
though O
he Entity
were O
half O
drunk, O
would O
interrupt O
a O
business O
conversation O
at O
half O
a O
word, O
touch O
the Entity
gardener Entity
on O
the O
shoulder, O
and O
begin Cue
muttering: Cue
"Say Quotation
what Quotation
you Quotation
like, Quotation
there Quotation
is Quotation
a Quotation
great Quotation
deal Quotation
in Quotation
blood. Quotation
His Quotation
mother Quotation
was Quotation
a Quotation
wonderful Quotation
woman, Quotation
most Quotation
high-minded Quotation
and Quotation
intelligent. Quotation
It Quotation
was Quotation
a Quotation
pleasure Quotation
to Quotation
look Quotation
at Quotation
her Quotation
good, Quotation
candid, Quotation
pure Quotation
face; Quotation
it Quotation
was Quotation
like Quotation
the Quotation
face Quotation
of Quotation
an Quotation
angel. Quotation
She Quotation
drew Quotation
splendidly, Quotation
wrote Quotation
verses, Quotation
spoke Quotation
five Quotation
foreign Quotation
languages, Quotation
sang. Quotation
. Quotation
. Quotation
. Quotation
Poor Quotation
thing! Quotation
she Quotation
died Quotation
of Quotation
consumption. Quotation
The Quotation
Kingdom Quotation
of Quotation
Heaven Quotation
be Quotation
hers." Quotation
The O
unreal O
Yegor Entity
Semyonitch Entity
sighed, O
and O
after Cue
a Cue
pause Cue
went Cue
on: Cue
"When Quotation
he Quotation
was Quotation
a Quotation
boy Quotation
and Quotation
growing Quotation
up Quotation
in Quotation
my Quotation
house, Quotation
he Quotation
had Quotation
the Quotation
same Quotation
angelic Quotation
face, Quotation
good Quotation
and Quotation
candid. Quotation
The Quotation
way Quotation
he Quotation
looks Quotation
and Quotation
talks Quotation
and Quotation
moves Quotation
is Quotation
as Quotation
soft Quotation
and Quotation
elegant Quotation
as Quotation
his Quotation
mother's. Quotation
And Quotation
his Quotation
intellect! Quotation
We Quotation
were Quotation
always Quotation
struck Quotation
with Quotation
his Quotation
intelligence. Quotation
To Quotation
be Quotation
sure, Quotation
it's Quotation
not Quotation
for Quotation
nothing Quotation
he's Quotation
a Quotation
Master Quotation
of Quotation
Arts! Quotation
It's Quotation
not Quotation
for Quotation
nothing! Quotation
And Quotation
wait Quotation
a Quotation
bit, Quotation
Ivan Quotation
Karlovitch, Quotation
what Quotation
will Quotation
he Quotation
be Quotation
in Quotation
ten Quotation
years' Quotation
time? Quotation
He Quotation
will Quotation
be Quotation
far Quotation
above Quotation
us!" Quotation
But O
at O
this O
point O
the O
real O
Yegor Entity
Semyonitch, Entity
suddenly O
coming O
to O
himself, O
would O
make O
a O
terrible O
face, O
would O
clutch O
his O
head O
and O
cry: Cue
"The Quotation
devils! Quotation
They Quotation
have Quotation
spoilt Quotation
everything! Quotation
They Quotation
have Quotation
ruined Quotation
everything! Quotation
They Quotation
have Quotation
spoilt Quotation
everything! Quotation
The Quotation
garden's Quotation
done Quotation
for, Quotation
the Quotation
garden's Quotation
ruined!" Quotation
Kovrin, O
meanwhile, O
worked O
with O
the O
same O
ardour O
as O
before, O
and O
did O
not O
notice O
the O
general O
commotion. O
Love O
only O
added O
fuel O
to O
the O
flames. O
After O
every O
talk O
with O
Tanya O
he O
went O
to O
his O
room, O
happy O
and O
triumphant, O
took O
up O
his O
book O
or O
his O
manuscript O
with O
the O
same O
passion O
with O
which O
he O
had O
just O
kissed O
Tanya O
and O
told O
her O
of O
his O
love. O
What O
the O
black O
monk O
had O
told O
him O
of O
the O
chosen O
of O
God, O
of O
eternal O
truth, O
of O
the O
brilliant O
future O
of O
mankind O
and O
so O
on, O
gave O
peculiar O
and O
extraordinary O
significance O
to O
his O
work, O
and O
filled O
his O
soul O
with O
pride O
and O
the O
consciousness O
of O
his O
own O
exalted O
consequence. O
Once O
or O
twice O
a O
week, O
in O
the O
park O
or O
in O
the O
house, O
he O
met O
the O
black O
monk O
and O
had O
long O
conversations O
with O
him, O
but O
this O
did O
not O
alarm O
him, O
but, O
on O
the O
contrary, O
delighted O
him, O
as O
he O
was O
now O
firmly O
persuaded O
that O
such O
apparitions O
only O
visited O
the O
elect O
few O
who O
rise O
up O
above O
their O
fellows O
and O
devote O
themselves O
to O
the O
service O
of O
the O
idea. O
One O
day O
the O
monk O
appeared O
at O
dinner-time O
and O
sat O
in O
the O
dining-room O
window. O
Kovrin O
was O
delighted, O
and O
very O
adroitly O
began O
a O
conversation O
with O
Yegor O
Semyonitch O
and O
Tanya O
of O
what O
might O
be O
of O
interest O
to O
the O
monk; O
the O
black-robed O
visitor O
listened O
and O
nodded O
his O
head O
graciously, O
and O
Yegor O
Semyonitch O
and O
Tanya O
listened, O
too, O
and O
smiled O
gaily O
without O
suspecting O
that O
Kovrin O
was O
not O
talking O
to O
them O
but O
to O
his O
hallucination. O
Imperceptibly O
the O
fast O
of O
the O
Assumption O
was O
approaching, O
and O
soon O
after O
came O
the O
wedding, O
which, O
at O
Yegor O
Semyonitch's O
urgent O
desire, O
was O
celebrated O
with O
"a O
flourish"-- O
that O
is, O
with O
senseless O
festivities O
that O
lasted O
for O
two O
whole O
days O
and O
nights. O
Three O
thousand O
roubles' O
worth O
of O
food O
and O
drink O
was O
consumed, O
but O
the O
music O
of O
the O
wretched O
hired O
band, O
the O
noisy O
toasts, O
the O
scurrying O
to O
and O
fro O
of O
the O
footmen, O
the O
uproar O
and O
crowding, O
prevented O
them O
from O
appreciating O
the O
taste O
of O
the O
expensive O
wines O
and O
wonderful O
delicacies O
ordered O
from O
Moscow. O
VII O
One O
long O
winter O
night O
Kovrin O
was O
lying O
in O
bed, O
reading O
a O
French O
novel. O
Poor O
Tanya, O
who O
had O
headaches O
in O
the O
evenings O
from O
living O
in O
town, O
to O
which O
she O
was O
not O
accustomed, O
had O
been O
asleep O
a O
long O
while, O
and, O
from O
time O
to O
time, O
articulated O
some O
incoherent O
phrase O
in O
her O
restless O
dreams. O
It O
struck O
three O
o'clock. O
Kovrin O
put O
out O
the O
light O
and O
lay O
down O
to O
sleep, O
lay O
for O
a O
long O
time O
with O
his O
eyes O
closed, O
but O
could O
not O
get O
to O
sleep O
because, O
as O
he O
fancied, O
the O
room O
was O
very O
hot O
and O
Tanya O
talked O
in O
her O
sleep. O
At O
half-past O
four O
he O
lighted O
the O
candle O
again, O
and O
this O
time O
he Entity
saw O
the O
black O
monk O
sitting O
in O
an O
arm-chair O
near O
the O
bed. O
"Good-morning," Quotation
said Cue
the Entity
monk, Entity
and O
after O
a O
brief O
pause O
he Entity
asked: Cue
"What Quotation
are Quotation
you Quotation
thinking Quotation
of Quotation
now?" Quotation
"Of Quotation
fame," Quotation
answered Cue
Kovrin. Entity
"In Quotation
the Quotation
French Quotation
novel Quotation
I Quotation
have Quotation
just Quotation
been Quotation
reading, Quotation
there Quotation
is Quotation
a Quotation
description Quotation
of Quotation
a Quotation
young Quotation
savant, Quotation
who Quotation
does Quotation
silly Quotation
things Quotation
and Quotation
pines Quotation
away Quotation
through Quotation
worrying Quotation
about Quotation
fame. Quotation
I Quotation
can't Quotation
understand Quotation
such Quotation
anxiety." Quotation
"Because Quotation
you Quotation
are Quotation
wise. Quotation
Your Quotation
attitude Quotation
towards Quotation
fame Quotation
is Quotation
one Quotation
of Quotation
indifference, Quotation
as Quotation
towards Quotation
a Quotation
toy Quotation
which Quotation
no Quotation
longer Quotation
interests Quotation
you." Quotation
"Yes, Quotation
that Quotation
is Quotation
true." Quotation
"Renown Quotation
does Quotation
not Quotation
allure Quotation
you Quotation
now. Quotation
What Quotation
is Quotation
there Quotation
flattering, Quotation
amusing, Quotation
or Quotation
edifying Quotation
in Quotation
their Quotation
carving Quotation
your Quotation
name Quotation
on Quotation
a Quotation
tombstone, Quotation
then Quotation
time Quotation
rubbing Quotation
off Quotation
the Quotation
inscription Quotation
together Quotation
with Quotation
the Quotation
gilding? Quotation
Moreover, Quotation
happily Quotation
there Quotation
are Quotation
too Quotation
many Quotation
of Quotation
you Quotation
for Quotation
the Quotation
weak Quotation
memory Quotation
of Quotation
mankind Quotation
to Quotation
be Quotation
able Quotation
to Quotation
retain Quotation
your Quotation
names." Quotation
"Of Quotation
course," Quotation
assented Cue
Kovrin. Entity
"Besides, Quotation
why Quotation
should Quotation
they Quotation
be Quotation
remembered? Quotation
But Quotation
let Quotation
us Quotation
talk Quotation
of Quotation
something Quotation
else. Quotation
Of Quotation
happiness, Quotation
for Quotation
instance. Quotation
What Quotation
is Quotation
happiness?" Quotation
When O
the O
clock O
struck O
five, O
he Entity
was O
sitting O
on O
the O
bed, O
dangling O
his O
feet O
to O
the O
carpet, O
talking Cue
to O
the Entity
monk: Entity
"In Quotation
ancient Quotation
times Quotation
a Quotation
happy Quotation
man Quotation
grew Quotation
at Quotation
last Quotation
frightened Quotation
of Quotation
his Quotation
happiness Quotation
--it Quotation
was Quotation
so Quotation
great!-- Quotation
and Quotation
to Quotation
propitiate Quotation
the Quotation
gods Quotation
he Quotation
brought Quotation
as Quotation
a Quotation
sacrifice Quotation
his Quotation
favourite Quotation
ring. Quotation
Do Quotation
you Quotation
know, Quotation
I, Quotation
too, Quotation
like Quotation
Polykrates, Quotation
begin Quotation
to Quotation
be Quotation
uneasy Quotation
of Quotation
my Quotation
happiness. Quotation
It Quotation
seems Quotation
strange Quotation
to Quotation
me Quotation
that Quotation
from Quotation
morning Quotation
to Quotation
night Quotation
I Quotation
feel Quotation
nothing Quotation
but Quotation
joy; Quotation
it Quotation
fills Quotation
my Quotation
whole Quotation
being Quotation
and Quotation
smothers Quotation
all Quotation
other Quotation
feelings. Quotation
I Quotation
don't Quotation
know Quotation
what Quotation
sadness, Quotation
grief, Quotation
or Quotation
boredom Quotation
is. Quotation
Here Quotation
I Quotation
am Quotation
not Quotation
asleep; Quotation
I Quotation
suffer Quotation
from Quotation
sleeplessness, Quotation
but Quotation
I Quotation
am Quotation
not Quotation
dull. Quotation
I Quotation
say Quotation
it Quotation
in Quotation
earnest; Quotation
I Quotation
begin Quotation
to Quotation
feel Quotation
perplexed." Quotation
"But Quotation
why?" Quotation
the Entity
monk Entity
asked Cue
in O
wonder. O
"Is Quotation
joy Quotation
a Quotation
supernatural Quotation
feeling? Quotation
Ought Quotation
it Quotation
not Quotation
to Quotation
be Quotation
the Quotation
normal Quotation
state Quotation
of Quotation
man? Quotation
The Quotation
more Quotation
highly Quotation
a Quotation
man Quotation
is Quotation
developed Quotation
on Quotation
the Quotation
intellectual Quotation
and Quotation
moral Quotation
side, Quotation
the Quotation
more Quotation
independent Quotation
he Quotation
is, Quotation
the Quotation
more Quotation
pleasure Quotation
life Quotation
gives Quotation
him. Quotation
Socrates, Quotation
Diogenes, Quotation
and Quotation
Marcus Quotation
Aurelius, Quotation
were Quotation
joyful, Quotation
not Quotation
sorrowful. Quotation
And Quotation
the Quotation
Apostle Quotation
tells Quotation
us: Quotation
'Rejoice Quotation
continually'; Quotation
'Rejoice Quotation
and Quotation
be Quotation
glad.'" Quotation
"But Quotation
will Quotation
the Quotation
gods Quotation
be Quotation
suddenly Quotation
wrathful?" Quotation
Kovrin Entity
jested; Cue
and O
he O
laughed. O
"If Quotation
they Quotation
take Quotation
from Quotation
me Quotation
comfort Quotation
and Quotation
make Quotation
me Quotation
go Quotation
cold Quotation
and Quotation
hungry, Quotation
it Quotation
won't Quotation
be Quotation
very Quotation
much Quotation
to Quotation
my Quotation
taste." Quotation
Meanwhile O
Tanya O
woke O
up O
and O
looked O
with O
amazement O
and O
horror O
at O
her O
husband. O
He O
was O
talking, O
addressing O
the O
arm-chair, O
laughing O
and O
gesticulating; O
his O
eyes O
were O
gleaming, O
and O
there O
was O
something O
strange O
in O
his O
laugh. O
"Andryusha, Quotation
whom Quotation
are Quotation
you Quotation
talking Quotation
to?" Quotation
she Entity
asked, Cue
clutching O
the O
hand O
he Entity
stretched O
out O
to O
the O
monk. O
"Andryusha! Quotation
Whom?" Quotation
"Oh! Quotation
Whom?" Quotation
said Cue
Kovrin Entity
in O
confusion. O
"Why, Quotation
to Quotation
him. Quotation
. Quotation
. Quotation
. Quotation
He Quotation
is Quotation
sitting Quotation
here," Quotation
he Entity
said, Cue
pointing O
to O
the O
black O

"There Quotation

no Quotation

Andryusha, Quotation

Tanya Entity
put O
her O
arm O
round O
her Entity
husband Entity
and O
held O
him O
tight, O
as O
though O
protecting O
him O
from O
the O

and O
put O
her O
hand O
over O
his O
eyes. O
"You Quotation

ill!" Quotation
she Entity
sobbed, Cue
trembling O
all O
over. O
"Forgive Quotation

my Quotation

." Quotation
Her Entity
trembling O
infected O
him, O
too. O
He O
glanced O
once O
more O
at O
the O
arm-chair, O
which O
was O
now O
empty, O
felt O
a O
sudden O
weakness O
in O
his O
arms O
and O
legs, O
was O
frightened, O
and O
began O
dressing. O
"It's Quotation
nothing, Quotation
Tanya; Quotation
it's Quotation
nothing," Quotation
he Entity
muttered, Cue
shivering. O
"I Quotation
really Quotation
am Quotation
not Quotation
quite Quotation
well Quotation
. Quotation
. Quotation
. Quotation
it's Quotation
time Quotation
to Quotation
admit Quotation
that." Quotation
"I Quotation
have Quotation
noticed Quotation
it Quotation
for Quotation
a Quotation
long Quotation
time Quotation
. Quotation
. Quotation
. Quotation
and Quotation
father Quotation
has Quotation
noticed Quotation
it," Quotation
she Entity
said, Cue
trying O
to O
suppress O
her O
sobs. O
"You Quotation
talk Quotation
to Quotation
yourself, Quotation
smile Quotation
somehow Quotation
strangely Quotation
. Quotation
. Quotation
. Quotation
and Quotation
can't Quotation
sleep. Quotation
Oh, Quotation
my Quotation
God, Quotation
my Quotation
God, Quotation
save Quotation
us!" Quotation
she Entity
said Cue
in O
terror. O
"But Quotation
don't Quotation
be Quotation
frightened, Quotation
Andryusha; Quotation
for Quotation
God's Quotation
sake Quotation
don't Quotation
be Quotation
frightened. Quotation
. Quotation
. Quotation
." Quotation
She O
began O
dressing, O
too. O
Only O
now, O
looking O
at O
her, O
Kovrin O
realised O
the O
danger O
of O
his O
position-- O
realised O
the O
meaning O
of O
the O
black O
monk O
and O
his O
conversations O
with O
him. O
It O
was O
clear O
to O
him O
now O
that O
he O
was O
mad. O
Neither O
of O
them O
knew O
why O
they O
dressed O
and O
went O
into O
the O
dining-room: O
she O
in O
front O
and O
he O
following O
her. O
There O
they O
found O
Yegor O
Semyonitch O
standing O
in O
his O
dressing-gown O
and O
with O
a O
candle O
in O
his O
hand. O
He O
was O
staying O
with O
them, O
and O
had O
been O
awakened O
by O
Tanya's O
sobs. O
"Don't Quotation
be Quotation
frightened, Quotation
Andryusha," Quotation
Tanya Entity
was Cue
saying, Cue
shivering O
as O
though O
in O
a O
fever; O
"don't Quotation
be Quotation
frightened. Quotation
. Quotation
. Quotation
. Quotation
Father, Quotation
it Quotation

. Quotation
. Quotation
." Quotation
Kovrin O
was O
too O
much O
agitated O
to O
speak. O
He O
wanted O
to O
say O
to O
his O
father-in-law O
in O
a O
playful O
tone: O
"Congratulate O
me; O
it O
appears O
I O
have O
gone O
out O
of O
my O
mind"; O
but O
he O
could O
only O
move O
his O
lips O
and O
smile O
bitterly. O
At O
nine O
o'clock O
in O
the O
morning O
they O
put O
on O
his O
jacket O
and O
fur O
coat, O
wrapped O
him O
up O
in O
a O
shawl, O
and O
took O
him O
in O
a O
carriage O
to O
a O
doctor. O
VIII O
Summer O
had O
come O
again, O
and O
the O
doctor O
advised O
their O
going O
into O
the O
country. O
Kovrin O
had O
recovered; O
he O
had O
left O
off O
seeing O
the O
black O
monk, O
and O
he O
had O
only O
to O
get O
up O
his O
strength. O
Staying O
at O
his O
father-in-law's, O
he O
drank O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
milk, O
worked O
for O
only O
two O
hours O
out O
of O
the O
twenty-four, O
and O
neither O
smoked O
nor O
drank O
wine. O
On O
the O
evening O
before O
Elijah's O
Day O
they O
had O
an O
evening O
service O
in O
the O
house. O
When O
the O
deacon O
was O
handing O
the O
priest O
the O
censer O
the O
immense O
old O
room O
smelt O
like O
a O
graveyard, O
and O
Kovrin O
felt O
bored. O
He O
went O
out O
into O
the O
garden. O
Without O
noticing O
the O
gorgeous O
flowers, O
he O
walked O
about O
the O
garden, O
sat O
down O
on O
a O
seat, O
then O
strolled O
about O
the O
park; O
reaching O
the O
river, O
he O
went O
down O
and O
then O
stood O
lost O
in O
thought, O
looking O
at O
the O
water. O
The O
sullen O
pines O
with O
their O
shaggy O
roots, O
which O
had O
seen O
him O
a O
year O
before O
so O
young, O
so O
joyful O
and O
confident, O
were O
not O
whispering O
now, O
but O
standing O
mute O
and O
motionless, O
as O
though O
they O
did O
not O
recognise O
him. O
And, O
indeed, O
his O
head O
was O
closely O
cropped, O
his O
beautiful O
long O
hair O
was O
gone, O
his O
step O
was O
lagging, O
his O
face O
was O
fuller O
and O
paler O
than O
last O
summer. O
He O
crossed O
by O
the O
footbridge O
to O
the O
other O
side. O
Where O
the O
year O
before O
there O
had O
been O
rye O
the O
oats O
stood, O
reaped, O
and O
lay O
in O
rows. O
The O
sun O
had O
set O
and O
there O
was O
a O
broad O
stretch O
of O
glowing O
red O
on O
the O
horizon, O
a O
sign O
of O
windy O
weather O
next O
day. O
It O
was O
still. O
Looking O
in O
the O
direction O
from O
which O
the O
year O
before O
the O
black O
monk O
had O
first O
appeared, O
Kovrin O
stood O
for O
twenty O
minutes, O
till O
the O
evening O
glow O
had O
begun O
to O
fade. O
. O
. O
. O
When, O
listless O
and O
dissatisfied, O
he O
returned O
home O
the O
service O
was O
over. O
Yegor O
Semyonitch O
and O
Tanya O
were O
sitting O
on O
the O
steps O
of O
the O
verandah, O
drinking O
tea. O
They O
were O
talking O
of O
something, O
but, O
seeing O
Kovrin, O
ceased O
at O
once, O
and O
he O
concluded O
from O
their O
faces O
that O
their O
talk O
had O
been O
about O
him. O
"I Quotation
believe Quotation
it Quotation
is Quotation
time Quotation
for Quotation
you Quotation
to Quotation
have Quotation
your Quotation
milk," Quotation
Tanya Entity
said Cue
to O
her Entity
husband. Entity
"No, Quotation
it Quotation
is Quotation
not Quotation
time Quotation
yet Quotation
. Quotation
. Quotation
." Quotation
he Entity
said, Cue
sitting O
down O
on O
the O
bottom O
step. O
"Drink Quotation
it Quotation
yourself; Quotation
I Quotation
don't Quotation
want Quotation
it." Quotation
Tanya Entity
exchanged O
a O
troubled O
glance O
with O
her O
father, O
and O
said Cue
in O
a O
guilty O
voice: O
"You Quotation
notice Quotation
yourself Quotation
that Quotation
milk Quotation
does Quotation
you Quotation
good." Quotation
"Yes, Quotation
a Quotation
great Quotation
deal Quotation
of Quotation
good!" Quotation
Kovrin Entity
laughed. Cue
"I Quotation
congratulate Quotation
you: Quotation
I Quotation
have Quotation
gained Quotation
a Quotation
pound Quotation
in Quotation
weight Quotation
since Quotation
Friday." Quotation
He Entity
pressed O
his O
head O
tightly O
in O
his O
hands O
and O
said Cue
miserably: O
"Why, Quotation
why Quotation
have Quotation
you Quotation
cured Quotation
me? Quotation
Preparations Quotation
of Quotation
bromide, Quotation
idleness, Quotation
hot Quotation
baths, Quotation
supervision, Quotation
cowardly Quotation
consternation Quotation
at Quotation
every Quotation
mouthful, Quotation
at Quotation
every Quotation
step-- Quotation
all Quotation
this Quotation
will Quotation
reduce Quotation
me Quotation
at Quotation
last Quotation
to Quotation
idiocy. Quotation
I Quotation
went Quotation
out Quotation
of Quotation
my Quotation
mind, Quotation
I Quotation
had Quotation
megalomania; Quotation
but Quotation
then Quotation
I Quotation
was Quotation
cheerful, Quotation
confident, Quotation
and Quotation
even Quotation
happy; Quotation
I Quotation
was Quotation
interesting Quotation
and Quotation
original. Quotation
Now Quotation
I Quotation
have Quotation
become Quotation
more Quotation
sensible Quotation
and Quotation
stolid, Quotation
but Quotation
I Quotation
am Quotation
just Quotation
like Quotation
every Quotation
one Quotation
else: Quotation
I Quotation
am-- Quotation
mediocrity; Quotation
I Quotation
am Quotation
weary Quotation
of Quotation
life. Quotation
. Quotation
. Quotation
. Quotation
Oh, Quotation
how Quotation
cruelly Quotation
you Quotation
have Quotation
treated Quotation
me! Quotation
. Quotation
. Quotation
. Quotation
I Quotation
saw Quotation
hallucinations, Quotation
but Quotation
what Quotation
harm Quotation
did Quotation
that Quotation
do Quotation
to Quotation
any Quotation
one? Quotation
I Quotation
ask, Quotation
what Quotation
harm Quotation
did Quotation
that Quotation
do Quotation
any Quotation
one?" Quotation
"Goodness Quotation
knows Quotation
what Quotation
you Quotation
are Quotation
saying!" Quotation
sighed Cue
Yegor Entity
Semyonitch. Entity
"It's Quotation
positively Quotation
wearisome Quotation
to Quotation
listen Quotation
to Quotation
it." Quotation
"Then Quotation
don't Quotation
listen." Quotation
The O
presence O
of O
other O
people, O
especially O
Yegor O
Semyonitch, O
irritated O
Kovrin Entity
now; O
he O
answered O
him O
drily, O
coldly, O
and O
even O
rudely, O
never O
looked O
at O
him O
but O
with O
irony O
and O
hatred, O
while O
Yegor O
Semyonitch O
was O
overcome O
with O
confusion O
and O
cleared O
his O
throat O
guiltily, O
though O
he O
was O
not O
conscious O
of O
any O
fault O
in O
himself. O
At O
a O
loss O
to O
understand O
why O
their O
charming O
and O
affectionate O
relations O
had O
changed O
so O
abruptly, O
Tanya O
huddled O
up O
to O
her O
father O
and O
looked O
anxiously O
in O
his O
face; O
she O
wanted O
to O
understand O
and O
could O
not O
understand, O
and O
all O
that O
was O
clear O
to O
her O
was O
that O
their O
relations O
were O
growing O
worse O
and O
worse O
every O
day, O
that O
of O
late O
her O
father O
had O
begun O
to O
look O
much O
older, O
and O
her O
husband O
had O
grown O
irritable, O
capricious, O
quarrelsome O
and O
uninteresting. O
She O
could O
not O
laugh O
or O
sing; O
at O
dinner O
she O
ate O
nothing; O
did O
not O
sleep O
for O
nights O
together, O
expecting O
something O
awful, O
and O
was O
so O
worn O
out O
that O
on O
one O
occasion O
she O
lay O
in O
a O
dead O
faint O
from O
dinner-time O
till O
evening. O
During O
the O
service O
she O
thought O
her O
father O
was O
crying, O
and O
now O
while O
the O
three O
of O
them O
were O
sitting O
together O
on O
the O
terrace O
she Entity
made O
an O
effort O
not O
to O
think O
of O
it. O
"How Quotation
fortunate Quotation
Buddha, Quotation
Mahomed, Quotation
and Quotation
Shakespeare Quotation
were Quotation
that Quotation
their Quotation
kind Quotation
relations Quotation
and Quotation
doctors Quotation
did Quotation
not Quotation
cure Quotation
them Quotation
of Quotation
their Quotation
ecstasy Quotation
and Quotation
their Quotation
inspiration," Quotation
said Cue
Kovrin. Entity
"If Quotation
Mahomed Quotation
had Quotation
taken Quotation
bromide Quotation
for Quotation
his Quotation
nerves, Quotation
had Quotation
worked Quotation
only Quotation
two Quotation
hours Quotation
out Quotation
of Quotation
the Quotation
twenty-four, Quotation
and Quotation
had Quotation
drunk Quotation
milk, Quotation
that Quotation
remarkable Quotation
man Quotation
would Quotation
have Quotation
left Quotation
no Quotation
more Quotation
trace Quotation
after Quotation
him Quotation
than Quotation
his Quotation
dog. Quotation
Doctors Quotation
and Quotation
kind Quotation
relations Quotation
will Quotation
succeed Quotation
in Quotation
stupefying Quotation
mankind, Quotation
in Quotation
making Quotation
mediocrity Quotation
pass Quotation
for Quotation
genius Quotation
and Quotation
in Quotation
bringing Quotation
civilisation Quotation
to Quotation
ruin. Quotation
If Quotation
only Quotation
you Quotation
knew," Quotation
Kovrin Entity
said Cue
with O
annoyance, O
"how Quotation
grateful Quotation
I Quotation
am Quotation
to Quotation
you." Quotation
He O
felt O
intense O
irritation, O
and O
to O
avoid O
saying O
too O
much, O
he O
got O
up O
quickly O
and O
went O
into O
the O
house. O
It O
was O
still, O
and O
the O
fragrance O
of O
the O
tobacco O
plant O
and O
the O
marvel O
of O
Peru O
floated O
in O
at O
the O
open O
window. O
The O
moonlight O
lay O
in O
green O
patches O
on O
the O
floor O
and O
on O
the O
piano O
in O
the O
big O
dark O
dining-room. O
Kovrin O
remembered O
the O
raptures O
of O
the O
previous O
summer O
when O
there O
had O
been O
the O
same O
scent O
of O
the O
marvel O
of O
Peru O
and O
the O
moon O
had O
shone O
in O
at O
the O
window. O
To O
bring O
back O
the O
mood O
of O
last O
year O
he O
went O
quickly O
to O
his O
study, O
lighted O
a O
strong O
cigar, O
and O
told O
the O
footman O
to O
bring O
him O
some O
wine. O
But O
the O
cigar O
left O
a O
bitter O
and O
disgusting O
taste O
in O
his O
mouth, O
and O
the O
wine O
had O
not O
the O
same O
flavour O
as O
it O
had O
the O
year O
before. O
And O
so O
great O
is O
the O
effect O
of O
giving O
up O
a O
habit, O
the O
cigar O
and O
the O
two O
gulps O
of O
wine O
made O
him O
giddy, O
and O
brought O
on O
palpitations O
of O
the O
heart, O
so O
that O
he O
was O
obliged O
to O
take O
bromide. O
Before O
going O
to O
bed, O
Tanya Entity
said Cue
to O
him: Entity
"Father Quotation
adores Quotation
you. Quotation
You Quotation
are Quotation
cross Quotation
with Quotation
him Quotation
about Quotation
something, Quotation
and Quotation
it Quotation
is Quotation
killing Quotation
him. Quotation
Look Quotation
at Quotation
him; Quotation
he Quotation
is Quotation
ageing, Quotation
not Quotation
from Quotation
day Quotation
to Quotation
day, Quotation
but Quotation
from Quotation
hour Quotation
to Quotation
hour. Quotation
I Quotation
entreat Quotation
you, Quotation
Andryusha, Quotation
for Quotation
God's Quotation
sake, Quotation
for Quotation

"I Quotation
can't, Quotation
I Quotation
don't Quotation
want Quotation
to." Quotation
"But Quotation
why?" Quotation
asked Cue
Tanya, Entity
beginning O
to O
tremble O
all O
over. O
"Explain Quotation
why." Quotation
"Because Quotation
he Quotation
is Quotation
antipathetic Quotation
to Quotation
me, Quotation
that's Quotation
all," Quotation
said Cue
Kovrin Entity
carelessly; O
and O
he O
shrugged O
his O
shoulders. O
"But Quotation
we Quotation
won't Quotation
talk Quotation
about Quotation
him: Quotation
he Quotation
is Quotation
your Quotation
father." Quotation
"I Quotation
can't Quotation
understand, Quotation
I Quotation
can't," Quotation
said Cue
Tanya, Entity
pressing O
her O
hands O
to O
her O
temples O
and O
staring O
at O
a O
fixed O
point. O
"Something Quotation
incomprehensible, Quotation
awful, Quotation
is Quotation
going Quotation
on Quotation
in Quotation
the Quotation

Come, Quotation
come, Quotation
don't Quotation
be Quotation
angry, Quotation
don't Quotation
be Quotation
angry," Quotation
she Entity
went Cue
on, Cue
kissing O
his Entity
hands, O
frightened O
of O
her O
own O
words. O
"You Quotation
are Quotation
clever, Quotation
kind, Quotation
noble. Quotation
You Quotation
will Quotation
be Quotation
just Quotation

He Quotation

so Quotation
good." Quotation
"He Quotation

not Quotation
good; Quotation

is Quotation
just Quotation
good-natured. Quotation
Burlesque Quotation
old Quotation
uncles Quotation

your Quotation

with Quotation
well-fed, Quotation
good-natured Quotation

the Quotation

What Quotation
disgusts Quotation
me Quotation
most Quotation
of Quotation
all Quotation

their Quotation
being Quotation

well-fed, Quotation

that Quotation
purely Quotation

purely Quotation
hoggish Quotation

Tanya O
sat O
down O
on O
the O
bed O
and O
laid O
her O
head O
on O
the O
pillow. O
"This Quotation
is Quotation
torture," Quotation
she Entity
said, Cue
and O
from O
her O
voice O
it O
was O
evident O
that O
she O
was O
utterly O
exhausted, O
and O
that O
it O
was O
hard O
for O
her O
to O
speak. O
"Not Quotation
one Quotation
moment Quotation
of Quotation
peace Quotation
since Quotation

winter. Quotation

Why, Quotation
it's Quotation

I Quotation
am Quotation
Herod, Quotation

you Quotation

the Quotation
innocents. Quotation
Of Quotation
course." Quotation
His Entity
face O
seemed O
to O
Tanya O
ugly O
and O
unpleasant. O
Hatred O
and O
an O
ironical O
expression O
did O
not O
suit O
him. O
And, O
indeed, O
she O
had O
noticed O
before O
that O
there O
was O
something O
lacking O
in O
his O
face, O
as O
though O
ever O
since O
his O
hair O
had O
been O
cut O
his O
face O
had O
changed, O
too. O
She O
wanted O
to O
say O
something O
wounding O
to O
him, O
but O
immediately O
she O
caught O
herself O
in O
this O
antagonistic O
feeling, O
she O
was O
frightened O
and O
went O
out O

IX O
Kovrin O
received O
a O
professorship O
at O
the O
University. O
The O
inaugural O
address O
was O
fixed O
for O
the O
second O
of O
December, O
and O
a O
notice O
to O
that O
effect O
was O
hung O
up O
in O
the O
corridor O
at O
the O
University. O
But O
on O
the O
day O
appointed O
he O
informed O
the O
students' O
inspector, O
by O
telegram, O
that O
he O
was O
prevented O
by O
illness O
from O
giving O
the O
lecture. O
He O
had O
hæmorrhage O
from O
the O
throat. O
He O
was O
often O
spitting O
blood, O
but O
it O
happened O
two O
or O
three O
times O
a O
month O
that O
there O
was O
a O
considerable O
loss O
of O
blood, O
and O
then O
he O
grew O
extremely O
weak O
and O
sank O
into O
a O
drowsy O
condition. O
This O
illness O
did O
not O
particularly O
frighten O
him, O
as O
he O
knew O
that O
his O
mother O
had O
lived O
for O
ten O
years O
or O
longer O
suffering O
from O
the O
same O
disease, O
and O
the O
doctors O
assured O
him O
that O
there O
was O
no O
danger, O
and O
had O
only O
advised O
him O
to O
avoid O
excitement, O
to O
lead O
a O
regular O
life, O
and O
to O
speak O
as O
little O
as O
possible. O
In O
January O
again O
his O
lecture O
did O
not O
take O
place O
owing O
to O
the O
same O
reason, O
and O
in O
February O
it O
was O
too O
late O
to O
begin O
the O
course. O
It O
had O
to O
be O
postponed O
to O
the O
following O
year. O
By O
now O
he O
was O
living O
not O
with O
Tanya, O
but O
with O
another O
woman, O
who O
was O
two O
years O
older O
than O
he O
was, O
and O
who O
looked O
after O
him O
as O
though O
he O
were O
a O
baby. O
He O
was O
in O
a O
calm O
and O
tranquil O
state O
of O
mind; O
he O
readily O
gave O
in O
to O
her, O
and O
when O
Varvara O
Nikolaevna-- O
that O
was O
the O
name O
of O
his O
friend-- O
decided O
to O
take O
him O
to O
the O
Crimea, O
he O
agreed, O
though O
he O
had O
a O
presentiment O
that O
no O
good O
would O
come O
of O
the O
trip. O
They O
reached O
Sevastopol O
in O
the O
evening O
and O
stopped O
at O
an O
hotel O
to O
rest O
and O
go O
on O
the O
next O
day O
to O
Yalta. O
They O
were O
both O
exhausted O
by O
the O
journey. O
Varvara O
Nikolaevna O
had O
some O
tea, O
went O
to O
bed O
and O
was O
soon O
asleep. O
But O
Kovrin O
did O
not O
go O
to O
bed. O
An O
hour O
before O
starting O
for O
the O
station, O
he O
had O
received O
a O
letter O
from O
Tanya, O
and O
had O
not O
brought O
himself O
to O
open O
it, O
and O
now O
it O
was O
lying O
in O
his O
coat O
pocket, O
and O
the O
thought O
of O
it O
excited O
him O
disagreeably. O
At O
the O
bottom O
of O
his O
heart O
he O
genuinely O
considered O
now O
that O
his O
marriage O
to O
Tanya O
had O
been O
a O
mistake. O
He O
was O
glad O
that O
their O
separation O
was O
final, O
and O
the O
thought O
of O
that O
woman O
who O
in O
the O
end O
had O
turned O
into O
a O
living O
relic, O
still O
walking O
about O
though O
everything O
seemed O
dead O
in O
her O
except O
her O
big, O
staring, O
intelligent O
eyes-- O
the O
thought O
of O
her O
roused O
in O
him O
nothing O
but O
pity O
and O
disgust O
with O
himself. O
The O
handwriting O
on O
the O
envelope O
reminded O
him O
how O
cruel O
and O
unjust O
he O
had O
been O
two O
years O
before, O
how O
he O
had O
worked O
off O
his O
anger O
at O
his O
spiritual O
emptiness, O
his O
boredom, O
his O
loneliness, O
and O
his O
dissatisfaction O
with O
life O
by O
revenging O
himself O
on O
people O
in O
no O
way O
to O
blame. O
He O
remembered, O
also, O
how O
he O
had O
torn O
up O
his O
dissertation O
and O
all O
the O
articles O
he O
had O
written O
during O
his O
illness, O
and O
how O
he O
had O
thrown O
them O
out O
of O
window, O
and O
the O
bits O
of O
paper O
had O
fluttered O
in O
the O
wind O
and O
caught O
on O
the O
trees O
and O
flowers. O
In O
every O
line O
of O
them O
he O
saw O
strange, O
utterly O
groundless O
pretension, O
shallow O
defiance, O
arrogance, O
megalomania; O
and O
they O
made O
him O
feel O
as O
though O
he O
were O
reading O
a O
description O
of O
his O
vices. O
But O
when O
the O
last O
manuscript O
had O
been O
torn O
up O
and O
sent O
flying O
out O
of O
window, O
he O
felt, O
for O
some O
reason, O
suddenly O
bitter O
and O
angry; O
he O
went O
to O
his O
wife O
and O
said O
a O
great O
many O
unpleasant O
things O
to O
her. O
My O
God, O
how O
he O
had O
tormented O
her! O
One O
day, O
wanting O
to O
cause O
her O
pain, O
he Entity
told Cue
her Entity
that Quotation
her Quotation
father Quotation
had Quotation
played Quotation
a Quotation
very Quotation
unattractive Quotation
part Quotation
in Quotation
their Quotation
romance, Quotation
that Quotation
he Quotation
had Quotation
asked Quotation
him Quotation
to Quotation
marry Quotation
her. Quotation
Yegor O
Semyonitch O
accidentally O
overheard O
this, O
ran O
into O
the O
room, O
and, O
in O
his O
despair, O
could O
not O
utter O
a O
word, O
could O
only O
stamp O
and O
make O
a O
strange, O
bellowing O
sound O
as O
though O
he O
had O
lost O
the O
power O
of O
speech, O
and O
Tanya, O
looking O
at O
her O
father, O
had O
uttered O
a O
heart-rending O
shriek O
and O
had O
fallen O
into O
a O
swoon. O
It O
was O
hideous. O
All O
this O
came O
back O
into O
his O
memory O
as O
he O
looked O
at O
the O
familiar O
writing. O
Kovrin O
went O
out O
on O
to O
the O
balcony; O
it O
was O
still O
warm O
weather O
and O
there O
was O
a O
smell O
of O
the O
sea. O
The O
wonderful O
bay O
reflected O
the O
moonshine O
and O
the O
lights, O
and O
was O
of O
a O
colour O
for O
which O
it O
was O
difficult O
to O
find O
a O
name. O
It O
was O
a O
soft O
and O
tender O
blending O
of O
dark O
blue O
and O
green; O
in O
places O
the O
water O
was O
like O
blue O
vitriol, O
and O
in O
places O
it O
seemed O
as O
though O
the O
moonlight O
were O
liquefied O
and O
filling O
the O
bay O
instead O
of O
water. O
And O
what O
harmony O
of O
colours, O
what O
an O
atmosphere O
of O
peace, O
calm, O
and O
sublimity! O
In O
the O
lower O
storey O
under O
the O
balcony O
the O
windows O
were O
probably O
open, O
for O
women's O
voices O
and O
laughter O
could O
be O
heard O
distinctly. O
Apparently O
there O
was O
an O
evening O
party. O
Kovrin O
made O
an O
effort, O
tore O
open O
the O
envelope, O
and, O
going O
back O
into O
his O
room, O
read: O
"My O
father O
is O
just O
dead. O
I O
owe O
that O
to O
you, O
for O
you O
have O
killed O
him. O
Our O
garden O
is O
being O
ruined; O
strangers O
are O
managing O
it O
already O
--that O
is, O
the O
very O
thing O
is O
happening O
that O
poor O
father O
dreaded. O
That, O
too, O
I O
owe O
to O
you. O
I O
hate O
you O
with O
my O
whole O
soul, O
and O
I O
hope O
you O
may O
soon O
perish. O
Oh, O
how O
wretched O
I O
am! O
Insufferable O
anguish O
is O
burning O
my O
soul. O
. O
. O
. O
My O
curses O
on O
you. O
I O
took O
you O
for O
an O
extraordinary O
man, O
a O
genius; O
I O
loved O
you, O
and O
you O
have O
turned O
out O
a O
madman. O
. O
. O
." O
Kovrin O
could O
read O
no O
more, O
he O
tore O
up O
the O
letter O
and O
threw O
it O
away. O
He O
was O
overcome O
by O
an O
uneasiness O
that O
was O
akin O
to O
terror. O
Varvara O
Nikolaevna O
was O
asleep O
behind O
the O
screen, O
and O
he O
could O
hear O
her O
breathing. O
From O
the O
lower O
storey O
came O
the O
sounds O
of O
laughter O
and O
women's O
voices, O
but O
he O
felt O
as O
though O
in O
the O
whole O
hotel O
there O
were O
no O
living O
soul O
but O
him. O
Because O
Tanya, O
unhappy, O
broken O
by O
sorrow, O
had O
cursed O
him O
in O
her O
letter O
and O
hoped O
for O
his O
perdition, O
he O
felt O
eerie O
and O
kept O
glancing O
hurriedly O
at O
the O
door, O
as O
though O
he O
were O
afraid O
that O
the O
uncomprehended O
force O
which O
two O
years O
before O
had O
wrought O
such O
havoc O
in O
his O
life O
and O
in O
the O
life O
of O
those O
near O
him O
might O
come O
into O
the O
room O
and O
master O
him O
once O
more. O
He O
knew O
by O
experience O
that O
when O
his O
nerves O
were O
out O
of O
hand O
the O
best O
thing O
for O
him O
to O
do O
was O
to O
work. O
He O
must O
sit O
down O
to O
the O
table O
and O
force O
himself, O
at O
all O
costs, O
to O
concentrate O
his O
mind O
on O
some O
one O
thought. O
He O
took O
from O
his O
red O
portfolio O
a O
manuscript O
containing O
a O
sketch O
of O
a O
small O
work O
of O
the O
nature O
of O
a O
compilation, O
which O
he O
had O
planned O
in O
case O
he O
should O
find O
it O
dull O
in O
the O
Crimea O
without O
work. O
He O
sat O
down O
to O
the O
table O
and O
began O
working O
at O
this O
plan, O
and O
it O
seemed O
to O
him O
that O
his O
calm, O
peaceful, O
indifferent O
mood O
was O
coming O
back. O
The O
manuscript O
with O
the O
sketch O
even O
led O
him O
to O
meditation O
on O
the O
vanity O
of O
the O
world. O
He O
thought O
how O
much O
life O
exacts O
for O
the O
worthless O
or O
very O
commonplace O
blessings O
it O
can O
give O
a O
man. O
For O
instance, O
to O
gain, O
before O
forty, O
a O
university O
chair, O
to O
be O
an O
ordinary O
professor, O
to O
expound O
ordinary O
and O
second-hand O
thoughts O
in O
dull, O
heavy, O
insipid O
language-- O
in O
fact, O
to O
gain O
the O
position O
of O
a O
mediocre O
learned O
man, O
he, O
Kovrin, O
had O
had O
to O
study O
for O
fifteen O
years, O
to O
work O
day O
and O
night, O
to O
endure O
a O
terrible O
mental O
illness, O
to O
experience O
an O
unhappy O
marriage, O
and O
to O
do O
a O
great O
number O
of O
stupid O
and O
unjust O
things O
which O
it O
would O
have O
been O
pleasant O
not O
to O
remember. O
Kovrin O
recognised O
clearly, O
now, O
that O
he O
was O
a O
mediocrity, O
and O
readily O
resigned O
himself O
to O
it, O
as O
he O
considered O
that O
every O
man O
ought O
to O
be O
satisfied O
with O
what O
he O
is. O
The O
plan O
of O
the O
volume O
would O
have O
soothed O
him O
completely, O
but O
the O
torn O
letter O
showed O
white O
on O
the O
floor O
and O
prevented O
him O
from O
concentrating O
his O
attention. O
He O
got O
up O
from O
the O
table, O
picked O
up O
the O
pieces O
of O
the O
letter O
and O
threw O
them O
out O
of O
window, O
but O
there O
was O
a O
light O
wind O
blowing O
from O
the O
sea, O
and O
the O
bits O
of O
paper O
were O
scattered O
on O
the O
windowsill. O
Again O
he O
was O
overcome O
by O
uneasiness O
akin O
to O
terror, O
and O
he O
felt O
as O
though O
in O
the O
whole O
hotel O
there O
were O
no O
living O
soul O
but O
himself. O
. O
. O
. O
He O
went O
out O
on O
the O
balcony. O
The O
bay, O
like O
a O
living O
thing, O
looked O
at O
him O
with O
its O
multitude O
of O
light O
blue, O
dark O
blue, O
turquoise O
and O
fiery O
eyes, O
and O
seemed O
beckoning O
to O
him. O
And O
it O
really O
was O
hot O
and O
oppressive, O
and O
it O
would O
not O
have O
been O
amiss O
to O
have O
a O
bathe. O
Suddenly O
in O
the O
lower O
storey O
under O
the O
balcony O
a O
violin O
began O
playing, O
and O
two O
soft O
feminine O
voices O
began O
singing. O
It O
was O
something O
familiar. O
The O
song O
was O
about O
a O
maiden, O
full O
of O
sick O
fancies, O
who O
heard O
one O
night O
in O
her O
garden O
mysterious O
sounds, O
so O
strange O
and O
lovely O
that O
she O
was O
obliged O
to O
recognise O
them O
as O
a O
holy O
harmony O
which O
is O
unintelligible O
to O
us O
mortals, O
and O
so O
flies O
back O
to O
heaven O
. O
. O
. O
. O
Kovrin O
caught O
his O
breath O
and O
there O
was O
a O
pang O
of O
sadness O
at O
his O
heart, O
and O
a O
thrill O
of O
the O
sweet, O
exquisite O
delight O
he O
had O
so O
long O
forgotten O
began O
to O
stir O
in O
his O
breast. O
A O
tall O
black O
column, O
like O
a O
whirlwind O
or O
a O
waterspout, O
appeared O
on O
the O
further O
side O
of O
the O
bay. O
It O
moved O
with O
fearful O
rapidity O
across O
the O
bay, O
towards O
the O
hotel, O
growing O
smaller O
and O
darker O
as O
it O
came, O
and O
Kovrin O
only O
just O
had O
time O
to O
get O
out O
of O
the O
way O
to O
let O
it O
pass O
. O
. O
. O
. O
The O
monk O
with O
bare O
grey O
head, O
black O
eyebrows, O
barefoot, O
his O
arms O
crossed O
over O
his O
breast, O
floated O
by O
him, O
and O
stood O
still O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
room. O
"Why Quotation
did Quotation
you Quotation
not Quotation
believe Quotation
me?" Quotation
he Entity
asked Cue
reproachfully, O
looking O
affectionately O
at O
Kovrin. Entity
"If Quotation
you Quotation
had Quotation
believed Quotation
me Quotation
then, Quotation
that Quotation
you Quotation
were Quotation
a Quotation
genius, Quotation
you Quotation
would Quotation
not Quotation
have Quotation
spent Quotation
these Quotation
two Quotation
years Quotation
so Quotation
gloomily Quotation
and Quotation
so Quotation
wretchedly." Quotation
Kovrin O
already O
believed O
that O
he O
was O
one O
of O
God's O
chosen O
and O
a O
genius; O
he O
vividly O
recalled O
his O
conversations O
with O
the O
monk O
in O
the O
past O
and O
tried O
to O
speak, O
but O
the O
blood O
flowed O
from O
his O
throat O
on O
to O
his O
breast, O
and O
not O
knowing O
what O
he O
was O
doing, O
he O
passed O
his O
hands O
over O
his O
breast, O
and O
his O
cuffs O
were O
soaked O
with O
blood. O
He O
tried O
to O
call O
Varvara O
Nikolaevna, O
who O
was O
asleep O
behind O
the O
screen; O
he Entity
made Cue
an Cue
effort Cue
and Cue
said: Cue
"Tanya!" Quotation
He Entity
fell O
on O
the O
floor, O
and O
propping O
himself O
on O
his O
arms, O
called Cue
again: Cue
"Tanya!" Quotation
He O
called O
Tanya, Entity
called O
to O
the O
great O
garden O
with O
the O
gorgeous O
flowers O
sprinkled O
with O
dew, O
called O
to O
the O
park, O
the O
pines O
with O
their O
shaggy O
roots, O
the O
rye-field, O
his O
marvellous O
learning, O
his O
youth, O
courage, O
joy-- O
called O
to O
life, O
which O
was O
so O
lovely. O
He O
saw O
on O
the O
floor O
near O
his O
face O
a O
great O
pool O
of O
blood, O
and O
was O
too O
weak O
to O
utter O
a O
word, O
but O
an O
unspeakable, O
infinite O
happiness O
flooded O
his O
whole O
being. O
Below, O
under O
the O
balcony, O
they O
were O
playing O
the O
serenade, O
and O
the Entity
black Entity
monk Entity
whispered Cue
to O
him Entity
that Quotation
he Quotation
was Quotation
a Quotation
genius, Quotation
and Quotation
that Quotation
he Quotation
was Quotation
dying Quotation
only Quotation
because Quotation
his Quotation
frail Quotation
human Quotation
body Quotation
had Quotation
lost Quotation
its Quotation
balance Quotation
and Quotation
could Quotation
no Quotation
longer Quotation
serve Quotation
as Quotation
the Quotation
mortal Quotation
garb Quotation
of Quotation
genius. Quotation
When O
Varvara O
Nikolaevna O
woke O
up O
and O
came O
out O
from O
behind O
the O
screen, O
Kovrin O
was O
dead, O
and O
a O
blissful O
smile O
was O
set O
upon O
his O
face. O

in O

a O

of O

without O

one O
travels O
in O
Russia O
nowadays, O
except O
merchant's O
clerks, O
dealers O
and O
the O
less O
well-to-do O
among O
priests, O
drove O
out O
of O
N., O
the O
principal O
town O
of O
the O
province O
of O
Z., O
and O
rumbled O
noisily O
along O
the O
posting-track. O
It O
rattled O
and O
creaked O
at O
every O
movement; O
the O
pail, O
hanging O
on O
behind, O
chimed O
in O
gruffly, O
and O
from O
these O
sounds O
alone O
and O
from O
the O
wretched O
rags O
of O
leather O
hanging O
loose O
about O
its O
peeling O
body O
one O
could O
judge O
of O
its O
decrepit O
age O
and O
readiness O
to O
drop O
to O
pieces. O
Two O
of O
the O
inhabitants O
of O
N. O
were O
sitting O
in O
the O
chaise; O
they O
were O
a O
merchant O
of O
N. O
called O
Ivan O
Ivanitch O
Kuzmitchov, O
a O
man O
with O
a O
shaven O
face O
wearing O
glasses O
and O
a O
straw O
hat, O
more O
like O
a O
government O
clerk O
than O
a O
merchant, O
and O
Father O
Christopher O
Sireysky, O
the O
priest O
of O
the O
Church O
of O
St. O
Nikolay O
at O
N., O
a O
little O
old O
man O
with O
long O
hair, O
in O
a O
grey O
canvas O
cassock, O
a O
wide-brimmed O
top-hat O
and O
a O
coloured O
embroidered O
girdle. O
The O
former O
was O
absorbed O
in O
thought, O
and O
kept O
tossing O
his O
head O
to O
shake O
off O
drowsiness; O
in O
his O
countenance O
an O
habitual O
business-like O
reserve O
was O
struggling O
with O
the O
genial O
expression O
of O
a O
man O
who O
has O
just O
said O
good-bye O
to O
his O
relatives O
and O
has O
had O
a O
good O
drink O
at O
parting. O
The O
latter O
gazed O
with O
moist O
eyes O
wonderingly O
at O
God's O
world, O
and O
his O
smile O
was O
so O
broad O
that O
it O
seemed O
to O
embrace O
even O
the O
brim O
of O
his O
hat; O
his O
face O
was O
red O
and O
looked O
frozen. O
Both O
of O
them, O
Father O
Christopher O
as O
well O
as O
Kuzmitchov, O
were O
going O
to O
sell O
wool. O
At O
parting O
with O
their O
families O
they O
had O
just O
eaten O
heartily O
of O
pastry O
puffs O
and O
cream, O
and O
although O
it O
was O
so O
early O
in O
the O
morning O
had O
had O
a O
glass O
or O
two. O
. O
. O
. O
Both O
were O
in O
the O
best O
of O
humours. O
Apart O
from O
the O
two O
persons O
described O
above O
and O
the O
coachman O
Deniska, O
who O
lashed O
the O
pair O
of O
frisky O
bay O
horses, O
there O
was O
another O
figure O
in O
the O
chaise O
-- O
a O
boy O
of O
nine O
with O
a O
sunburnt O
face, O
wet O
with O
tears. O
This O
was O
Yegorushka, O
Kuzmitchov's O
nephew. O
With O
the O
sanction O
of O
his O
uncle O
and O
the O
blessing O
of O
Father O
Christopher, O
he O
was O
now O
on O
his O
way O
to O
go O
to O
school. O
His O
mother, O
Olga O
Ivanovna, O
the O
widow O
of O
a O
collegiate O
secretary, O
and O
Kuzmitchov's O
sister, O
who O
was O
fond O
of O
educated O
people O
and O
refined O
society, O
had O
entreated O
her O
brother O
to O
take O
Yegorushka O
with O
him O
when O
he O
went O
to O
sell O
wool O
and O
to O
put O
him O
to O
school; O
and O
now O
the O
boy O
was O
sitting O
on O
the O
box O
beside O
the O
coachman O
Deniska, O
holding O
on O
to O
his O
elbow O
to O
keep O
from O
falling O
off, O
and O
dancing O
up O
and O
down O
like O
a O
kettle O
on O
the O
hob, O
with O
no O
notion O
where O
he O
was O
going O
or O
what O
he O
was O
going O
for. O
The O
rapid O
motion O
through O
the O
air O
blew O
out O
his O
red O
shirt O
like O
a O
balloon O
on O
his O
back O
and O
made O
his O
new O
hat O
with O
a O
peacock's O
feather O
in O
it, O
like O
a O
coachman's, O
keep O
slipping O
on O
to O
the O
back O
of O
his O
head. O
He O
felt O
himself O
an O
intensely O
unfortunate O
person, O
and O
had O
an O
inclination O
to O
cry. O
When O
the O
chaise O
drove O
past O
the O
prison, O
Yegorushka O
glanced O
at O
the O
sentinels O
pacing O
slowly O
by O
the O
high O
white O
walls, O
at O
the O
little O
barred O
windows, O
at O
the O
cross O
shining O
on O
the O
roof, O
and O
remembered O
how O
the O
week O
before, O
on O
the O
day O
of O
the O
Holy O
Mother O
of O
Kazan, O
he O
had O
been O
with O
his O
mother O
to O
the O
prison O
church O
for O
the O
Dedication O
Feast, O
and O
how O
before O
that, O
at O
Easter, O
he O
had O
gone O
to O
the O
prison O
with O
Deniska O
and O
Ludmila O
the O
cook, O
and O
had O
taken O
the O
prisoners O
Easter O
bread, O
eggs, O
cakes O
and O
roast O
beef. O
The O
prisoners O
had O
thanked O
them O
and O
made O
the O
sign O
of O
the O
cross, O
and O
one O
of O
them O
had O
given O
Yegorushka O
a O
pewter O
buckle O
of O
his O
own O
making. O
The O
boy O
gazed O
at O
the O
familiar O
places, O
while O
the O
hateful O
chaise O
flew O
by O
and O
left O
them O
all O
behind. O
After O
the O
prison O
he O
caught O
glimpses O
of O
black O
grimy O
foundries, O
followed O
by O
the O
snug O
green O
cemetery O
surrounded O
by O
a O
wall O
of O
cobblestones; O
white O
crosses O
and O
tombstones, O
nestling O
among O
green O
cherry-trees O
and O
looking O
in O
the O
distance O
like O
patches O
of O
white, O
peeped O
out O
gaily O
from O
behind O
the O
wall. O
Yegorushka O
remembered O
that O
when O
the O
cherries O
were O
in O
blossom O
those O
white O
patches O
melted O
with O
the O
flowers O
into O
a O
sea O
of O
white; O
and O
that O
when O
the O
cherries O
were O
ripe O
the O
white O
tombstones O
and O
crosses O
were O
dotted O
with O
splashes O
of O
red O
like O
bloodstains. O
Under O
the O
cherry O
trees O
in O
the O
cemetery O
Yegorushka's O
father O
and O
granny, O
Zinaida O
Danilovna, O
lay O
sleeping O
day O
and O
night. O
When O
Granny O
had O
died O
she O
had O
been O
put O
in O
a O
long O
narrow O
coffin O
and O
two O
pennies O
had O
been O
put O
upon O
her O
eyes, O
which O
would O
not O
keep O
shut. O
Up O
to O
the O
time O
of O
her O
death O
she O
had O
been O
brisk, O
and O
used O
to O
bring O
soft O
rolls O
covered O
with O
poppy O
seeds O
from O
the O
market. O
Now O
she O
did O
nothing O
but O
sleep O
and O
sleep. O
. O
. O
. O
Beyond O
the O
cemetery O
came O
the O
smoking O
brickyards. O
From O
under O
the O
long O
roofs O
of O
reeds O
that O
looked O
as O
though O
pressed O
flat O
to O
the O
ground, O
a O
thick O
black O
smoke O
rose O
in O
great O
clouds O
and O
floated O
lazily O
upwards. O
The O
sky O
was O
murky O
above O
the O
brickyards O
and O
the O
cemetery, O
and O
great O
shadows O
from O
the O
clouds O
of O
smoke O
crept O
over O
the O
fields O
and O
across O
the O
roads. O
Men O
and O
horses O
covered O
with O
red O
dust O
were O
moving O
about O
in O
the O
smoke O
near O
the O
roofs. O
The O
town O
ended O
with O
the O
brickyards O
and O
the O
open O
country O
began. O
Yegorushka Entity
looked O
at O
the O
town O
for O
the O
last O
time, O
pressed O
his O
face O
against O
Deniska's O
elbow, O
and O
wept O
bitterly. O
"Come, Quotation
not Quotation
done Quotation

yet, Quotation
cry-baby!" Quotation
cried Cue
Kuzmitchov. Entity
"You Quotation

And O
considering O
that O
each O
of O
them O
had O
said O
something O
weighty O
and O
convincing, O
Kuzmitchov O
and O
Father O
Christopher O
both O
looked O
serious O
and O
cleared O
their O
throats O
simultaneously. O
Deniska, O
who O
had O
been O
listening O
to O
their O
conversation O
without O
understanding O
a O
word O
of O
it, O
shook O
his O
head O
and, O
rising O
in O
his O
seat, O
lashed O
at O
both O
the O
bays. O
A O
silence O
followed. O
Meanwhile O
a O
wide O
boundless O
plain O
encircled O
by O
a O
chain O
of O
low O
hills O
lay O
stretched O
before O
the O
travellers' O
eyes. O
Huddling O
together O
and O
peeping O
out O
from O
behind O
one O
another, O
these O
hills O
melted O
together O
into O
rising O
ground, O
which O
stretched O
right O
to O
the O
very O
horizon O
and O
disappeared O
into O
the O
lilac O
distance; O
one O
drives O
on O
and O
on O
and O
cannot O
discern O
where O
it O
begins O
or O
where O
it O
ends. O
. O
. O
. O
The O
sun O
had O
already O
peeped O
out O
from O
beyond O
the O
town O
behind O
them, O
and O
quietly, O
without O
fuss, O
set O
to O
its O
accustomed O
task. O
At O
first O
in O
the O
distance O
before O
them O
a O
broad, O
bright, O
yellow O
streak O
of O
light O
crept O
over O
the O
ground O
where O
the O
earth O
met O
the O
sky, O
near O
the O
little O
barrows O
and O
the O
windmills, O
which O
in O
the O
distance O
looked O
like O
tiny O
men O
waving O
their O
arms. O
A O
minute O
later O
a O
similar O
streak O
gleamed O
a O
little O
nearer, O
crept O
to O
the O
right O
and O
embraced O
the O
hills. O
Something O
warm O
touched O
Yegorushka's O
spine; O
the O
streak O
of O
light, O
stealing O
up O
from O
behind, O
darted O
between O
the O
chaise O
and O
the O
horses, O
moved O
to O
meet O
the O
other O
streak, O
and O
soon O
the O
whole O
wide O
steppe O
flung O
off O
the O
twilight O
of O
early O
morning, O
and O
was O
smiling O
and O
sparkling O
with O
dew. O
The O
cut O
rye, O
the O
coarse O
steppe O
grass, O
the O
milkwort, O
the O
wild O
hemp, O
all O
withered O
from O
the O
sultry O
heat, O
turned O
brown O
and O
half O
dead, O
now O
washed O
by O
the O
dew O
and O
caressed O
by O
the O
sun, O
revived, O
to O
fade O
again. O
Arctic O
petrels O
flew O
across O
the O
road O
with O
joyful O
cries; O
marmots O
called O
to O
one O
another O
in O
the O
grass. O
Somewhere, O
far O
away O
to O
the O
left, O
lapwings O
uttered O
their O
plaintive O
notes. O
A O
covey O
of O
partridges, O
scared O
by O
the O
chaise, O
fluttered O
up O
and O
with O
their O
soft O
"trrrr!" O
flew O
off O
to O
the O
hills. O
In O
the O
grass O
crickets, O
locusts O
and O
grasshoppers O
kept O
up O
their O
churring, O
monotonous O
music. O
But O
a O
little O
time O
passed, O
the O
dew O
evaporated, O
the O
air O
grew O
stagnant, O
and O
the O
disillusioned O
steppe O
began O
to O
wear O
its O
jaded O
July O
aspect. O
The O
grass O
drooped, O
everything O
living O
was O
hushed. O
The O
sun-baked O
hills, O
brownish-green O
and O
lilac O
in O
the O
distance, O
with O
their O
quiet O
shadowy O
tones, O
the O
plain O
with O
the O
misty O
distance O
and, O
arched O
above O
them, O
the O
sky, O
which O
seems O
terribly O
deep O
and O
transparent O
in O
the O
steppes, O
where O
there O
are O
no O
woods O
or O
high O
hills, O
seemed O
now O
endless, O
petrified O
with O
dreariness. O
. O
. O
. O
How O
stifling O
and O
oppressive O
it O
was! O
The O
chaise O
raced O
along, O
while O
Yegorushka O
saw O
always O
the O
same-- O
the O
sky, O
the O
plain, O
the O
low O
hills O
. O
. O
. O
. O
The O
music O
in O
the O
grass O
was O
hushed, O
the O
petrels O
had O
flown O
away, O
the O
partridges O
were O
out O
of O
sight, O
rooks O
hovered O
idly O
over O
the O
withered O
grass; O
they O
were O
all O
alike O
and O
made O
the O
steppe O
even O
more O
monotonous. O
A O
hawk O
flew O
just O
above O
the O
ground, O
with O
an O
even O
sweep O
of O
its O
wings, O
suddenly O
halted O
in O
the O
air O
as O
though O
pondering O
on O
the O
dreariness O
of O
life, O
then O
fluttered O
its O
wings O
and O
flew O
like O
an O
arrow O
over O
the O
steppe, O
and O
there O
was O
no O
telling O
why O
it O
flew O
off O
and O
what O
it O
wanted. O
In O
the O
distance O
a O
windmill O
waved O
its O
sails. O
. O
. O
. O
Now O
and O
then O
a O
glimpse O
of O
a O
white O
potsherd O
or O
a O
heap O
of O
stones O
broke O
the O
monotony; O
a O
grey O
stone O
stood O
out O
for O
an O
instant O
or O
a O
parched O
willow O
with O
a O
blue O
crow O
on O
its O
top O
branch; O
a O
marmot O
would O
run O
across O
the O
road O
and-- O
again O
there O
flitted O
before O
the O
eyes O
only O
the O
high O
grass, O
the O
low O
hills, O
the O
rooks. O
. O
. O
. O
But O
at O
last, O
thank O
God, O
a O
waggon O
loaded O
with O
sheaves O
came O
to O
meet O
them; O
a O
peasant O
wench O
was O
lying O
on O
the O
very O
top. O
Sleepy, O
exhausted O
by O
the O
heat, O
she O
lifted O
her O
head O
and O
looked O
at O
the O
travellers. O
Deniska O
gaped, O
looking O
at O
her; O
the O
horses O
stretched O
out O
their O
noses O
towards O
the O
sheaves; O
the O
chaise, O
squeaking, O
kissed O
the O
waggon, O
and O
the O
pointed O
ears O
passed O
over O
Father Entity
Christopher's Entity
hat O
like O
a O
brush. O
"You Quotation
are Quotation
driving Quotation
over Quotation
folks, Quotation
fatty!" Quotation
cried Cue
Deniska. Entity
"What Quotation
a Quotation
swollen Quotation
lump Quotation
of Quotation
a Quotation
face, Quotation
as Quotation
though Quotation
a Quotation
bumble-bee Quotation
had Quotation
stung Quotation
it!" Quotation
The O
girl O
smiled O
drowsily, O
and O
moving O
her O
lips O
lay O
down O
again; O
then O
a O
solitary O
poplar O
came O
into O
sight O
on O
the O
low O
hill. O
Someone O
had O
planted O
it, O
and O
God O
only O
knows O
why O
it O
was O
there. O
It O
was O
hard O
to O
tear O
the O
eyes O
away O
from O
its O
graceful O
figure O
and O
green O
drapery. O
Was O
that O
lovely O
creature O
happy? O
Sultry O
heat O
in O
summer, O
in O
winter O
frost O
and O
snowstorms, O
terrible O
nights O
in O
autumn O
when O
nothing O
is O
to O
be O
seen O
but O
darkness O
and O
nothing O
is O
to O
be O
heard O
but O
the O
senseless O
angry O
howling O
wind, O
and, O
worst O
of O
all, O
alone, O
alone O
for O
the O
whole O
of O
life O
. O
. O
. O
. O
Beyond O
the O
poplar O
stretches O
of O
wheat O
extended O
like O
a O
bright O
yellow O
carpet O
from O
the O
road O
to O
the O
top O
of O
the O
hills. O
On O
the O
hills O
the O
corn O
was O
already O
cut O
and O
laid O
up O
in O
sheaves, O
while O
at O
the O
bottom O
they O
were O
still O
cutting. O
. O
. O
. O
Six O
mowers O
were O
standing O
in O
a O
row O
swinging O
their O
scythes, O
and O
the O
scythes O
gleamed O
gaily O
and O
uttered O
in O
unison O
together O
"Vzhee, O
vzhee!" O
From O
the O
movements O
of O
the O
peasant O
women O
binding O
the O
sheaves, O
from O
the O
faces O
of O
the O
mowers, O
from O
the O
glitter O
of O
the O
scythes, O
it O
could O
be O
seen O
that O
the O
sultry O
heat O
was O
baking O
and O
stifling. O
A O
black O
dog O
with O
its O
tongue O
hanging O
out O
ran O
from O
the O
mowers O
to O
meet O
the O
chaise, O
probably O
with O
the O
intention O
of O
barking, O
but O
stopped O
halfway O
and O
stared O
indifferently O
at O
Deniska, O
who O
shook O
his O
whip O
at O
him; O
it O
was O
too O
hot O
to O
bark! O
One O
peasant O
woman O
got O
up O
and, O
putting O
both O
hands O
to O
her O
aching O
back, O
followed O
Yegorushka's O
red O
shirt O
with O
her O
eyes. O
Whether O
it O
was O
that O
the O
colour O
pleased O
her O
or O
that O
he O
reminded O
her O
of O
her O
children, O
she O
stood O
a O
long O
time O
motionless O
staring O
after O
him. O
But O
now O
the O
wheat, O
too, O
had O
flashed O
by; O
again O
the O
parched O
plain, O
the O
sunburnt O
hills, O
the O
sultry O
sky O
stretched O
before O
them; O
again O
a O
hawk O
hovered O
over O
the O
earth. O
In O
the O
distance, O
as O
before, O
a O
windmill O
whirled O
its O
sails, O
and O
still O
it O
looked O
like O
a O
little O
man O
waving O
his O
arms. O
It O
was O
wearisome O
to O
watch, O
and O
it O
seemed O
as O
though O
one O
would O
never O
reach O
it, O
as O
though O
it O
were O
running O
away O
from O
the O
chaise. O
Father O
Christopher O
and O
Kuzmitchov O
were O
silent. O
Deniska O
lashed O
the O
horses O
and O
kept O
shouting O
to O
them, O
while O
Yegorushka O
had O
left O
off O
crying, O
and O
gazed O
about O
him O
listlessly. O
The O
heat O
and O
the O
tedium O
of O
the O
steppes O
overpowered O
him. O
He O
felt O
as O
though O
he O
had O
been O
travelling O
and O
jolting O
up O
and O
down O
for O
a O
very O
long O
time, O
that O
the O
sun O
had O
been O
baking O
his O
back O
a O
long O
time. O
Before O
they O
had O
gone O
eight O
miles O
he O
began O
to O
feel O
"It O
must O
be O
time O
to O
rest." O
The O
geniality O
gradually O
faded O
out O
of O
his O
uncle's O
face O
and O
nothing O
else O
was O
left O
but O
the O
air O
of O
business O
reserve; O
and O
to O
a O
gaunt O
shaven O
face, O
especially O
when O
it O
is O
adorned O
with O
spectacles O
and O
the O
nose O
and O
temples O
are O
covered O
with O
dust, O
this O
reserve O
gives O
a O
relentless, O
inquisitorial O
appearance. O
Father O
Christopher O
never O
left O
off O
gazing O
with O
wonder O
at O
God's O
world, O
and O
smiling. O
Without O
speaking, O
he O
brooded O
over O
something O
pleasant O
and O
nice, O
and O
a O
kindly, O
genial O
smile O
remained O
imprinted O
on O
his O
face. O
It O
seemed O
as O
though O
some O
nice O
and O
pleasant O
thought O
were O
imprinted O
on O
his O
brain O
by O
the O
heat. O
"Well, Quotation
Deniska, Quotation
shall Quotation
we Quotation
overtake Quotation
the Quotation
waggons Quotation
to-day?" Quotation
asked Cue
Kuzmitchov. Entity
Deniska Entity
looked O
at O
the O
sky, O
rose O
in O
his O
seat, O
lashed O
at O
his O
horses O
and O
then O
answered: Cue
"By Quotation
nightfall, Quotation
please Quotation
God, Quotation
we Quotation
shall Quotation
overtake Quotation
them." Quotation
There O
was O
a O
sound O
of O
dogs O
barking. O
Half O
a O
dozen O
steppe O
sheep-dogs, O
suddenly O
leaping O
out O
as O
though O
from O
ambush, O
with O
ferocious O
howling O
barks, O
flew O
to O
meet O
the O
chaise. O
All O
of O
them, O
extraordinarily O
furious, O
surrounded O
the O
chaise, O
with O
their O
shaggy O
spider-like O
muzzles O
and O
their O
eyes O
red O
with O
anger, O
and O
jostling O
against O
one O
another O
in O
their O
anger, O
raised O
a O
hoarse O
howl. O
They O
were O
filled O
with O
passionate O
hatred O
of O
the O
horses, O
of O
the O
chaise, O
and O
of O
the O
human O
beings, O
and O
seemed O
ready O
to O
tear O
them O
into O
pieces. O
Deniska, O
who O
was O
fond O
of O
teasing O
and O
beating, O
was O
delighted O
at O
the O
chance O
of O
it, O
and O
with O
a O
malignant O
expression O
bent O
over O
and O
lashed O
at O
the O
sheep-dogs O
with O
his O
whip. O
The O
brutes O
growled O
more O
than O
ever, O
the O
horses O
flew O
on; O
and O
Yegorushka, O
who O
had O
difficulty O
in O
keeping O
his O
seat O
on O
the O
box, O
realized, O
looking O
at O
the O
dogs' O
eyes O
and O
teeth, O
that O
if O
he O
fell O
down O
they O
would O
instantly O
tear O
him O
to O
bits; O
but O
he O
felt O
no O
fear O
and O
looked O
at O
them O
as O
malignantly O
as O
Deniska, Entity
and O
regretted O
that O
he O
had O
no O
whip O
in O
his O
hand. O
The O
chaise O
came O
upon O
a O
flock O
of O
sheep. O
"Stop!" Quotation
cried Cue
Kuzmitchov. Entity
"Pull Quotation
up! Quotation
Woa!" Quotation
Deniska Entity
threw O
his O
whole O
body O
backwards O
and O
pulled O
up O
the O
horses. O
"Come Quotation
here!" Quotation
Kuzmitchov Entity
shouted Cue
to O
the Entity
shepherd. Entity
"Call Quotation
off Quotation
the Quotation
dogs, Quotation
curse Quotation
them!" Quotation
The O
old O
shepherd, O
tattered O
and O
barefoot, O
wearing O
a O
fur O
cap, O
with O
a O
dirty O
sack O
round O
his O
loins O
and O
a O
long O
crook O
in O
his O
hand O
-- O
a O
regular O
figure O
from O
the O
Old O
Testament-- O
called O
off O
the O
dogs, O
and O
taking O
off O
his O
cap, O
went O
up O
to O
the O
chaise. O
Another O
similar O
Old O
Testament O
figure O
was O
standing O
motionless O
at O
the O
other O
end O
of O
the O
flock, O
staring O
without O
interest O
at O
the O
travellers. O
"Whose Quotation
sheep Quotation
are Quotation
these?" Quotation
asked Cue
Kuzmitchov. Entity
"Varlamov's," Quotation
the Entity
old Entity
man Entity
answered Cue
in O
a O
loud O
voice. O
"Varlamov's," Quotation
repeated Cue
the Entity
shepherd Entity
standing O
at O
the O
other O
end O
of O
the O
flock. O
"Did Quotation
Varlamov Quotation
come Quotation
this Quotation
way Quotation
yesterday Quotation
or Quotation
not?" Quotation
"He Quotation
did Quotation
not; Quotation
his Quotation
clerk Quotation
came. Quotation
. Quotation
. Quotation
." Quotation
"Drive Quotation
on!" Quotation
The O
chaise O
rolled O
on O
and O
the O
shepherds, O
with O
their O
angry O
dogs, O
were O
left O
behind. O
Yegorushka O
gazed O
listlessly O
at O
the O
lilac O
distance O
in O
front, O
and O
it O
began O
to O
seem O
as O
though O
the O
windmill, O
waving O
its O
sails, O
were O
getting O
nearer. O
It O
became O
bigger O
and O
bigger, O
grew O
quite O
large, O
and O
now O
he O
could O
distinguish O
clearly O
its O
two O
sails. O
One O
sail O
was O
old O
and O
patched, O
the O
other O
had O
only O
lately O
been O
made O
of O
new O
wood O
and O
glistened O
in O
the O
sun. O
The O
chaise O
drove O
straight O
on, O
while O
the O
windmill, O
for O
some O
reason, O
began O
retreating O
to O
the O
left. O
They O
drove O
on O
and O
on, O
and O
the O
windmill O
kept O
moving O
away O
to O
the O
left, O
and O
still O
did O
not O
disappear. O
"A Quotation
fine Quotation
windmill Quotation
Boltva Quotation
has Quotation
put Quotation
up Quotation
for Quotation
his Quotation
son," Quotation
observed Cue
Deniska. Entity
"And Quotation
how Quotation
is Quotation
it Quotation
we Quotation
don't Quotation
see Quotation
his Quotation
farm?" Quotation
"It Quotation
is Quotation
that Quotation
way, Quotation
beyond Quotation
the Quotation
creek." Quotation
Boltva's O
farm, O
too, O
soon O
came O
into O
sight, O
but O
yet O
the O
windmill O
did O
not O
retreat, O
did O
not O
drop O
behind; O
it O
still O
watched O
Yegorushka Entity
with O
its O
shining O
sail O
and O
waved. O
What O
a O
sorcerer! O
II O
Towards O
midday O
the O
chaise O
turned O
off O
the O
road O
to O
the O
right; O
it O
went O
on O
a O
little O
way O
at O
walking O
pace O
and O
then O
stopped. O
Yegorushka O
heard O
a O
soft, O
very O
caressing O
gurgle, O
and O
felt O
a O
different O
air O
breathe O
on O
his O
face O
with O
a O
cool O
velvety O
touch. O
Through O
a O
little O
pipe O
of O
hemlock O
stuck O
there O
by O
some O
unknown O
benefactor, O
water O
was O
running O
in O
a O
thin O
trickle O
from O
a O
low O
hill, O
put O
together O
by O
nature O
of O
huge O
monstrous O
stones. O
It O
fell O
to O
the O
ground, O
and O
limpid, O
sparkling O
gaily O
in O
the O
sun, O
and O
softly O
murmuring O
as O
though O
fancying O
itself O
a O
great O
tempestuous O
torrent, O
flowed O
swiftly O
away O
to O
the O
left. O
Not O
far O
from O
its O
source O
the O
little O
stream O
spread O
itself O
out O
into O
a O
pool; O
the O
burning O
sunbeams O
and O
the O
parched O
soil O
greedily O
drank O
it O
up O
and O
sucked O
away O
its O
strength; O
but O
a O
little O
further O
on O
it O
must O
have O
mingled O
with O
another O
rivulet, O
for O
a O
hundred O
paces O
away O
thick O
reeds O
showed O
green O
and O
luxuriant O
along O
its O
course, O
and O
three O
snipe O
flew O
up O
from O
them O
with O
a O
loud O
cry O
as O
the O
chaise O
drove O
by. O
The O
travellers O
got O
out O
to O
rest O
by O
the O
stream O
and O
feed O
the O
horses. O
Kuzmitchov, O
Father O
Christopher O
and O
Yegorushka O
sat O
down O
on O
a O
mat O
in O
the O
narrow O
strip O
of O
shade O
cast O
by O
the O
chaise O
and O
the O
unharnessed O
horses. O
The O
nice O
pleasant O
thought O
that O
the O
heat O
had O
imprinted O
in O
Father O
Christopher's O
brain O
craved O
expression O
after O
he O
had O
had O
a O
drink O
of O
water O
and O
eaten O
a O
hard-boiled O
egg. O
He Entity
bent O
a O
friendly O
look O
upon O
Yegorushka, O
munched, O
and O
began: Cue
"I Quotation
studied Quotation
too, Quotation
my Quotation
boy; Quotation
from Quotation
the Quotation
earliest Quotation
age Quotation
God Quotation
instilled Quotation
into Quotation
me Quotation
good Quotation
sense Quotation
and Quotation
understanding, Quotation
so Quotation
that Quotation
while Quotation
I Quotation
was Quotation
just Quotation
such Quotation
a Quotation
lad Quotation
as Quotation
you Quotation
I Quotation
was Quotation
beyond Quotation
others, Quotation
a Quotation
comfort Quotation
to Quotation
my Quotation
parents Quotation
and Quotation
preceptors Quotation
by Quotation
my Quotation
good Quotation
sense. Quotation
Before Quotation
I Quotation
was Quotation
fifteen Quotation
I Quotation
could Quotation
speak Quotation
and Quotation
make Quotation
verses Quotation
in Quotation
Latin, Quotation
just Quotation
as Quotation
in Quotation
Russian. Quotation
I Quotation
was Quotation
the Quotation
crosier-bearer Quotation
to Quotation
his Quotation
Holiness Quotation
Bishop Quotation
Christopher. Quotation
After Quotation
mass Quotation
one Quotation
day, Quotation
as Quotation
I Quotation
remember Quotation
it Quotation
was Quotation
the Quotation
patron Quotation
saint's Quotation
day Quotation
of Quotation
His Quotation
Majesty Quotation
Tsar Quotation
Alexandr Quotation
Pavlovitch Quotation
of Quotation
blessed Quotation
memory, Quotation
he Quotation
unrobed Quotation
at Quotation
the Quotation
altar, Quotation
looked Quotation
kindly Quotation
at Quotation
me Quotation
and Quotation
asked, Quotation
'Puer Quotation
bone, Quotation
quam Quotation
appelaris?' Quotation
And Quotation
I Quotation
answered, Quotation
'Christopherus Quotation
sum;' Quotation
and Quotation
he Quotation
said, Quotation
'Ergo Quotation
connominati Quotation
sumus'-- Quotation
that Quotation
is, Quotation
that Quotation
we Quotation
were Quotation
namesakes. Quotation
. Quotation
. Quotation
Then Quotation
he Quotation
asked Quotation
in Quotation
Latin, Quotation
'Whose Quotation
son Quotation
are Quotation
you?' Quotation
To Quotation
which Quotation
I Quotation
answered, Quotation
also Quotation
in Quotation
Latin, Quotation
that Quotation
I Quotation
was Quotation
the Quotation
son Quotation
of Quotation
deacon Quotation
Sireysky Quotation
of Quotation
the Quotation
village Quotation
of Quotation
Lebedinskoe. Quotation
Seeing Quotation
my Quotation
readiness Quotation
and Quotation
the Quotation
clearness Quotation
of Quotation
my Quotation
answers, Quotation
his Quotation
Holiness Quotation
blessed Quotation
me Quotation
and Quotation
said, Quotation
'Write Quotation
to Quotation
your Quotation
father Quotation
that Quotation
I Quotation
will Quotation
not Quotation
forget Quotation
him, Quotation
and Quotation
that Quotation
I Quotation
will Quotation
keep Quotation
you Quotation
in Quotation
view.' Quotation
The Quotation
holy Quotation
priests Quotation
and Quotation
fathers Quotation
who Quotation
were Quotation
standing Quotation
round Quotation
the Quotation
altar, Quotation
hearing Quotation
our Quotation
discussion Quotation
in Quotation
Latin, Quotation
were Quotation
not Quotation
a Quotation
little Quotation
surprised, Quotation
and Quotation
everyone Quotation
expressed Quotation
his Quotation
pleasure Quotation
in Quotation
praise Quotation
of Quotation
me. Quotation
Before Quotation
I Quotation
had Quotation
moustaches, Quotation
my Quotation
boy, Quotation
I Quotation
could Quotation
read Quotation
Latin, Quotation
Greek, Quotation
and Quotation
French; Quotation
I Quotation
knew Quotation
philosophy, Quotation
mathematics, Quotation
secular Quotation
history, Quotation
and Quotation
all Quotation
the Quotation
sciences. Quotation
The Quotation
Lord Quotation
gave Quotation
me Quotation
a Quotation
marvellous Quotation
memory. Quotation
Sometimes, Quotation
if Quotation
I Quotation
read Quotation
a Quotation
thing Quotation
once Quotation
or Quotation
twice, Quotation
I Quotation
knew Quotation
it Quotation
by Quotation
heart. Quotation
My Quotation
preceptors Quotation
and Quotation
patrons Quotation
were Quotation
amazed, Quotation
and Quotation
so Quotation
they Quotation
expected Quotation
I Quotation
should Quotation
make Quotation
a Quotation
learned Quotation
man, Quotation
a Quotation
luminary Quotation
of Quotation
the Quotation
Church. Quotation
I Quotation
did Quotation
think Quotation
of Quotation
going Quotation
to Quotation
Kiev Quotation
to Quotation
continue Quotation
my Quotation
studies, Quotation
but Quotation
my Quotation
parents Quotation
did Quotation
not Quotation
approve. Quotation
'You'll Quotation
be Quotation
studying Quotation
all Quotation
your Quotation
life,' Quotation
said Quotation
my Quotation
father; Quotation
'when Quotation
shall Quotation
we Quotation
see Quotation
you Quotation
finished?' Quotation
Hearing Quotation
such Quotation
words, Quotation
I Quotation
gave Quotation
up Quotation
study Quotation
and Quotation
took Quotation
a Quotation
post. Quotation
. Quotation
. Quotation
. Quotation
Of Quotation
course, Quotation
I Quotation
did Quotation
not Quotation
become Quotation
a Quotation
learned Quotation
man, Quotation
but Quotation
then Quotation
I Quotation
did Quotation
not Quotation
disobey Quotation
my Quotation
parents; Quotation
I Quotation
was Quotation
a Quotation
comfort Quotation
to Quotation
them Quotation
in Quotation
their Quotation
old Quotation
age Quotation
and Quotation
gave Quotation
them Quotation
a Quotation
creditable Quotation
funeral. Quotation
Obedience Quotation
is Quotation
more Quotation
than Quotation
fasting Quotation
and Quotation
prayer. Quotation
 Quotation
I Quotation
suppose Quotation
you Quotation
have Quotation
forgotten Quotation
all Quotation
your Quotation
learning?" Quotation
observed O
Kuzmitchov. O
"I O
should O
think O
so! O
Thank O
God, O
I O
have O
reached O
my O
eightieth O
year! O
Something O
of O
philosophy O
and O
rhetoric O
I O
do O
remember, O
but O
languages O
and O
mathematics O
I O
have O
quite O
forgotten." O
Father O
Christopher O
screwed O
up O
his O
eyes, O
thought O
a O
minute O
and O
said O
in O
an O
undertone: O
"What O
is O
a O
substance? O
A O
creature O
is O
a O
self-existing O
object, O
not O
requiring O
anything O
else O
for O
its O
completion." O
He O
shook O
his O
head O
and O
laughed O
with O
feeling. O
"Spiritual O
nourishment!" O
he O
said. O
"Of O
a O
truth O
matter O
nourishes O
the O
flesh O
and O
spiritual O
nourishment O
the O
soul!" O
"Learning O
is O
all O
very O
well," O
sighed O
Kuzmitchov, O
"but O
if O
we O
don't O
overtake O
Varlamov, O
learning O
won't O
do O
much O
for O
us." O
"A O
man O
isn't O
a O
needle-- O
we O
shall O
find O
him. O
He O
must O
be O
going O
his O
rounds O
in O
these O
parts." O
Among O
the O
sedge O
were O
flying O
the O
three O
snipe O
they O
had O
seen O
before, O
and O
in O
their O
plaintive O
cries O
there O
was O
a O
note O
of O
alarm O
and O
vexation O
at O
having O
been O
driven O
away O
from O
the O
stream. O
The O
horses O
were O
steadily O
munching O
and O
snorting. O
Deniska O
walked O
about O
by O
them O
and, O
trying O
to O
appear O
indifferent O
to O
the O
cucumbers, O
pies, O
and O
eggs O
that O
the O
gentry O
were O
eating, O
he O
concentrated O
himself O
on O
the O
gadflies O
and O
horseflies O
that O
were O
fastening O
upon O
the O
horses' O
backs O
and O
bellies; O
he O
squashed O
his O
victims O
apathetically, O
emitting O
a O
peculiar, O
fiendishly O
triumphant, O
guttural O
sound, O
and O
when O
he O
missed O
them O
cleared O
his O
throat O
with O
an O
air O
of O
vexation O
and O
looked O
after O
every O
lucky O
one O
that O
escaped O
death. O
"Deniska, O
where O
are O
you? O
Come O
and O
eat," O
said O
Kuzmitchov, O
heaving O
a O
deep O
sigh, O
a O
sign O
that O
he O
had O
had O
enough. O
Deniska O
diffidently O
approached O
the O
mat O
and O
picked O
out O
five O
thick O
and O
yellow O
cucumbers O
(he O
did O
not O
venture O
to O
take O
the O
smaller O
and O
fresher O
ones), O
took O
two O
hard-boiled O
eggs O
that O
looked O
dark O
and O
were O
cracked, O
then O
irresolutely, O
as O
though O
afraid O
he O
might O
get O
a O
blow O
on O
his O
outstretched O
hand, O
touched O
a O
pie O
with O
his O
finger. O
"Take O
them, O
take O
them," O
Kuzmitchov O
urged O
him O
on. O
Deniska O
took O
the O
pies O
resolutely, O
and, O
moving O
some O
distance O
away, O
sat O
down O
on O
the O
grass O
with O
his O
back O
to O
the O
chaise. O
At O
once O
there O
was O
such O
a O
sound O
of O
loud O
munching O
that O
even O
the O
horses O
turned O
round O
to O
look O
suspiciously O
at O
Deniska. O
After O
his O
meal O
Kuzmitchov O
took O
a O
sack O
containing O
something O
out O
of O
the O
chaise O
and O
said O
to O
Yegorushka: O
"I O
am O
going O
to O
sleep, O
and O
you O
mind O
that O
no O
one O
takes O
the O
sack O
from O
under O
my O
head." O
Father O
Christopher O
took O
off O
his O
cassock, O
his O
girdle, O
and O
his O
full O
coat, O
and O
Yegorushka, O
looking O
at O
him, O
was O
dumb O
with O
astonishment. O
He O
had O
never O
imagined O
that O
priests O
wore O
trousers, O
and O
Father O
Christopher O
had O
on O
real O
canvas O
trousers O
thrust O
into O
high O
boots, O
and O
a O
short O
striped O
jacket. O
Looking O
at O
him, O
Yegorushka O
thought O
that O
in O
this O
costume, O
so O
unsuitable O
to O
his O
dignified O
position, O
he O
looked O
with O
his O
long O
hair O
and O
beard O
very O
much O
like O
Robinson O
Crusoe. O
After O
taking O
off O
their O
outer O
garments O
Kuzmitchov O
and O
Father O
Christopher O
lay O
down O
in O
the O
shade O
under O
the O
chaise, O
facing O
one O
another, O
and O
closed O
their O
eyes. O
Deniska, O
who O
had O
finished O
munching, O
stretched O
himself O
out O
on O
his O
back O
and O
also O
closed O
his O
eyes. O
"You O
look O
out O
that O
no O
one O
takes O
away O
the O
horses!" O
he O
said O
to O
Yegorushka, O
and O
at O
once O
fell O
asleep. O
Stillness O
reigned. O
There O
was O
no O
sound O
except O
the O
munching O
and O
snorting O
of O
the O
horses O
and O
the O
snoring O
of O
the O
sleepers; O
somewhere O
far O
away O
a O
lapwing O
wailed, O
and O
from O
time O
to O
time O
there O
sounded O
the O
shrill O
cries O
of O
the O
three O
snipe O
who O
had O
flown O
up O
to O
see O
whether O
their O
uninvited O
visitors O
had O
gone O
away; O
the O
rivulet O
babbled, O
lisping O
softly, O
but O
all O
these O
sounds O
did O
not O
break O
the O
stillness, O
did O
not O
stir O
the O
stagnation, O
but, O
on O
the O
contrary, O
lulled O
all O
nature O
to O
slumber. O
Yegorushka, O
gasping O
with O
the O
heat, O
which O
was O
particularly O
oppressive O
after O
a O
meal, O
ran O
to O
the O
sedge O
and O
from O
there O
surveyed O
the O
country. O
He O
saw O
exactly O
the O
same O
as O
he O
had O
in O
the O
morning: O
the O
plain, O
the O
low O
hills, O
the O
sky, O
the O
lilac O
distance; O
only O
the O
hills O
stood O
nearer; O
and O
he O
could O
not O
see O
the O
windmill, O
which O
had O
been O
left O
far O
behind. O
From O
behind O
the O
rocky O
hill O
from O
which O
the O
stream O
flowed O
rose O
another, O
smoother O
and O
broader; O
a O
little O
hamlet O
of O
five O
or O
six O
homesteads O
clung O
to O
it. O
No O
people, O
no O
trees, O
no O
shade O
were O
to O
be O
seen O
about O
the O
huts; O
it O
looked O
as O
though O
the O
hamlet O
had O
expired O
in O
the O
burning O
air O
and O
was O
dried O
up. O
To O
while O
away O
the O
time O
Yegorushka O
caught O
a O
grasshopper O
in O
the O
grass, O
held O
it O
in O
his O
closed O
hand O
to O
his O
ear, O
and O
spent O
a O
long O
time O
listening O
to O
the O
creature O
playing O
on O
its O
instrument. O
When O
he O
was O
weary O
of O
its O
music O
he O
ran O
after O
a O
flock O
of O
yellow O
butterflies O
who O
were O
flying O
towards O
the O
sedge O
on O
the O
watercourse, O
and O
found O
himself O
again O
beside O
the O
chaise, O
without O
noticing O
how O
he O
came O
there. O
His O
uncle O
and O
Father O
Christopher O
were O
sound O
asleep; O
their O
sleep O
would O
be O
sure O
to O
last O
two O
or O
three O
hours O
till O
the O
horses O
had O
rested. O
. O
. O
. O
How O
was O
he O
to O
get O
through O
that O
long O
time, O
and O
where O
was O
he O
to O
get O
away O
from O
the O
heat? O
A O
hard O
problem. O
. O
. O
. O
Mechanically O
Yegorushka O
put O
his O
lips O
to O
the O
trickle O
that O
ran O
from O
the O
waterpipe; O
there O
was O
a O
chilliness O
in O
his O
mouth O
and O
there O
was O
the O
smell O
of O
hemlock. O
He O
drank O
at O
first O
eagerly, O
then O
went O
on O
with O
effort O
till O
the O
sharp O
cold O
had O
run O
from O
his O
mouth O
all O
over O
his O
body O
and O
the O
water O
was O
spilt O
on O
his O
shirt. O
Then O
he O
went O
up O
to O
the O
chaise O
and O
began O
looking O
at O
the O
sleeping O
figures. O
His O
uncle's O
face O
wore, O
as O
before, O
an O
expression O
of O
business-like O
reserve. O
Fanatically O
devoted O
to O
his O
work, O
Kuzmitchov O
always, O
even O
in O
his O
sleep O
and O
at O
church O
when O
they O
were O
singing, O
"Like O
the O
cherubim," O
thought O
about O
his O
business O
and O
could O
never O
forget O
it O
for O
a O
moment; O
and O
now O
he O
was O
probably O
dreaming O
about O
bales O
of O
wool, O
waggons, O
prices, O
Varlamov. O
. O
. O
. O
Father O
Christopher, O
now, O
a O
soft, O
frivolous O
and O
absurd O
person, O
had O
never O
all O
his O
life O
been O
conscious O
of O
anything O
which O
could, O
like O
a O
boa-constrictor, O
coil O
about O
his O
soul O
and O
hold O
it O
tight. O
In O
all O
the O
numerous O
enterprises O
he O
had O
undertaken O
in O
his O
day O
what O
attracted O
him O
was O
not O
so O
much O
the O
business O
itself, O
but O
the O
bustle O
and O
the O
contact O
with O
other O
people O
involved O
in O
every O
undertaking. O
Thus, O
in O
the O
present O
expedition, O
he O
was O
not O
so O
much O
interested O
in O
wool, O
in O
Varlamov, O
and O
in O
prices, O
as O
in O
the O
long O
journey, O
the O
conversations O
on O
the O
way, O
the O
sleeping O
under O
a O
chaise, O
and O
the O
meals O
at O
odd O
times. O
. O
. O
. O
And O
now, O
judging O
from O
his O
face, O
he O
must O
have O
been O
dreaming O
of O
Bishop O
Christopher, O
of O
the O
Latin O
discussion, O
of O
his O
wife, O
of O
puffs O
and O
cream O
and O
all O
sorts O
of O
things O
that O
Kuzmitchov O
could O
not O
possibly O
dream O
of. O
While O
Yegorushka O
was O
watching O
their O
sleeping O
faces O
he O
suddenly O
heard O
a O
soft O
singing; O
somewhere O
at O
a O
distance O
a O
woman O
was O
singing, O
and O
it O
was O
difficult O
to O
tell O
where O
and O
in O
what O
direction. O
The O
song O
was O
subdued, O
dreary O
and O
melancholy, O
like O
a O
dirge, O
and O
hardly O
audible, O
and O
seemed O
to O
come O
first O
from O
the O
right, O
then O
from O
the O
left, O
then O
from O
above, O
and O
then O
from O
underground, O
as O
though O
an O
unseen O
spirit O
were O
hovering O
over O
the O
steppe O
and O
singing. O
Yegorushka O
looked O
about O
him, O
and O
could O
not O
make O
out O
where O
the O
strange O
song O
came O
from. O
Then O
as O
he O
listened O
he O
began O
to O
fancy O
that O
the O
grass O
was O
singing; O
in O
its O
song, O
withered O
and O
half-dead, O
it O
was O
without O
words, O
but O
plaintively O
and O
passionately, O
urging O
that O
it O
was O
not O
to O
blame, O
that O
the O
sun O
was O
burning O
it O
for O
no O
fault O
of O
its O
own; O
it O
urged O
that O
it O
ardently O
longed O
to O
live, O
that O
it O
was O
young O
and O
might O
have O
been O
beautiful O
but O
for O
the O
heat O
and O
the O
drought; O
it O
was O
guiltless, O
but O
yet O
it O
prayed O
forgiveness O
and O
protested O
that O
it O
was O
in O
anguish, O
sad O
and O
sorry O
for O
itself. O
. O
. O
. O
Yegorushka O
listened O
for O
a O
little, O
and O
it O
began O
to O
seem O
as O
though O
this O
dreary, O
mournful O
song O
made O
the O
air O
hotter, O
more O
suffocating O
and O
more O
stagnant. O
. O
. O
. O
To O
drown O
the O
singing O
he O
ran O
to O
the O
sedge, O
humming O
to O
himself O
and O
trying O
to O
make O
a O
noise O
with O
his O
feet. O
From O
there O
he O
looked O
about O
in O
all O
directions O
and O
found O
out O
who O
was O
singing. O
Near O
the O
furthest O
hut O
in O
the O
hamlet O
stood O
a O
peasant O
woman O
in O
a O
short O
petticoat, O
with O
long O
thin O
legs O
like O
a O
heron. O
She O
was O
sowing O
something. O
A O
white O
dust O
floated O
languidly O
from O
her O
sieve O
down O
the O
hillock. O
Now O
it O
was O
evident O
that O
she O
was O
singing. O
A O
couple O
of O
yards O
from O
her O
a O
little O
bare-headed O
boy O
in O
nothing O
but O
a O
smock O
was O
standing O
motionless. O
As O
though O
fascinated O
by O
the O
song, O
he O
stood O
stock-still, O
staring O
away O
into O
the O
distance, O
probably O
at O
Yegorushka's O
crimson O
shirt. O
The O
song O
ceased. O
Yegorushka O
sauntered O
back O
to O
the O
chaise, O
and O
to O
while O
away O
the O
time O
went O
again O
to O
the O
trickle O
of O
water. O
And O
again O
there O
was O
the O
sound O
of O
the O
dreary O
song. O
It O
was O
the O
same O
long-legged O
peasant O
woman O
in O
the O
hamlet O
over O
the O
hill. O
Yegorushka's O
boredom O
came O
back O
again. O
He O
left O
the O
pipe O
and O
looked O
upwards. O
What O
he O
saw O
was O
so O
unexpected O
that O
he O
was O
a O
little O
frightened. O
Just O
above O
his O
head O
on O
one O
of O
the O
big O
clumsy O
stones O
stood O
a O
chubby O
little O
boy, O
wearing O
nothing O
but O
a O
shirt, O
with O
a O
prominent O
stomach O
and O
thin O
legs, O
the O
same O
boy O
who O
had O
been O
standing O
before O
by O
the O
peasant O
woman. O
He O
was O
gazing O
with O
open O
mouth O
and O
unblinking O
eyes O
at O
Yegorushka's O
crimson O
shirt O
and O
at O
the O
chaise, O
with O
a O
look O
of O
blank O
astonishment O
and O
even O
fear, O
as O
though O
he O
saw O
before O
him O
creatures O
of O
another O
world. O
The O
red O
colour O
of O
the O
shirt O
charmed O
and O
allured O
him. O
But O
the O
chaise O
and O
the O
men O
sleeping O
under O
it O
excited O
his O
curiosity; O
perhaps O
he O
had O
not O
noticed O
how O
the O
agreeable O
red O
colour O
and O
curiosity O
had O
attracted O
him O
down O
from O
the O
hamlet, O
and O
now O
probably O
he O
was O
surprised O
at O
his O
own O
boldness. O
For O
a O
long O
while O
Yegorushka O
stared O
at O
him, O
and O
he O
at O
Yegorushka. O
Both O
were O
silent O
and O
conscious O
of O
some O
awkwardness. O
After O
a O
long O
silence O
Yegorushka O
asked: O
"What's O
your O
name?" O
The O
stranger's O
cheeks O
puffed O
out O
more O
than O
ever; O
he O
pressed O
his O
back O
against O
the O
rock, O
opened O
his O
eyes O
wide, O
moved O
his O
lips, O
and O
answered O
in O
a O
husky O
bass: O
"Tit!" O
The O
boys O
said O
not O
another O
word O
to O
each O
other; O
after O
a O
brief O
silence, O
still O
keeping O
his O
eyes O
fixed O
on O
Yegorushka, O
the O
mysterious O
Tit O
kicked O
up O
one O
leg, O
felt O
with O
his O
heel O
for O
a O
niche O
and O
clambered O
up O
the O
rock; O
from O
that O
point O
he O
ascended O
to O
the O
next O
rock, O
staggering O
backwards O
and O
looking O
intently O
at O
Yegorushka, O
as O
though O
afraid O
he O
might O
hit O
him O
from O
behind, O
and O
so O
made O
his O
way O
upwards O
till O
he O
disappeared O
altogether O
behind O
the O
crest O
of O
the O
hill. O
After O
watching O
him O
out O
of O
sight, O
Yegorushka O
put O
his O
arms O
round O
his O
knees O
and O
leaned O
his O
head O
on O
them. O
. O
. O
. O
The O
burning O
sun O
scorched O
the O
back O
of O
his O
head, O
his O
neck, O
and O
his O
spine. O
The O
melancholy O
song O
died O
away, O
then O
floated O
again O
on O
the O
stagnant O
stifling O
air. O
The O
rivulet O
gurgled O
monotonously, O
the O
horses O
munched, O
and O
time O
dragged O
on O
endlessly, O
as O
though O
it, O
too, O
were O
stagnant O
and O
had O
come O
to O
a O
standstill. O
It O
seemed O
as O
though O
a O
hundred O
years O
had O
passed O
since O
the O
morning. O
Could O
it O
be O
that O
God's O
world, O
the O
chaise O
and O
the O
horses O
would O
come O
to O
a O
standstill O
in O
that O
air, O
and, O
like O
the O
hills, O
turn O
to O
stone O
and O
remain O
for O
ever O
in O
one O
spot? O
Yegorushka O
raised O
his O
head, O
and O
with O
smarting O
eyes O
looked O
before O
him; O
the O
lilac O
distance, O
which O
till O
then O
had O
been O
motionless, O
began O
heaving, O
and O
with O
the O
sky O
floated O
away O
into O
the O
distance. O
. O
. O
. O
It O
drew O
after O
it O
the O
brown O
grass, O
the O
sedge, O
and O
with O
extraordinary O
swiftness O
Yegorushka O
floated O
after O
the O
flying O
distance. O
Some O
force O
noiselessly O
drew O
him O
onwards, O
and O
the O
heat O
and O
the O
wearisome O
song O
flew O
after O
in O
pursuit. O
Yegorushka O
bent O
his O
head O
and O
shut O
his O
eyes. O
. O
. O
. O
Deniska O
was O
the O
first O
to O
wake O
up. O
Something O
must O
have O
bitten O
him, O
for O
he O
jumped O
up, O
quickly O
scratched O
his O
shoulder O
and O
said: O
"Plague O
take O
you, O
cursed O
idolater!" O
Then O
he O
went O
to O
the O
brook, O
had O
a O
drink O
and O
slowly O
washed. O
His O
splashing O
and O
puffing O
roused O
Yegorushka O
from O
his O
lethargy. O
The O
boy O
looked O
at O
his O
wet O
face O
with O
drops O
of O
water O
and O
big O
freckles O
which O
made O
it O
look O
like O
marble, O
and O
asked: O
"Shall O
we O
soon O
be O
going?" O
Deniska O
looked O
at O
the O
height O
of O
the O
sun O
and O
answered: O
"I O
expect O
so." O
He O
dried O
himself O
with O
the O
tail O
of O
his O
shirt O
and, O
making O
a O
very O
serious O
face, O
hopped O
on O
one O
leg. O
"I O
say, O
which O
of O
us O
will O
get O
to O
the O
sedge O
first?" O
he O
said. O
Yegorushka O
was O
exhausted O
by O
the O
heat O
and O
drowsiness, O
but O
he O
raced O
off O
after O
him O
all O
the O
same. O
Deniska O
was O
in O
his O
twentieth O
year, O
was O
a O
coachman O
and O
going O
to O
be O
married, O
but O
he O
had O
not O
left O
off O
being O
a O
boy. O
He O
was O
very O
fond O
of O
flying O
kites, O
chasing O
pigeons, O
playing O
knuckle-bones, O
running O
races, O
and O
always O
took O
part O
in O
children's O
games O
and O
disputes. O
No O
sooner O
had O
his O
master O
turned O
his O
back O
or O
gone O
to O
sleep O
than O
Deniska O
would O
begin O
doing O
something O
such O
as O
hopping O
on O
one O
leg O
or O
throwing O
stones. O
It O
was O
hard O
for O
any O
grown-up O
person, O
seeing O
the O
genuine O
enthusiasm O
with O
which O
he O
frolicked O
about O
in O
the O
society O
of O
children, O
to O
resist O
saying, O
"What O
a O
baby!" O
Children, O
on O
the O
other O
hand, O
saw O
nothing O
strange O
in O
the O
invasion O
of O
their O
domain O
by O
the O
big O
coachman. O
"Let O
him O
play," O
they O
thought, O
"as O
long O
as O
he O
doesn't O
fight!" O
In O
the O
same O
way O
little O
dogs O
see O
nothing O
strange O
in O
it O
when O
a O
simple-hearted O
big O
dog O
joins O
their O
company O
uninvited O
and O
begins O
playing O
with O
them. O
Deniska O
outstripped O
Yegorushka, O
and O
was O
evidently O
very O
much O
pleased O
at O
having O
done O
so. O
He O
winked O
at O
him, O
and O
to O
show O
that O
he O
could O
hop O
on O
one O
leg O
any O
distance, O
suggested O
to O
Yegorushka O
that O
he O
should O
hop O
with O
him O
along O
the O
road O
and O
from O
there, O
without O
resting, O
back O
to O
the O
chaise. O
Yegorushka O
declined O
this O
suggestion, O
for O
he O
was O
very O
much O
out O
of O
breath O
and O
exhausted. O
All O
at O
once O
Deniska O
looked O
very O
grave, O
as O
he O
did O
not O
look O
even O
when O
Kuzmitchov O
gave O
him O
a O
scolding O
or O
threatened O
him O
with O
a O
stick; O
listening O
intently, O
he O
dropped O
quietly O
on O
one O
knee O
and O
an O
expression O
of O
sternness O
and O
alarm O
came O
into O
his O
face, O
such O
as O
one O
sees O
in O
people O
who O
hear O
heretical O
talk. O
He O
fixed O
his O
eyes O
on O
one O
spot, O
raised O
his O
hand O
curved O
into O
a O
hollow, O
and O
suddenly O
fell O
on O
his O
stomach O
on O
the O
ground O
and O
slapped O
the O
hollow O
of O
his O
hand O
down O
upon O
the O
grass. O
"Caught!" O
he O
wheezed O
triumphantly, O
and, O
getting O
up, O
lifted O
a O
big O
grasshopper O
to O
Yegorushka's O
eyes. O
The O
two O
boys O
stroked O
the O
grasshopper's O
broad O
green O
back O
with O
their O
fingers O
and O
touched O
his O
antenna, O
supposing O
that O
this O
would O
please O
the O
creature. O
Then O
Deniska O
caught O
a O
fat O
fly O
that O
had O
been O
sucking O
blood O
and O
offered O
it O
to O
the O
grasshopper. O
The O
latter O
moved O
his O
huge O
jaws, O
that O
were O
like O
the O
visor O
of O
a O
helmet, O
with O
the O
utmost O
unconcern, O
as O
though O
he O
had O
been O
long O
acquainted O
with O
Deniska, O
and O
bit O
off O
the O
fly's O
stomach. O
They O
let O
him O
go. O
With O
a O
flash O
of O
the O
pink O
lining O
of O
his O
wings, O
he O
flew O
down O
into O
the O
grass O
and O
at O
once O
began O
his O
churring O
notes O
again. O
They O
let O
the O
fly O
go, O
too. O
It O
preened O
its O
wings, O
and O
without O
its O
stomach O
flew O
off O
to O
the O
horses. O
A O
loud O
sigh O
was O
heard O
from O
under O
the O
chaise. O
It O
was O
Kuzmitchov O
waking O
up. O
He O
quickly O
raised O
his O
head, O
looked O
uneasily O
into O
the O
distance, O
and O
from O
that O
look, O
which O
passed O
by O
Yegorushka O
and O
Deniska O
without O
sympathy O
or O
interest, O
it O
could O
be O
seen O
that O
his O
thought O
on O
awaking O
was O
of O
the O
wool O
and O
of O
Varlamov. O
"Father O
Christopher, O
get O
up; O
it O
is O
time O
to O
start," O
he O
said O
anxiously. O
"Wake O
up; O
we've O
slept O
too O
long O
as O
it O
is! O
Deniska, O
put O
the O
horses O
in." O
Father O
Christopher O
woke O
up O
with O
the O
same O
smile O
with O
which O
he O
had O
fallen O
asleep; O
his O
face O
looked O
creased O
and O
wrinkled O
from O
sleep, O
and O
seemed O
only O
half O
the O
size. O
After O
washing O
and O
dressing, O
he O
proceeded O
without O
haste O
to O
take O
out O
of O
his O
pocket O
a O
little O
greasy O
psalter; O
and O
standing O
with O
his O
face O
towards O
the O
east, O
began O
in O
a O
whisper O
repeating O
the O
psalms O
of O
the O
day O
and O
crossing O
himself. O
"Father O
Christopher," O
said O
Kuzmitchov O
reproachfully, O
"it's O
time O
to O
start; O
the O
horses O
are O
ready, O
and O
here O
are O
you, O
. O
. O
. O
upon O
my O
word." O
"In O
a O
minute, O
in O
a O
minute," O
muttered O
Father O
Christopher. O
"I O
must O
read O
the O
psalms. O
. O
. O
. O
I O
haven't O
read O
them O
to-day." O
"The O
psalms O
can O
wait." O
"Ivan O
Ivanitch, O
that O
is O
my O
rule O
every O
day. O
. O
. O
. O
I O
can't O
. O
. O
." O
"God O
will O
overlook O
it." O
For O
a O
full O
quarter O
of O
an O
hour O
Father O
Christopher O
stood O
facing O
the O
east O
and O
moving O
his O
lips, O
while O
Kuzmitchov O
looked O
at O
him O
almost O
with O
hatred O
and O
impatiently O
shrugged O
his O
shoulders. O
He O
was O
particularly O
irritated O
when, O
after O
every O
"Hallelujah," O
Father O
Christopher O
drew O
a O
long O
breath, O
rapidly O
crossed O
himself O
and O
repeated O
three O
times, O
intentionally O
raising O
his O
voice O
so O
that O
the O
others O
might O
cross O
themselves, O
"Hallelujah, O
hallelujah, O
hallelujah! O
Glory O
be O
to O
Thee, O
O O
Lord!" O
At O
last O
he O
smiled, O
looked O
upwards O
at O
the O
sky, O
and, O
putting O
the O
psalter O
in O
his O
pocket, O
said: O
"Finis!" O
A O
minute O
later O
the O
chaise O
had O
started O
on O
the O
road. O
As O
though O
it O
were O
going O
backwards O
and O
not O
forwards, O
the O
travellers O
saw O
the O
same O
scene O
as O
they O
had O
before O
midday. O
The O
low O
hills O
were O
still O
plunged O
in O
the O
lilac O
distance, O
and O
no O
end O
could O
be O
seen O
to O
them. O
There O
were O
glimpses O
of O
high O
grass O
and O
heaps O
of O
stones; O
strips O
of O
stubble O
land O
passed O
by O
them O
and O
still O
the O
same O
rooks, O
the O
same O
hawk, O
moving O
its O
wings O
with O
slow O
dignity, O
moved O
over O
the O
steppe. O
The O
air O
was O
more O
sultry O
than O
ever; O
from O
the O
sultry O
heat O
and O
the O
stillness O
submissive O
nature O
was O
spellbound O
into O
silence O
. O
. O
. O
. O
No O
wind, O
no O
fresh O
cheering O
sound, O
no O
cloud. O
But O
at O
last, O
when O
the O
sun O
was O
beginning O
to O
sink O
into O
the O
west, O
the O
steppe, O
the O
hills O
and O
the O
air O
could O
bear O
the O
oppression O
no O
longer, O
and, O
driven O
out O
of O
all O
patience, O
exhausted, O
tried O
to O
fling O
off O
the O
yoke. O
A O
fleecy O
ashen-grey O
cloud O
unexpectedly O
appeared O
behind O
the O
hills. O
It O
exchanged O
glances O
with O
the O
steppe, O
as O
though O
to O
say, O
"Here O
I O
am," O
and O
frowned. O
Suddenly O
something O
burst O
in O
the O
stagnant O
air; O
there O
was O
a O
violent O
squall O
of O
wind O
which O
whirled O
round O
and O
round, O
roaring O
and O
whistling O
over O
the O
steppe. O
At O
once O
a O
murmur O
rose O
from O
the O
grass O
and O
last O
year's O
dry O
herbage, O
the O
dust O
curled O
in O
spiral O
eddies O
over O
the O
road, O
raced O
over O
the O
steppe, O
and O
carrying O
with O
it O
straws, O
dragon O
flies O
and O
feathers, O
rose O
up O
in O
a O
whirling O
black O
column O
towards O
the O
sky O
and O
darkened O
the O
sun. O
Prickly O
uprooted O
plants O
ran O
stumbling O
and O
leaping O
in O
all O
directions O
over O
the O
steppe, O
and O
one O
of O
them O
got O
caught O
in O
the O
whirlwind, O
turned O
round O
and O
round O
like O
a O
bird, O
flew O
towards O
the O
sky, O
and O
turning O
into O
a O
little O
black O
speck, O
vanished O
from O
sight. O
After O
it O
flew O
another, O
and O
then O
a O
third, O
and O
Yegorushka O
saw O
two O
of O
them O
meet O
in O
the O
blue O
height O
and O
clutch O
at O
one O
another O
as O
though O
they O
were O
wrestling. O
A O
bustard O
flew O
up O
by O
the O
very O
road. O
Fluttering O
his O
wings O
and O
his O
tail, O
he O
looked, O
bathed O
in O
the O
sunshine, O
like O
an O
angler's O
glittering O
tin O
fish O
or O
a O
waterfly O
flashing O
so O
swiftly O
over O
the O
water O
that O
its O
wings O
cannot O
be O
told O
from O
its O
antenna, O
which O
seem O
to O
be O
growing O
before, O
behind O
and O
on O
all O
sides. O
. O
. O
. O
Quivering O
in O
the O
air O
like O
an O
insect O
with O
a O
shimmer O
of O
bright O
colours, O
the O
bustard O
flew O
high O
up O
in O
a O
straight O
line, O
then, O
probably O
frightened O
by O
a O
cloud O
of O
dust, O
swerved O
to O
one O
side, O
and O
for O
a O
long O
time O
the O
gleam O
of O
his O
wings O
could O
be O
seen. O
. O
. O
. O
Then O
a O
corncrake O
flew O
up O
from O
the O
grass, O
alarmed O
by O
the O
hurricane O
and O
not O
knowing O
what O
was O
the O
matter. O
It O
flew O
with O
the O
wind O
and O
not O
against O
it, O
like O
all O
the O
other O
birds, O
so O
that O
all O
its O
feathers O
were O
ruffled O
up O
and O
it O
was O
puffed O
out O
to O
the O
size O
of O
a O
hen O
and O
looked O
very O
angry O
and O
impressive. O
Only O
the O
rooks O
who O
had O
grown O
old O
on O
the O
steppe O
and O
were O
accustomed O
to O
its O
vagaries O
hovered O
calmly O
over O
the O
grass, O
or O
taking O
no O
notice O
of O
anything, O
went O
on O
unconcernedly O
pecking O
with O
their O
stout O
beaks O
at O
the O
hard O
earth. O
There O
was O
a O
dull O
roll O
of O
thunder O
beyond O
the O
hills; O
there O
came O
a O
whiff O
of O
fresh O
air. O
Deniska O
gave O
a O
cheerful O
whistle O
and O
lashed O
his O
horses. O
Father O
Christopher O
and O
Kuzmitchov O
held O
their O
hats O
and O
looked O
intently O
towards O
the O
hills. O
. O
. O
. O
How O
pleasant O
a O
shower O
of O
rain O
would O
have O
been! O
One O
effort, O
one O
struggle O
more, O
and O
it O
seemed O
the O
steppe O
would O
have O
got O
the O
upper O
hand. O
But O
the O
unseen O
oppressive O
force O
gradually O
riveted O
its O
fetters O
on O
the O
wind O
and O
the O
air, O
laid O
the O
dust, O
and O
the O
stillness O
came O
back O
again O
as O
though O
nothing O
had O
happened, O
the O
cloud O
hid, O
the O
sun-baked O
hills O
frowned O
submissively, O
the O
air O
grew O
calm, O
and O
only O
somewhere O
the O
troubled O
lapwings O
wailed O
and O
lamented O
their O
destiny. O
. O
. O
. O
Soon O
after O
that O
the O
evening O
came O
on. O
III O
In O
the O
dusk O
of O
evening O
a O
big O
house O
of O
one O
storey, O
with O
a O
rusty O
iron O
roof O
and O
with O
dark O
windows, O
came O
into O
sight. O
This O
house O
was O
called O
a O
posting-inn, O
though O
it O
had O
nothing O
like O
a O
stableyard, O
and O
it O
stood O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
steppe, O
with O
no O
kind O
of O
enclosure O
round O
it. O
A O
little O
to O
one O
side O
of O
it O
a O
wretched O
little O
cherry O
orchard O
shut O
in O
by O
a O
hurdle O
fence O
made O
a O
dark O
patch, O
and O
under O
the O
windows O
stood O
sleepy O
sunflowers O
drooping O
their O
heavy O
heads. O
From O
the O
orchard O
came O
the O
clatter O
of O
a O
little O
toy O
windmill, O
set O
there O
to O
frighten O
away O
hares O
by O
the O
rattle. O
Nothing O
more O
could O
be O
seen O
near O
the O
house, O
and O
nothing O
could O
be O
heard O
but O
the O
steppe. O
The O
chaise O
had O
scarcely O
stopped O
at O
the O
porch O
with O
an O
awning O
over O
it, O
when O
from O
the O
house O
there O
came O
the O
sound O
of O
cheerful O
voices, O
one O
a O
man's, O
another O
a O
woman's; O
there O
was O
the O
creak O
of O
a O
swing-door, O
and O
in O
a O
flash O
a O
tall O
gaunt O
figure, O
swinging O
its O
arms O
and O
fluttering O
its O
coat, O
was O
standing O
by O
the O
chaise. O
This O
was O
the O
innkeeper, O
Moisey O
Moisevitch, O
a O
man O
no O
longer O
young, O
with O
a O
very O
pale O
face O
and O
a O
handsome O
beard O
as O
black O
as O
charcoal. O
He O
was O
wearing O
a O
threadbare O
black O
coat, O
which O
hung O
flapping O
on O
his O
narrow O
shoulders O
as O
though O
on O
a O
hatstand, O
and O
fluttered O
its O
skirts O
like O
wings O
every O
time O
Moisey O
Moisevitch O
flung O
up O
his O
hands O
in O
delight O
or O
horror. O
Besides O
his O
coat O
the O
innkeeper O
was O
wearing O
full O
white O
trousers, O
not O
stuck O
into O
his O
boots, O
and O
a O
velvet O
waistcoat O
with O
brown O
flowers O
on O
it O
that O
looked O
like O
gigantic O
bugs. O
Moisey O
Moisevitch O
was O
at O
first O
dumb O
with O
excess O
of O
feeling O
on O
recognizing O
the O
travellers, O
then O
he O
clasped O
his O
hands O
and O
uttered O
a O
moan. O
His O
coat O
swung O
its O
skirts, O
his O
back O
bent O
into O
a O
bow, O
and O
his O
pale O
face O
twisted O
into O
a O
smile O
that O
suggested O
that O
to O
see O
the O
chaise O
was O
not O
merely O
a O
pleasure O
to O
him, O
but O
actually O
a O
joy O
so O
sweet O
as O
to O
be O
painful. O
"Oh O
dear! O
oh O
dear!" O
he O
began O
in O
a O
thin O
sing-song O
voice, O
breathless, O
fussing O
about O
and O
preventing O
the O
travellers O
from O
getting O
out O
of O
the O
chaise O
by O
his O
antics. O
"What O
a O
happy O
day O
for O
me! O
Oh, O
what O
am O
I O
to O
do O
now? O
Ivan O
Ivanitch! O
Father O
Christopher! O
What O
a O
pretty O
little O
gentleman O
sitting O
on O
the O
box, O
God O
strike O
me O
dead! O
Oh, O
my O
goodness! O
why O
am O
I O
standing O
here O
instead O
of O
asking O
the O
visitors O
indoors? O
Please O
walk O
in, O
I O
humbly O
beg O
you. O
. O
. O
. O
You O
are O
kindly O
welcome! O
Give O
me O
all O
your O
things. O
. O
. O
. O
Oh, O
my O
goodness O
me!" O
Moisey O
Moisevitch, O
who O
was O
rummaging O
in O
the O
chaise O
and O
assisting O
the O
travellers O
to O
alight, O
suddenly O
turned O
back O
and O
shouted O
in O
a O
voice O
as O
frantic O
and O
choking O
as O
though O
he O
were O
drowning O
and O
calling O
for O
help: O
"Solomon! O
Solomon!" O
"Solomon! O
Solomon!" O
a O
woman's O
voice O
repeated O
indoors. O
The O
swing-door O
creaked, O
and O
in O
the O
doorway O
appeared O
a O
rather O
short O
young O
Jew O
with O
a O
big O
beak-like O
nose, O
with O
a O
bald O
patch O
surrounded O
by O
rough O
red O
curly O
hair; O
he O
was O
dressed O
in O
a O
short O
and O
very O
shabby O
reefer O
jacket, O
with O
rounded O
lappets O
and O
short O
sleeves, O
and O
in O
short O
serge O
trousers, O
so O
that O
he O
looked O
skimpy O
and O
short-tailed O
like O
an O
unfledged O
bird. O
This O
was O
Solomon, O
the O
brother O
of O
Moisey O
Moisevitch. O
He O
went O
up O
to O
the O
chaise, O
smiling O
rather O
queerly, O
and O
did O
not O
speak O
or O
greet O
the O
travellers. O
"Ivan O
Ivanitch O
and O
Father O
Christopher O
have O
come," O
said O
Moisey O
Moisevitch O
in O
a O
tone O
as O
though O
he O
were O
afraid O
his O
brother O
would O
not O
believe O
him. O
"Dear, O
dear! O
What O
a O
surprise! O
Such O
honoured O
guests O
to O
have O
come O
us O
so O
suddenly! O
Come, O
take O
their O
things, O
Solomon. O
Walk O
in, O
honoured O
guests." O
A O
little O
later O
Kuzmitchov, O
Father O
Christopher, O
and O
Yegorushka O
were O
sitting O
in O
a O
big O
gloomy O
empty O
room O
at O
an O
old O
oak O
table. O
The O
table O
was O
almost O
in O
solitude, O
for, O
except O
a O
wide O
sofa O
covered O
with O
torn O
American O
leather O
and O
three O
chairs, O
there O
was O
no O
other O
furniture O
in O
the O
room. O
And, O
indeed, O
not O
everybody O
would O
have O
given O
the O
chairs O
that O
name. O
They O
were O
a O
pitiful O
semblance O
of O
furniture, O
covered O
with O
American O
leather O
that O
had O
seen O
its O
best O
days, O
and O
with O
backs O
bent O
backwards O
at O
an O
unnaturally O
acute O
angle, O
so O
that O
they O
looked O
like O
children's O
sledges. O
It O
was O
hard O
to O
imagine O
what O
had O
been O
the O
unknown O
carpenter's O
object O
in O
bending O
the O
chairbacks O
so O
mercilessly, O
and O
one O
was O
tempted O
to O
imagine O
that O
it O
was O
not O
the O
carpenter's O
fault, O
but O
that O
some O
athletic O
visitor O
had O
bent O
the O
chairs O
like O
this O
as O
a O
feat, O
then O
had O
tried O
to O
bend O
them O
back O
again O
and O
had O
made O
them O
worse. O
The O
room O
looked O
gloomy, O
the O
walls O
were O
grey, O
the O
ceilings O
and O
the O
cornices O
were O
grimy; O
on O
the O
floor O
were O
chinks O
and O
yawning O
holes O
that O
were O
hard O
to O
account O
for O
(one O
might O
have O
fancied O
they O
were O
made O
by O
the O
heel O
of O
the O
same O
athlete), O
and O
it O
seemed O
as O
though O
the O
room O
would O
still O
have O
been O
dark O
if O
a O
dozen O
lamps O
had O
hung O
in O
it. O
There O
was O
nothing O
approaching O
an O
ornament O
on O
the O
walls O
or O
the O
windows. O
On O
one O
wall, O
however, O
there O
hung O
a O
list O
of O
regulations O
of O
some O
sort O
under O
a O
two-headed O
eagle O
in O
a O
grey O
wooden O
frame, O
and O
on O
another O
wall O
in O
the O
same O
sort O
of O
frame O
an O
engraving O
with O
the O
inscription, O
"The O
Indifference O
of O
Man." O
What O
it O
was O
to O
which O
men O
were O
indifferent O
it O
was O
impossible O
to O
make O
out, O
as O
the O
engraving O
was O
very O
dingy O
with O
age O
and O
was O
extensively O
flyblown. O
There O
was O
a O
smell O
of O
something O
decayed O
and O
sour O
in O
the O
room. O
As O
he O
led O
the O
visitors O
into O
the O
room, O
Moisey O
Moisevitch O
went O
on O
wriggling, O
gesticulating, O
shrugging O
and O
uttering O
joyful O
exclamations; O
he O
considered O
these O
antics O
necessary O
in O
order O
to O
seem O
polite O
and O
agreeable. O
"When O
did O
our O
waggons O
go O
by?" O
Kuzmitchov O
asked. O
"One O
party O
went O
by O
early O
this O
morning, O
and O
the O
other, O
Ivan O
Ivanitch, O
put O
up O
here O
for O
dinner O
and O
went O
on O
towards O
evening." O
"Ah! O
. O
. O
. O
Has O
Varlamov O
been O
by O
or O
not?" O
"No, O
Ivan O
Ivanitch. O
His O
clerk, O
Grigory O
Yegoritch, O
went O
by O
yesterday O
morning O
and O
said O
that O
he O
had O
to O
be O
to-day O
at O
the O
Molokans' O
farm." O
"Good! O
so O
we O
will O
go O
after O
the O
waggons O
directly O
and O
then O
on O
to O
the O
Molokans'." O
"Mercy O
on O
us, O
Ivan O
Ivanitch!" O
Moisey O
Moisevitch O
cried O
in O
horror, O
flinging O
up O
his O
hands. O
"Where O
are O
you O
going O
for O
the O
night? O
You O
will O
have O
a O
nice O
little O
supper O
and O
stay O
the O
night, O
and O
to-morrow O
morning, O
please O
God, O
you O
can O
go O
on O
and O
overtake O
anyone O
you O
like." O
"There O
is O
no O
time O
for O
that. O
. O
. O
. O
Excuse O
me, O
Moisey O
Moisevitch, O
another O
time; O
but O
now O
I O
must O
make O
haste. O
We'll O
stay O
a O
quarter O
of O
an O
hour O
and O
then O
go O
on; O
we O
can O
stay O
the O
night O
at O
the O
Molokans'." O
"A O
quarter O
of O
an O
hour!" O
squealed O
Moisey O
Moisevitch. O
"Have O
you O
no O
fear O
of O
God, O
Ivan O
Ivanitch? O
You O
will O
compel O
me O
to O
hide O
your O
caps O
and O
lock O
the O
door! O
You O
must O
have O
a O
cup O
of O
tea O
and O
a O
snack O
of O
something, O
anyway." O
"We O
have O
no O
time O
for O
tea," O
said O
Kuzmitchov. O
Moisey O
Moisevitch O
bent O
his O
head O
on O
one O
side, O
crooked O
his O
knees, O
and O
put O
his O
open O
hands O
before O
him O
as O
though O
warding O
off O
a O
blow, O
while O
with O
a O
smile O
of O
agonized O
sweetness O
he O
began O
imploring: O
"Ivan O
Ivanitch! O
Father O
Christopher! O
Do O
be O
so O
good O
as O
to O
take O
a O
cup O
of O
tea O
with O
me. O
Surely O
I O
am O
not O
such O
a O
bad O
man O
that O
you O
can't O
even O
drink O
tea O
in O
my O
house? O
Ivan O
Ivanitch!" O
"Well, O
we O
may O
just O
as O
well O
have O
a O
cup O
of O
tea," O
said O
Father O
Christopher, O
with O
a O
sympathetic O
smile; O
"that O
won't O
keep O
us O
long." O
"Very O
well," O
Kuzmitchov O
assented. O
Moisey O
Moisevitch, O
in O
a O
fluster O
uttered O
an O
exclamation O
of O
joy, O
and O
shrugging O
as O
though O
he O
had O
just O
stepped O
out O
of O
cold O
weather O
into O
warm, O
ran O
to O
the O
door O
and O
cried O
in O
the O
same O
frantic O
voice O
in O
which O
he O
had O
called O
Solomon: O
"Rosa! O
Rosa! O
Bring O
the O
samovar!" O
A O
minute O
later O
the O
door O
opened, O
and O
Solomon O
came O
into O
the O
room O
carrying O
a O
large O
tray O
in O
his O
hands. O
Setting O
the O
tray O
on O
the O
table, O
he O
looked O
away O
sarcastically O
with O
the O
same O
queer O
smile O
as O
before. O
Now, O
by O
the O
light O
of O
the O
lamp, O
it O
was O
possible O
to O
see O
his O
smile O
distinctly; O
it O
was O
very O
complex, O
and O
expressed O
a O
variety O
of O
emotions, O
but O
the O
predominant O
element O
in O
it O
was O
undisguised O
contempt. O
He O
seemed O
to O
be O
thinking O
of O
something O
ludicrous O
and O
silly, O
to O
be O
feeling O
contempt O
and O
dislike, O
to O
be O
pleased O
at O
something O
and O
waiting O
for O
the O
favourable O
moment O
to O
turn O
something O
into O
ridicule O
and O
to O
burst O
into O
laughter. O
His O
long O
nose, O
his O
thick O
lips, O
and O
his O
sly O
prominent O
eyes O
seemed O
tense O
with O
the O
desire O
to O
laugh. O
Looking O
at O
his O
face, O
Kuzmitchov O
smiled O
ironically O
and O
asked: O
"Solomon, O
why O
did O
you O
not O
come O
to O
our O
fair O
at O
N. O
this O
summer, O
and O
act O
some O
Jewish O
scenes?" O
Two O
years O
before, O
as O
Yegorushka O
remembered O
very O
well, O
at O
one O
of O
the O
booths O
at O
the O
fair O
at O
N., O
Solomon O
had O
performed O
some O
scenes O
of O
Jewish O
life, O
and O
his O
acting O
had O
been O
a O
great O
success. O
The O
allusion O
to O
this O
made O
no O
impression O
whatever O
upon O
Solomon. O
Making O
no O
answer, O
he O
went O
out O
and O
returned O
a O
little O
later O
with O
the O
samovar. O
When O
he O
had O
done O
what O
he O
had O
to O
do O
at O
the O
table O
he O
moved O
a O
little O
aside, O
and, O
folding O
his O
arms O
over O
his O
chest O
and O
thrusting O
out O
one O
leg, O
fixed O
his O
sarcastic O
eyes O
on O
Father O
Christopher. O
There O
was O
something O
defiant, O
haughty, O
and O
contemptuous O
in O
his O
attitude, O
and O
at O
the O
same O
time O
it O
was O
comic O
and O
pitiful O
in O
the O
extreme, O
because O
the O
more O
impressive O
his O
attitude O
the O
more O
vividly O
it O
showed O
up O
his O
short O
trousers, O
his O
bobtail O
coat, O
his O
caricature O
of O
a O
nose, O
and O
his O
bird-like O
plucked-looking O
little O
figure. O
Moisey O
Moisevitch O
brought O
a O
footstool O
from O
the O
other O
room O
and O
sat O
down O
a O
little O
way O
from O
the O
table. O
"I O
wish O
you O
a O
good O
appetite! O
Tea O
and O
sugar!" O
he O
began, O
trying O
to O
entertain O
his O
visitors. O
"I O
hope O
you O
will O
enjoy O
it. O
Such O
rare O
guests, O
such O
rare O
ones; O
it O
is O
years O
since O
I O
last O
saw O
Father O
Christopher. O
And O
will O
no O
one O
tell O
me O
who O
is O
this O
nice O
little O
gentleman?" O
he O
asked, O
looking O
tenderly O
at O
Yegorushka. O
"He O
is O
the O
son O
of O
my O
sister, O
Olga O
Ivanovna," O
answered O
Kuzmitchov. O
"And O
where O
is O
he O
going?" O
"To O
school. O
We O
are O
taking O
him O
to O
a O
high O
school." O
In O
his O
politeness, O
Moisey O
Moisevitch O
put O
on O
a O
look O
of O
wonder O
and O
wagged O
his O
head O
expressively. O
"Ah, O
that O
is O
a O
fine O
thing," O
he O
said, O
shaking O
his O
finger O
at O
the O
samovar. O
"That's O
a O
fine O
thing. O
You O
will O
come O
back O
from O
the O
high O
school O
such O
a O
gentleman O
that O
we O
shall O
all O
take O
off O
our O
hats O
to O
you. O
You O
will O
be O
wealthy O
and O
wise O
and O
so O
grand O
that O
your O
mamma O
will O
be O
delighted. O
Oh, O
that's O
a O
fine O
thing!" O
He O
paused O
a O
little, O
stroked O
his O
knees, O
and O
began O
again O
in O
a O
jocose O
and O
deferential O
tone. O
"You O
must O
excuse O
me, O
Father O
Christopher, O
but O
I O
am O
thinking O
of O
writing O
to O
the O
bishop O
to O
tell O
him O
you O
are O
robbing O
the O
merchants O
of O
their O
living. O
I O
shall O
take O
a O
sheet O
of O
stamped O
paper O
and O
write O
that O
I O
suppose O
Father O
Christopher O
is O
short O
of O
pence, O
as O
he O
has O
taken O
up O
with O
trade O
and O
begun O
selling O
wool." O
"H'm, O
yes O
. O
. O
. O
it's O
a O
queer O
notion O
in O
my O
old O
age," O
said O
Father O
Christopher, O
and O
he O
laughed. O
"I O
have O
turned O
from O
priest O
to O
merchant, O
brother. O
I O
ought O
to O
be O
at O
home O
now O
saying O
my O
prayers, O
instead O
of O
galloping O
about O
the O
country O
like O
a O
Pharaoh O
in O
his O
chariot. O
. O
. O
. O
Vanity!" O
"But O
it O
will O
mean O
a O
lot O
of O
pence!" O
"Oh, O
I O
dare O
say! O
More O
kicks O
than O
halfpence, O
and O
serve O
me O
right. O
The O
wool's O
not O
mine, O
but O
my O
son-in-law O
MikhailÕs!" O
"Why O
doesn't O
he O
go O
himself?" O
"Why, O
because O
. O
. O
. O
His O
mother's O
milk O
is O
scarcely O
dry O
upon O
his O
lips. O
He O
can O
buy O
wool O
all O
right, O
but O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
selling, O
he O
has O
no O
sense; O
he O
is O
young O
yet. O
He O
has O
wasted O
all O
his O
money; O
he O
wanted O
to O
grow O
rich O
and O
cut O
a O
dash, O
but O
he O
tried O
here O
and O
there, O
and O
no O
one O
would O
give O
him O
his O
price. O
And O
so O
the O
lad O
went O
on O
like O
that O
for O
a O
year, O
and O
then O
he O
came O
to O
me O
and O
said, O
'Daddy, O
you O
sell O
the O
wool O
for O
me; O
be O
kind O
and O
do O
it! O
I O
am O
no O
good O
at O
the O
business!' O
And O
that O
is O
true O
enough. O
As O
soon O
as O
there O
is O
anything O
wrong O
then O
it's O
'Daddy,' O
but O
till O
then O
they O
could O
get O
on O
without O
their O
dad. O
When O
he O
was O
buying O
he O
did O
not O
consult O
me, O
but O
now O
when O
he O
is O
in O
difficulties O
it's O
Daddy's O
turn. O
And O
what O
does O
his O
dad O
know O
about O
it? O
If O
it O
were O
not O
for O
Ivan O
Ivanitch, O
his O
dad O
could O
do O
nothing. O
I O
have O
a O
lot O
of O
worry O
with O
them." O
"Yes; O
one O
has O
a O
lot O
of O
worry O
with O
one's O
children, O
I O
can O
tell O
you O
that," O
sighed O
Moisey O
Moisevitch. O
"I O
have O
six O
of O
my O
own. O
One O
needs O
schooling, O
another O
needs O
doctoring, O
and O
a O
third O
needs O
nursing, O
and O
when O
they O
grow O
up O
they O
are O
more O
trouble O
still. O
It O
is O
not O
only O
nowadays, O
it O
was O
the O
same O
in O
Holy O
Scripture. O
When O
Jacob O
had O
little O
children O
he O
wept, O
and O
when O
they O
grew O
up O
he O
wept O
still O
more O
bitterly." O
"H'm, O
yes O
. O
. O
." O
Father O
Christopher O
assented O
pensively, O
looking O
at O
his O
glass. O
"I O
have O
no O
cause O
myself O
to O
rail O
against O
the O
Lord. O
I O
have O
lived O
to O
the O
end O
of O
my O
days O
as O
any O
man O
might O
be O
thankful O
to O
live. O
. O
. O
. O
I O
have O
married O
my O
daughters O
to O
good O
men, O
my O
sons O
I O
have O
set O
up O
in O
life, O
and O
now O
I O
am O
free; O
I O
have O
done O
my O
work O
and O
can O
go O
where O
I O
like. O
I O
live O
in O
peace O
with O
my O
wife. O
I O
eat O
and O
drink O
and O
sleep O
and O
rejoice O
in O
my O
grandchildren, O
and O
say O
my O
prayers O
and O
want O
nothing O
more. O
I O
live O
on O
the O
fat O
of O
the O
land, O
and O
don't O
need O
to O
curry O
favour O
with O
anyone. O
I O
have O
never O
had O
any O
trouble O
from O
childhood, O
and O
now O
suppose O
the O
Tsar O
were O
to O
ask O
me, O
'What O
do O
you O
need? O
What O
would O
you O
like?' O
why, O
I O
don't O
need O
anything. O
I O
have O
everything O
I O
want O
and O
everything O
to O
be O
thankful O
for. O
In O
the O
whole O
town O
there O
is O
no O
happier O
man O
than O
I O
am. O
My O
only O
trouble O
is O
I O
have O
so O
many O
sins, O
but O
there O
--only O
God O
is O
without O
sin. O
That's O
right, O
isn't O
it?" O
"No O
doubt O
it O
is." O
"I O
have O
no O
teeth, O
of O
course; O
my O
poor O
old O
back O
aches; O
there O
is O
one O
thing O
and O
another, O
. O
. O
. O
asthma O
and O
that O
sort O
of O
thing. O
. O
. O
. O
I O
ache. O
. O
. O
. O
The O
flesh O
is O
weak, O
but O
then O
think O
of O
my O
age! O
I O
am O
in O
the O
eighties! O
One O
can't O
go O
on O
for O
ever; O
one O
mustn't O
outstay O
one's O
welcome." O
Father O
Christopher O
suddenly O
thought O
of O
something, O
spluttered O
into O
his O
glass O
and O
choked O
with O
laughter. O
Moisey O
Moisevitch O
laughed, O
too, O
from O
politeness, O
and O
he, O
too, O
cleared O
his O
throat. O
"So O
funny!" O
said O
Father O
Christopher, O
and O
he O
waved O
his O
hand. O
"My O
eldest O
son O
Gavrila O
came O
to O
pay O
me O
a O
visit. O
He O
is O
in O
the O
medical O
line, O
and O
is O
a O
district O
doctor O
in O
the O
province O
of O
Tchernigov. O
. O
. O
. O
'Very O
well O
. O
. O
.' O
I O
said O
to O
him, O
'here O
I O
have O
asthma O
and O
one O
thing O
and O
another. O
. O
. O
. O
You O
are O
a O
doctor; O
cure O
your O
father!' O
He O
undressed O
me O
on O
the O
spot, O
tapped O
me, O
listened, O
and O
all O
sorts O
of O
tricks, O
. O
. O
. O
kneaded O
my O
stomach, O
and O
then O
he O
said, O
'Dad, O
you O
ought O
to O
be O
treated O
with O
compressed O
air.'" O
Father O
Christopher O
laughed O
convulsively, O
till O
the O
tears O
came O
into O
his O
eyes, O
and O
got O
up. O
"And O
I O
said O
to O
him, O
'God O
bless O
your O
compressed O
air!'" O
he O
brought O
out O
through O
his O
laughter, O
waving O
both O
hands. O
"God O
bless O
your O
compressed O
air!" O
Moisey O
Moisevitch O
got O
up, O
too, O
and O
with O
his O
hands O
on O
his O
stomach, O
went O
off O
into O
shrill O
laughter O
like O
the O
yap O
of O
a O
lap-dog. O
"God O
bless O
the O
compressed O
air!" O
repeated O
Father O
Christopher, O
laughing. O
Moisey O
Moisevitch O
laughed O
two O
notes O
higher O
and O
so O
violently O
that O
he O
could O
hardly O
stand O
on O
his O
feet. O
"Oh O
dear!" O
he O
moaned O
through O
his O
laughter. O
"Let O
me O
get O
my O
breath O
. O
. O
. O
. O
You'll O
be O
the O
death O
of O
me." O
He O
laughed O
and O
talked, O
though O
at O
the O
same O
time O
he O
was O
casting O
timorous O
and O
suspicious O
looks O
at O
Solomon. O
The O
latter O
was O
standing O
in O
the O
same O
attitude O
and O
still O
smiling. O
To O
judge O
from O
his O
eyes O
and O
his O
smile, O
his O
contempt O
and O
hatred O
were O
genuine, O
but O
that O
was O
so O
out O
of O
keeping O
with O
his O
plucked-looking O
figure O
that O
it O
seemed O
to O
Yegorushka O
as O
though O
he O
were O
putting O
on O
his O
defiant O
attitude O
and O
biting O
sarcastic O
smile O
to O
play O
the O
fool O
for O
the O
entertainment O
of O
their O
honoured O
guests. O
After O
drinking O
six O
glasses O
of O
tea O
in O
silence, O
Kuzmitchov O
cleared O
a O
space O
before O
him O
on O
the O
table, O
took O
his O
bag, O
the O
one O
which O
he O
kept O
under O
his O
head O
when O
he O
slept O
under O
the O
chaise, O
untied O
the O
string O
and O
shook O
it. O
Rolls O
of O
paper O
notes O
were O
scattered O
out O
of O
the O
bag O
on O
the O
table. O
"While O
we O
have O
the O
time, O
Father O
Christopher, O
let O
us O
reckon O
up," O
said O
Kuzmitchov. O
Moisey O
Moisevitch O
was O
embarrassed O
at O
the O
sight O
of O
the O
money. O
He O
got O
up, O
and, O
as O
a O
man O
of O
delicate O
feeling O
unwilling O
to O
pry O
into O
other O
people's O
secrets, O
he O
went O
out O
of O
the O
room O
on O
tiptoe, O
swaying O
his O
arms. O
Solomon O
remained O
where O
he O
was. O
"How O
many O
are O
there O
in O
the O
rolls O
of O
roubles?" O
Father O
Christopher O
began. O
"The O
rouble O
notes O
are O
done O
up O
in O
fifties, O
. O
. O
. O
the O
three-rouble O
notes O
in O
nineties, O
the O
twenty-five O
and O
hundred O
roubles O
in O
thousands. O
You O
count O
out O
seven O
thousand O
eight O
hundred O
for O
Varlamov, O
and O
I O
will O
count O
out O
for O
Gusevitch. O
And O
mind O
you O
don't O
make O
a O
mistake. O
. O
." O
Yegorushka O
had O
never O
in O
his O
life O
seen O
so O
much O
money O
as O
was O
lying O
on O
the O
table O
before O
him. O
There O
must O
have O
been O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
money, O
for O
the O
roll O
of O
seven O
thousand O
eight O
hundred, O
which O
Father O
Christopher O
put O
aside O
for O
Varlamov, O
seemed O
very O
small O
compared O
with O
the O
whole O
heap. O
At O
any O
other O
time O
such O
a O
mass O
of O
money O
would O
have O
impressed O
Yegorushka, O
and O
would O
have O
moved O
him O
to O
reflect O
how O
many O
cracknels, O
buns O
and O
poppy-cakes O
could O
be O
bought O
for O
that O
money. O
Now O
he O
looked O
at O
it O
listlessly, O
only O
conscious O
of O
the O
disgusting O
smell O
of O
kerosene O
and O
rotten O
apples O
that O
came O
from O
the O
heap O
of O
notes. O
He O
was O
exhausted O
by O
the O
jolting O
ride O
in O
the O
chaise, O
tired O
out O
and O
sleepy. O
His O
head O
was O
heavy, O
his O
eyes O
would O
hardly O
keep O
open O
and O
his O
thoughts O
were O
tangled O
like O
threads. O
If O
it O
had O
been O
possible O
he O
would O
have O
been O
relieved O
to O
lay O
his O
head O
on O
the O
table, O
so O
as O
not O
to O
see O
the O
lamp O
and O
the O
fingers O
moving O
over O
the O
heaps O
of O
notes, O
and O
to O
have O
let O
his O
tired O
sleepy O
thoughts O
go O
still O
more O
at O
random. O
When O
he O
tried O
to O
keep O
awake, O
the O
light O
of O
the O
lamp, O
the O
cups O
and O
the O
fingers O
grew O
double, O
the O
samovar O
heaved O
and O
the O
smell O
of O
rotten O
apples O
seemed O
even O
more O
acrid O
and O
disgusting. O
"Ah, O
money, O
money!" O
sighed O
Father O
Christopher, O
smiling. O
"You O
bring O
trouble! O
Now O
I O
expect O
my O
Mihailo O
is O
asleep O
and O
dreaming O
that O
I O
am O
going O
to O
bring O
him O
a O
heap O
of O
money O
like O
this." O
"Your O
Mihailo O
Timofevitch O
is O
a O
man O
who O
doesn't O
understand O
business," O
said O
Kuzmitchov O
in O
an O
undertone; O
"he O
undertakes O
what O
isn't O
his O
work, O
but O
you O
understand O
and O
can O
judge. O
You O
had O
better O
hand O
over O
your O
wool O
to O
me, O
as O
I O
have O
said O
already, O
and O
I O
would O
give O
you O
half O
a O
rouble O
above O
my O
own O
price-- O
yes, O
I O
would, O
simply O
out O
of O
regard O
for O
you. O
. O
. O
." O
"No, O
Ivan O
Ivanitch." O
Father O
Christopher O
sighed. O
"I O
thank O
you O
for O
your O
kindness. O
. O
. O
. O
Of O
course, O
if O
it O
were O
for O
me O
to O
decide, O
I O
shouldn't O
think O
twice O
about O
it; O
but O
as O
it O
is, O
the O
wool O
is O
not O
mine, O
as O
you O
know. O
. O
. O
." O
Moisey O
Moisevitch O
came O
in O
on O
tiptoe. O
Trying O
from O
delicacy O
not O
to O
look O
at O
the O
heaps O
of O
money, O
he O
stole O
up O
to O
Yegorushka O
and O
pulled O
at O
his O
shirt O
from O
behind. O
"Come O
along, O
little O
gentleman," O
he O
said O
in O
an O
undertone, O
"come O
and O
see O
the O
little O
bear O
I O
can O
show O
you! O
Such O
a O
queer, O
cross O
little O
bear. O
Oo-oo!" O
The O
sleepy O
boy O
got O
up O
and O
listlessly O
dragged O
himself O
after O
Moisey O
Moisevitch O
to O
see O
the O
bear. O
He O
went O
into O
a O
little O
room, O
where, O
before O
he O
saw O
anything, O
he O
felt O
he O
could O
not O
breathe O
from O
the O
smell O
of O
something O
sour O
and O
decaying, O
which O
was O
much O
stronger O
here O
than O
in O
the O
big O
room O
and O
probably O
spread O
from O
this O
room O
all O
over O
the O
house. O
One O
part O
of O
the O
room O
was O
occupied O
by O
a O
big O
bed, O
covered O
with O
a O
greasy O
quilt O
and O
another O
by O
a O
chest O
of O
drawers O
and O
heaps O
of O
rags O
of O
all O
kinds O
from O
a O
woman's O
stiff O
petticoat O
to O
children's O
little O
breeches O
and O
braces. O
A O
tallow O
candle O
stood O
on O
the O
chest O
of O
drawers. O
Instead O
of O
the O
promised O
bear, O
Yegorushka O
saw O
a O
big O
fat O
Jewess O
with O
her O
hair O
hanging O
loose, O
in O
a O
red O
flannel O
skirt O
with O
black O
sprigs O
on O
it; O
she O
turned O
with O
difficulty O
in O
the O
narrow O
space O
between O
the O
bed O
and O
the O
chest O
of O
drawers O
and O
uttered O
drawn-out O
moaning O
as O
though O
she O
had O
toothache. O
On O
seeing O
Yegorushka, O
she O
made O
a O
doleful, O
woe-begone O
face, O
heaved O
a O
long O
drawn-out O
sigh, O
and O
before O
he O
had O
time O
to O
look O
round, O
put O
to O
his O
lips O
a O
slice O
of O
bread O
smeared O
with O
honey. O
"Eat O
it, O
dearie, O
eat O
it!" O
she O
said. O
"You O
are O
here O
without O
your O
mamma, O
and O
no O
one O
to O
look O
after O
you. O
Eat O
it O
up." O
Yegorushka O
did O
eat O
it, O
though O
after O
the O
goodies O
and O
poppy-cakes O
he O
had O
every O
day O
at O
home, O
he O
did O
not O
think O
very O
much O
of O
the O
honey, O
which O
was O
mixed O
with O
wax O
and O
bees' O
wings. O
He O
ate O
while O
Moisey O
Moisevitch O
and O
the O
Jewess O
looked O
at O
him O
and O
sighed. O
"Where O
are O
you O
going, O
dearie?" O
asked O
the O
Jewess. O
"To O
school," O
answered O
Yegorushka. O
"And O
how O
many O
brothers O
and O
sisters O
have O
you O
got?" O
"I O
am O
the O
only O
one; O
there O
are O
no O
others." O
"O-oh!" O
sighed O
the O
Jewess, O
and O
turned O
her O
eyes O
upward. O
"Poor O
mamma, O
poor O
mamma! O
How O
she O
will O
weep O
and O
miss O
you! O
We O
are O
going O
to O
send O
our O
Nahum O
to O
school O
in O
a O
year. O
O-oh!" O
"Ah, O
Nahum, O
Nahum!" O
sighed O
Moisey O
Moisevitch, O
and O
the O
skin O
of O
his O
pale O
face O
twitched O
nervously. O
"And O
he O
is O
so O
delicate." O
The O
greasy O
quilt O
quivered, O
and O
from O
beneath O
it O
appeared O
a O
child's O
curly O
head O
on O
a O
very O
thin O
neck; O
two O
black O
eyes O
gleamed O
and O
stared O
with O
curiosity O
at O
Yegorushka. O
Still O
sighing, O
Moisey O
Moisevitch O
and O
the O
Jewess O
went O
to O
the O
chest O
of O
drawers O
and O
began O
talking O
in O
Yiddish. O
Moisey O
Moisevitch O
spoke O
in O
a O
low O
bass O
undertone, O
and O
altogether O
his O
talk O
in O
Yiddish O
was O
like O
a O
continual O
"ghaal-ghaal-ghaal-ghaal, O
. O
. O
." O
while O
his O
wife O
answered O
him O
in O
a O
shrill O
voice O
like O
a O
turkeycock's, O
and O
the O
whole O
effect O
of O
her O
talk O
was O
something O
like O
"Too-too-too-too!" O
While O
they O
were O
consulting, O
another O
little O
curly O
head O
on O
a O
thin O
neck O
peeped O
out O
of O
the O
greasy O
quilt, O
then O
a O
third, O
then O
a O
fourth. O
. O
. O
. O
If O
Yegorushka O
had O
had O
a O
fertile O
imagination O
he O
might O
have O
imagined O
that O
the O
hundred-headed O
hydra O
was O
hiding O
under O
the O
quilt. O
"Ghaal-ghaal-ghaal-ghaal!" O
said O
Moisey O
Moisevitch. O
"Too-too-too-too!" O
answered O
the O
Jewess. O
The O
consultation O
ended O
in O
the O
Jewess's O
diving O
with O
a O
deep O
sigh O
into O
the O
chest O
of O
drawers, O
and, O
unwrapping O
some O
sort O
of O
green O
rag O
there, O
she O
took O
out O
a O
big O
rye O
cake O
made O
in O
the O
shape O
of O
a O
heart. O
"Take O
it, O
dearie," O
she O
said, O
giving O
Yegorushka O
the O
cake; O
"you O
have O
no O
mamma O
now-- O
no O
one O
to O
give O
you O
nice O
things." O
Yegorushka O
stuck O
the O
cake O
in O
his O
pocket O
and O
staggered O
to O
the O
door, O
as O
he O
could O
not O
go O
on O
breathing O
the O
foul, O
sour O
air O
in O
which O
the O
innkeeper O
and O
his O
wife O
lived. O
Going O
back O
to O
the O
big O
room, O
he O
settled O
himself O
more O
comfortably O
on O
the O
sofa O
and O
gave O
up O
trying O
to O
check O
his O
straying O
thoughts. O
As O
soon O
as O
Kuzmitchov O
had O
finished O
counting O
out O
the O
notes O
he O
put O
them O
back O
into O
the O
bag. O
He O
did O
not O
treat O
them O
very O
respectfully O
and O
stuffed O
them O
into O
the O
dirty O
sack O
without O
ceremony, O
as O
indifferently O
as O
though O
they O
had O
not O
been O
money O
but O
waste O
paper. O
Father O
Christopher O
was O
talking O
to O
Solomon. O
"Well, O
Solomon O
the O
Wise!" O
he O
said, O
yawning O
and O
making O
the O
sign O
of O
the O
cross O
over O
his O
mouth. O
"How O
is O
business?" O
"What O
sort O
of O
business O
are O
you O
talking O
about?" O
asked O
Solomon, O
and O
he O
looked O
as O
fiendish, O
as O
though O
it O
were O
a O
hint O
of O
some O
crime O
on O
his O
part. O
"Oh, O
things O
in O
general. O
What O
are O
you O
doing?" O
"What O
am O
I O
doing?" O
Solomon O
repeated, O
and O
he O
shrugged O
his O
shoulders. O
"The O
same O
as O
everyone O
else. O
. O
. O
. O
You O
see, O
I O
am O
a O
menial, O
I O
am O
my O
brother's O
servant; O
my O
brother's O
the O
servant O
of O
the O
visitors; O
the O
visitors O
are O
Varlamov's O
servants; O
and O
if O
I O
had O
ten O
millions, O
Varlamov O
would O
be O
my O
servant." O
"Why O
would O
he O
be O
your O
servant?" O
"Why, O
because O
there O
isn't O
a O
gentleman O
or O
millionaire O
who O
isn't O
ready O
to O
lick O
the O
hand O
of O
a O
scabby O
Jew O
for O
the O
sake O
of O
making O
a O
kopeck. O
Now, O
I O
am O
a O
scabby O
Jew O
and O
a O
beggar. O
Everybody O
looks O
at O
me O
as O
though O
I O
were O
a O
dog, O
but O
if O
I O
had O
money O
Varlamov O
would O
play O
the O
fool O
before O
me O
just O
as O
Moisey O
does O
before O
you." O
Father O
Christopher O
and O
Kuzmitchov O
looked O
at O
each O
other. O
Neither O
of O
them O
understood O
Solomon. O
Kuzmitchov O
looked O
at O
him O
sternly O
and O
dryly, O
and O
asked: O
"How O
can O
you O
compare O
yourself O
with O
Varlamov, O
you O
blockhead?" O
"I O
am O
not O
such O
a O
fool O
as O
to O
put O
myself O
on O
a O
level O
with O
Varlamov," O
answered O
Solomon, O
looking O
sarcastically O
at O
the O
speaker. O
"Though O
Varlamov O
is O
a O
Russian, O
he O
is O
at O
heart O
a O
scabby O
Jew; O
money O
and O
gain O
are O
all O
he O
lives O
for, O
but O
I O
threw O
my O
money O
in O
the O
stove! O
I O
don't O
want O
money, O
or O
land, O
or O
sheep, O
and O
there O
is O
no O
need O
for O
people O
to O
be O
afraid O
of O
me O
and O
to O
take O
off O
their O
hats O
when O
I O
pass. O
So O
I O
am O
wiser O
than O
your O
Varlamov O
and O
more O
like O
a O
man!" O
A O
little O
later O
Yegorushka, O
half O
asleep, O
heard O
Solomon O
in O
a O
hoarse O
hollow O
voice O
choked O
with O
hatred, O
in O
hurried O
stuttering O
phrases, O
talking O
about O
the O
Jews. O
At O
first O
he O
talked O
correctly O
in O
Russian, O
then O
he O
fell O
into O
the O
tone O
of O
a O
Jewish O
recitation, O
and O
began O
speaking O
as O
he O
had O
done O
at O
the O
fair O
with O
an O
exaggerated O
Jewish O
accent. O
"Stop! O
. O
. O
." O
Father O
Christopher O
said O
to O
him. O
"If O
you O
don't O
like O
your O
religion O
you O
had O
better O
change O
it, O
but O
to O
laugh O
at O
it O
is O
a O
sin; O
it O
is O
only O
the O
lowest O
of O
the O
low O
who O
will O
make O
fun O
of O
his O
religion." O
"You O
don't O
understand," O
Solomon O
cut O
him O
short O
rudely. O
"I O
am O
talking O
of O
one O
thing O
and O
you O
are O
talking O
of O
something O
else. O
. O
. O
." O
"One O
can O
see O
you O
are O
a O
foolish O
fellow," O
sighed O
Father O
Christopher. O
"I O
admonish O
you O
to O
the O
best O
of O
my O
ability, O
and O
you O
are O
angry. O
I O
speak O
to O
you O
like O
an O
old O
man O
quietly, O
and O
you O
answer O
like O
a O
turkeycock: O
'Bla-- O
bla-- O
bla!' O
You O
really O
are O
a O
queer O
fellow. O
. O
. O
." O
Moisey O
Moisevitch O
came O
in. O
He O
looked O
anxiously O
at O
Solomon O
and O
at O
his O
visitors, O
and O
again O
the O
skin O
on O
his O
face O
quivered O
nervously. O
Yegorushka O
shook O
his O
head O
and O
looked O
about O
him; O
he O
caught O
a O
passing O
glimpse O
of O
Solomon's O
face O
at O
the O
very O
moment O
when O
it O
was O
turned O
three-quarters O
towards O
him O
and O
when O
the O
shadow O
of O
his O
long O
nose O
divided O
his O
left O
cheek O
in O
half; O
the O
contemptuous O
smile O
mingled O
with O
that O
shadow; O
the O
gleaming O
sarcastic O
eyes, O
the O
haughty O
expression, O
and O
the O
whole O
plucked-looking O
little O
figure, O
dancing O
and O
doubling O
itself O
before O
Yegorushka's O
eyes, O
made O
him O
now O
not O
like O
a O
buffoon, O
but O
like O
something O
one O
sometimes O
dreams O
of, O
like O
an O
evil O
spirit. O
"What O
a O
ferocious O
fellow O
you've O
got O
here, O
Moisey O
Moisevitch! O
God O
bless O
him!" O
said O
Father O
Christopher O
with O
a O
smile. O
"You O
ought O
to O
find O
him O
a O
place O
or O
a O
wife O
or O
something. O
. O
. O
. O
There's O
no O
knowing O
what O
to O
make O
of O
him. O
. O
. O
." O
Kuzmitchov O
frowned O
angrily. O
Moisey O
Moisevitch O
looked O
uneasily O
and O
inquiringly O
at O
his O
brother O
and O
the O
visitors O
again. O
"Solomon, O
go O
away!" O
he O
said O
shortly. O
"Go O
away!" O
and O
he O
added O
something O
in O
Yiddish. O
Solomon O
gave O
an O
abrupt O
laugh O
and O
went O
out. O
"What O
was O
it?" O
Moisey O
Moisevitch O
asked O
Father O
Christopher O
anxiously. O
"He O
forgets O
himself," O
answered O
Kuzmitchov. O
"He's O
rude O
and O
thinks O
too O
much O
of O
himself." O
"I O
knew O
it!" O
Moisey O
Moisevitch O
cried O
in O
horror, O
clasping O
his O
hands. O
"Oh O
dear, O
oh O
dear!" O
he O
muttered O
in O
a O
low O
voice. O
"Be O
so O
kind O
as O
to O
excuse O
it, O
and O
don't O
be O
angry. O
He O
is O
such O
a O
queer O
fellow, O
such O
a O
queer O
fellow! O
Oh O
dear, O
oh O
dear! O
He O
is O
my O
own O
brother, O
but O
I O
have O
never O
had O
anything O
but O
trouble O
from O
him. O
You O
know O
he's. O
. O
." O
Moisey O
Moisevitch O
crooked O
his O
finger O
by O
his O
forehead O
and O
went O
on: O
"He O
is O
not O
in O
his O
right O
mind; O
. O
. O
. O
he's O
hopeless. O
And O
I O
don't O
know O
what O
I O
am O
to O
do O
with O
him! O
He O
cares O
for O
nobody, O
he O
respects O
nobody, O
and O
is O
afraid O
of O
nobody. O
. O
. O
. O
You O
know O
he O
laughs O
at O
everybody, O
he O
says O
silly O
things, O
speaks O
familiarly O
to O
anyone. O
You O
wouldn't O
believe O
it, O
Varlamov O
came O
here O
one O
day O
and O
Solomon O
said O
such O
things O
to O
him O
that O
he O
gave O
us O
both O
a O
taste O
of O
his O
whip. O
. O
. O
. O
But O
why O
whip O
me? O
Was O
it O
my O
fault? O
God O
has O
robbed O
him O
of O
his O
wits, O
so O
it O
is O
God's O
will, O
and O
how O
am O
I O
to O
blame?" O
Ten O
minutes O
passed O
and O
Moisey O
Moisevitch O
was O
still O
muttering O
in O
an O
undertone O
and O
sighing: O
"He O
does O
not O
sleep O
at O
night, O
and O
is O
always O
thinking O
and O
thinking O
and O
thinking, O
and O
what O
he O
is O
thinking O
about O
God O
only O
knows. O
If O
you O
go O
to O
him O
at O
night O
he O
is O
angry O
and O
laughs. O
He O
doesn't O
like O
me O
either O
. O
. O
. O
. O
And O
there O
is O
nothing O
he O
wants! O
When O
our O
father O
died O
he O
left O
us O
each O
six O
thousand O
roubles. O
I O
bought O
myself O
an O
inn, O
married, O
and O
now O
I O
have O
children; O
and O
he O
burnt O
all O
his O
money O
in O
the O
stove. O
Such O
a O
pity, O
such O
a O
pity! O
Why O
burn O
it? O
If O
he O
didn't O
want O
it O
he O
could O
give O
it O
to O
me, O
but O
why O
burn O
it?" O
Suddenly O
the O
swing-door O
creaked O
and O
the O
floor O
shook O
under O
footsteps. O
Yegorushka O
felt O
a O
draught O
of O
cold O
air, O
and O
it O
seemed O
to O
him O
as O
though O
some O
big O
black O
bird O
had O
passed O
by O
him O
and O
had O
fluttered O
its O
wings O
close O
in O
his O
face. O
He O
opened O
his O
eyes. O
. O
. O
. O
His O
uncle O
was O
standing O
by O
the O
sofa O
with O
his O
sack O
in O
his O
hands O
ready O
for O
departure; O
Father O
Christopher, O
holding O
his O
broad-brimmed O
top-hat, O
was O
bowing O
to O
someone O
and O
smiling-- O
not O
his O
usual O
soft O
kindly O
smile, O
but O
a O
respectful O
forced O
smile O
which O
did O
not O
suit O
his O
face O
at O
all-- O
while O
Moisey O
Moisevitch O
looked O
as O
though O
his O
body O
had O
been O
broken O
into O
three O
parts, O
and O
he O
were O
balancing O
and O
doing O
his O
utmost O
not O
to O
drop O
to O
pieces. O
Only O
Solomon O
stood O
in O
the O
corner O
with O
his O
arms O
folded, O
as O
though O
nothing O
had O
happened, O
and O
smiled O
contemptuously O
as O
before. O
"Your O
Excellency O
must O
excuse O
us O
for O
not O
being O
tidy," O
moaned O
Moisey O
Moisevitch O
with O
the O
agonizingly O
sweet O
smile, O
taking O
no O
more O
notice O
of O
Kuzmitchov O
or O
Father O
Christopher, O
but O
swaying O
his O
whole O
person O
so O
as O
to O
avoid O
dropping O
to O
pieces. O
"We O
are O
plain O
folks, O
your O
Excellency." O
Yegorushka O
rubbed O
his O
eyes. O
In O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
room O
there O
really O
was O
standing O
an O
Excellency, O
in O
the O
form O
of O
a O
young O
plump O
and O
very O
beautiful O
woman O
in O
a O
black O
dress O
and O
a O
straw O
hat. O
Before O
Yegorushka O
had O
time O
to O
examine O
her O
features O
the O
image O
of O
the O
solitary O
graceful O
poplar O
he O
had O
seen O
that O
day O
on O
the O
hill O
for O
some O
reason O
came O
into O
his O
mind. O
"Has O
Varlamov O
been O
here O
to-day?" O
a O
woman's O
voice O
inquired. O
"No, O
your O
Excellency," O
said O
Moisey O
Moisevitch. O
"If O
you O
see O
him O
to-morrow, O
ask O
him O
to O
come O
and O
see O
me O
for O
a O
minute." O
All O
at O
once, O
quite O
unexpectedly, O
Yegorushka O
saw O
half O
an O
inch O
from O
his O
eyes O
velvety O
black O
eyebrows, O
big O
brown O
eyes, O
delicate O
feminine O
cheeks O
with O
dimples, O
from O
which O
smiles O
seemed O
radiating O
all O
over O
the O
face O
like O
sunbeams. O
There O
was O
a O
glorious O
scent. O
"What O
a O
pretty O
boy!" O
said O
the O
lady. O
"Whose O
boy O
is O
it? O
Kazimir O
Mihalovitch, O
look O
what O
a O
charming O
fellow! O
Good O
heavens, O
he O
is O
asleep!" O
And O
the O
lady O
kissed O
Yegorushka O
warmly O
on O
both O
cheeks, O
and O
he O
smiled O
and, O
thinking O
he O
was O
asleep, O
shut O
his O
eyes. O
The O
swing-door O
squeaked, O
and O
there O
was O
the O
sound O
of O
hurried O
footsteps, O
coming O
in O
and O
going O
out. O
"Yegorushka, O
Yegorushka!" O
he O
heard O
two O
bass O
voices O
whisper. O
"Get O
up; O
it O
is O
time O
to O
start." O
Somebody, O
it O
seemed O
to O
be O
Deniska, O
set O
him O
on O
his O
feet O
and O
led O
him O
by O
the O
arm. O
On O
the O
way O
he O
half-opened O
his O
eyes O
and O
once O
more O
saw O
the O
beautiful O
lady O
in O
the O
black O
dress O
who O
had O
kissed O
him. O
She O
was O
standing O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
room O
and O
watched O
him O
go O
out, O
smiling O
at O
him O
and O
nodding O
her O
head O
in O
a O
friendly O
way. O
As O
he O
got O
near O
the O
door O
he O
saw O
a O
handsome, O
stoutly O
built, O
dark O
man O
in O
a O
bowler O
hat O
and O
in O
leather O
gaiters. O
This O
must O
have O
been O
the O
lady's O
escort. O
"Woa!" O
he O
heard O
from O
the O
yard. O
At O
the O
front O
door O
Yegorushka O
saw O
a O
splendid O
new O
carriage O
and O
a O
pair O
of O
black O
horses. O
On O
the O
box O
sat O
a O
groom O
in O
livery, O
with O
a O
long O
whip O
in O
his O
hands. O
No O
one O
but O
Solomon O
came O
to O
see O
the O
travellers O
off. O
His O
face O
was O
tense O
with O
a O
desire O
to O
laugh; O
he O
looked O
as O
though O
he O
were O
waiting O
impatiently O
for O
the O
visitors O
to O
be O
gone, O
so O
that O
he O
might O
laugh O
at O
them O
without O
restraint. O
"The O
Countess O
Dranitsky," O
whispered O
Father O
Christopher, O
clambering O
into O
the O
chaise. O
"Yes, O
Countess O
Dranitsky," O
repeated O
Kuzmitchov, O
also O
in O
a O
whisper. O
The O
impression O
made O
by O
the O
arrival O
of O
the O
countess O
was O
probably O
very O
great, O
for O
even O
Deniska O
spoke O
in O
a O
whisper, O
and O
only O
ventured O
to O
lash O
his O
bays O
and O
shout O
when O
the O
chaise O
had O
driven O
a O
quarter O
of O
a O
mile O
away O
and O
nothing O
could O
be O
seen O
of O
the O
inn O
but O
a O
dim O
light. O
IV O
Who O
was O
this O
elusive, O
mysterious O
Varlamov O
of O
whom O
people O
talked O
so O
much, O
whom O
Solomon O
despised, O
and O
whom O
even O
the O
beautiful O
countess O
needed? O
Sitting O
on O
the O
box O
beside O
Deniska, O
Yegorushka, O
half O
asleep, O
thought O
about O
this O
person. O
He O
had O
never O
seen O
him. O
But O
he O
had O
often O
heard O
of O
him O
and O
pictured O
him O
in O
his O
imagination. O
He O
knew O
that O
Varlamov O
possessed O
several O
tens O
of O
thousands O
of O
acres O
of O
land, O
about O
a O
hundred O
thousand O
sheep, O
and O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
money. O
Of O
his O
manner O
of O
life O
and O
occupation O
Yegorushka O
knew O
nothing, O
except O
that O
he O
was O
always O
"going O
his O
rounds O
in O
these O
parts," O
and O
he O
was O
always O
being O
looked O
for. O
At O
home O
Yegorushka O
had O
heard O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
the O
Countess O
Dranitsky, O
too. O
She, O
too, O
had O
some O
tens O
of O
thousands O
of O
acres, O
a O
great O
many O
sheep, O
a O
stud O
farm O
and O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
money, O
but O
she O
did O
not O
"go O
rounds," O
but O
lived O
at O
home O
in O
a O
splendid O
house O
and O
grounds, O
about O
which O
Ivan O
Ivanitch, O
who O
had O
been O
more O
than O
once O
at O
the O
countess's O
on O
business, O
and O
other O
acquaintances O
told O
many O
marvellous O
tales; O
thus, O
for O
instance, O
they O
said O
that O
in O
the O
countess's O
drawing-room, O
where O
the O
portraits O
of O
all O
the O
kings O
of O
Poland O
hung O
on O
the O
walls, O
there O
was O
a O
big O
table-clock O
in O
the O
form O
of O
a O
rock, O
on O
the O
rock O
a O
gold O
horse O
with O
diamond O
eyes, O
rearing, O
and O
on O
the O
horse O
the O
figure O
of O
a O
rider O
also O
of O
gold, O
who O
brandished O
his O
sword O
to O
right O
and O
to O
left O
whenever O
the O
clock O
struck. O
They O
said, O
too, O
that O
twice O
a O
year O
the O
countess O
used O
to O
give O
a O
ball, O
to O
which O
the O
gentry O
and O
officials O
of O
the O
whole O
province O
were O
invited, O
and O
to O
which O
even O
Varlamov O
used O
to O
come; O
all O
the O
visitors O
drank O
tea O
from O
silver O
samovars, O
ate O
all O
sorts O
of O
extraordinary O
things O
(they O
had O
strawberries O
and O
raspberries, O
for O
instance, O
in O
winter O
at O
Christmas), O
and O
danced O
to O
a O
band O
which O
played O
day O
and O
night. O
. O
. O
. O
"And O
how O
beautiful O
she O
is," O
thought O
Yegorushka, O
remembering O
her O
face O
and O
smile. O
Kuzmitchov, O
too, O
was O
probably O
thinking O
about O
the O
countess. O
For O
when O
the O
chaise O
had O
driven O
a O
mile O
and O
a O
half O
he O
said: O
"But O
doesn't O
that O
Kazimir O
Mihalovitch O
plunder O
her O
right O
and O
left! O
The O
year O
before O
last O
when, O
do O
you O
remember, O
I O
bought O
some O
wool O
from O
her, O
he O
made O
over O
three O
thousand O
from O
my O
purchase O
alone." O
"That O
is O
just O
what O
you O
would O
expect O
from O
a O
Pole," O
said O
Father O
Christopher. O
"And O
little O
does O
it O
trouble O
her. O
Young O
and O
foolish, O
as O
they O
say, O
her O
head O
is O
full O
of O
nonsense." O
Yegorushka, O
for O
some O
reason, O
longed O
to O
think O
of O
nothing O
but O
Varlamov O
and O
the O
countess, O
particularly O
the O
latter. O
His O
drowsy O
brain O
utterly O
refused O
ordinary O
thoughts, O
was O
in O
a O
cloud O
and O
retained O
only O
fantastic O
fairy-tale O
images, O
which O
have O
the O
advantage O
of O
springing O
into O
the O
brain O
of O
themselves O
without O
any O
effort O
on O
the O
part O
of O
the O
thinker, O
and O
completely O
vanishing O
of O
themselves O
at O
a O
mere O
shake O
of O
the O
head; O
and, O
indeed, O
nothing O
that O
was O
around O
him O
disposed O
to O
ordinary O
thoughts. O
On O
the O
right O
there O
were O
the O
dark O
hills O
which O
seemed O
to O
be O
screening O
something O
unseen O
and O
terrible; O
on O
the O
left O
the O
whole O
sky O
about O
the O
horizon O
was O
covered O
with O
a O
crimson O
glow, O
and O
it O
was O
hard O
to O
tell O
whether O
there O
was O
a O
fire O
somewhere, O
or O
whether O
it O
was O
the O
moon O
about O
to O
rise. O
As O
by O
day O
the O
distance O
could O
be O
seen, O
but O
its O
tender O
lilac O
tint O
had O
gone, O
quenched O
by O
the O
evening O
darkness, O
in O
which O
the O
whole O
steppe O
was O
hidden O
like O
Moisey O
Moisevitch's O
children O
under O
the O
quilt. O
Corncrakes O
and O
quails O
do O
not O
call O
in O
the O
July O
nights, O
the O
nightingale O
does O
not O
sing O
in O
the O
woodland O
marsh, O
and O
there O
is O
no O
scent O
of O
flowers, O
but O
still O
the O
steppe O
is O
lovely O
and O
full O
of O
life. O
As O
soon O
as O
the O
sun O
goes O
down O
and O
the O
darkness O
enfolds O
the O
earth, O
the O
day's O
weariness O
is O
forgotten, O
everything O
is O
forgiven, O
and O
the O
steppe O
breathes O
a O
light O
sigh O
from O
its O
broad O
bosom. O
As O
though O
because O
the O
grass O
cannot O
see O
in O
the O
dark O
that O
it O
has O
grown O
old, O
a O
gay O
youthful O
twitter O
rises O
up O
from O
it, O
such O
as O
is O
not O
heard O
by O
day; O
chirruping, O
twittering, O
whistling, O
scratching, O
the O
basses, O
tenors O
and O
sopranos O
of O
the O
steppe O
all O
mingle O
in O
an O
incessant, O
monotonous O
roar O
of O
sound O
in O
which O
it O
is O
sweet O
to O
brood O
on O
memories O
and O
sorrows. O
The O
monotonous O
twitter O
soothes O
to O
sleep O
like O
a O
lullaby; O
you O
drive O
and O
feel O
you O
are O
falling O
asleep, O
but O
suddenly O
there O
comes O
the O
abrupt O
agitated O
cry O
of O
a O
wakeful O
bird, O
or O
a O
vague O
sound O
like O
a O
voice O
crying O
out O
in O
wonder O
"A-ah, O
a-ah!" O
and O
slumber O
closes O
one's O
eyelids O
again. O
Or O
you O
drive O
by O
a O
little O
creek O
where O
there O
are O
bushes O
and O
hear O
the O
bird, O
called O
by O
the O
steppe O
dwellers O
"the O
sleeper," O
call O
"Asleep, O
asleep, O
asleep!" O
while O
another O
laughs O
or O
breaks O
into O
trills O
of O
hysterical O
weeping-- O
that O
is O
the O
owl. O
For O
whom O
do O
they O
call O
and O
who O
hears O
them O
on O
that O
plain, O
God O
only O
knows, O
but O
there O
is O
deep O
sadness O
and O
lamentation O
in O
their O
cry. O
. O
. O
. O
There O
is O
a O
scent O
of O
hay O
and O
dry O
grass O
and O
belated O
flowers, O
but O
the O
scent O
is O
heavy, O
sweetly O
mawkish O
and O
soft. O
Everything O
can O
be O
seen O
through O
the O
mist, O
but O
it O
is O
hard O
to O
make O
out O
the O
colours O
and O
the O
outlines O
of O
objects. O
Everything O
looks O
different O
from O
what O
it O
is. O
You O
drive O
on O
and O
suddenly O
see O
standing O
before O
you O
right O
in O
the O
roadway O
a O
dark O
figure O
like O
a O
monk; O
it O
stands O
motionless, O
waiting, O
holding O
something O
in O
its O
hands. O
. O
. O
. O
Can O
it O
be O
a O
robber? O
The O
figure O
comes O
closer, O
grows O
bigger; O
now O
it O
is O
on O
a O
level O
with O
the O
chaise, O
and O
you O
see O
it O
is O
not O
a O
man, O
but O
a O
solitary O
bush O
or O
a O
great O
stone. O
Such O
motionless O
expectant O
figures O
stand O
on O
the O
low O
hills, O
hide O
behind O
the O
old O
barrows, O
peep O
out O
from O
the O
high O
grass, O
and O
they O
all O
look O
like O
human O
beings O
and O
arouse O
suspicion. O
And O
when O
the O
moon O
rises O
the O
night O
becomes O
pale O
and O
dim. O
The O
mist O
seems O
to O
have O
passed O
away. O
The O
air O
is O
transparent, O
fresh O
and O
warm; O
one O
can O
see O
well O
in O
all O
directions O
and O
even O
distinguish O
the O
separate O
stalks O
of O
grass O
by O
the O
wayside. O
Stones O
and O
bits O
of O
pots O
can O
be O
seen O
at O
a O
long O
distance. O
The O
suspicious O
figures O
like O
monks O
look O
blacker O
against O
the O
light O
background O
of O
the O
night, O
and O
seem O
more O
sinister. O
More O
and O
more O
often O
in O
the O
midst O
of O
the O
monotonous O
chirruping O
there O
comes O
the O
sound O
of O
the O
"A-ah, O
a-ah!" O
of O
astonishment O
troubling O
the O
motionless O
air, O
and O
the O
cry O
of O
a O
sleepless O
or O
delirious O
bird. O
Broad O
shadows O
move O
across O
the O
plain O
like O
clouds O
across O
the O
sky, O
and O
in O
the O
inconceivable O
distance, O
if O
you O
look O
long O
and O
intently O
at O
it, O
misty O
monstrous O
shapes O
rise O
up O
and O
huddle O
one O
against O
another. O
. O
. O
. O
It O
is O
rather O
uncanny. O
One O
glances O
at O
the O
pale O
green, O
star-spangled O
sky O
on O
which O
there O
is O
no O
cloudlet, O
no O
spot, O
and O
understands O
why O
the O
warm O
air O
is O
motionless, O
why O
nature O
is O
on O
her O
guard, O
afraid O
to O
stir: O
she O
is O
afraid O
and O
reluctant O
to O
lose O
one O
instant O
of O
life. O
Of O
the O
unfathomable O
depth O
and O
infinity O
of O
the O
sky O
one O
can O
only O
form O
a O
conception O
at O
sea O
and O
on O
the O
steppe O
by O
night O
when O
the O
moon O
is O
shining. O
It O
is O
terribly O
lonely O
and O
caressing; O
it O
looks O
down O
languid O
and O
alluring, O
and O
its O
caressing O
sweetness O
makes O
one O
giddy. O
You O
drive O
on O
for O
one O
hour, O
for O
a O
second. O
. O
. O
. O
You O
meet O
upon O
the O
way O
a O
silent O
old O
barrow O
or O
a O
stone O
figure O
put O
up O
God O
knows O
when O
and O
by O
whom; O
a O
nightbird O
floats O
noiselessly O
over O
the O
earth, O
and O
little O
by O
little O
those O
legends O
of O
the O
steppes, O
the O
tales O
of O
men O
you O
have O
met, O
the O
stories O
of O
some O
old O
nurse O
from O
the O
steppe, O
and O
all O
the O
things O
you O
have O
managed O
to O
see O
and O
treasure O
in O
your O
soul, O
come O
back O
to O
your O
mind. O
And O
then O
in O
the O
churring O
of O
insects, O
in O
the O
sinister O
figures, O
in O
the O
ancient O
barrows, O
in O
the O
blue O
sky, O
in O
the O
moonlight, O
in O
the O
flight O
of O
the O
nightbird, O
in O
everything O
you O
see O
and O
hear, O
triumphant O
beauty, O
youth, O
the O
fulness O
of O
power, O
and O
the O
passionate O
thirst O
for O
life O
begin O
to O
be O
apparent; O
the O
soul O
responds O
to O
the O
call O
of O
her O
lovely O
austere O
fatherland, O
and O
longs O
to O
fly O
over O
the O
steppes O
with O
the O
nightbird. O
And O
in O
the O
triumph O
of O
beauty, O
in O
the O
exuberance O
of O
happiness O
you O
are O
conscious O
of O
yearning O
and O
grief, O
as O
though O
the O
steppe O
knew O
she O
was O
solitary, O
knew O
that O
her O
wealth O
and O
her O
inspiration O
were O
wasted O
for O
the O
world, O
not O
glorified O
in O
song, O
not O
wanted O
by O
anyone; O
and O
through O
the O
joyful O
clamour O
one O
hears O
her O
mournful, O
hopeless O
call O
for O
singers, O
singers! O
"Woa! O
Good-evening, O
Panteley! O
Is O
everything O
all O
right?" O
"First-rate, O
Ivan O
Ivanitch! O
 O
Haven't O
you O
seen O
Varlamov, O
lads?" O
"No, O
we O
haven't." O
Yegorushka O
woke O
up O
and O
opened O
his O
eyes. O
The O
chaise O
had O
stopped. O
On O
the O
right O
the O
train O
of O
waggons O
stretched O
for O
a O
long O
way O
ahead O
on O
the O
road, O
and O
men O
were O
moving O
to O
and O
fro O
near O
them. O
All O
the O
waggons O
being O
loaded O
up O
with O
great O
bales O
of O
wool O
looked O
very O
high O
and O
fat, O
while O
the O
horses O
looked O
short-legged O
and O
little. O
"Well, O
then, O
we O
shall O
go O
on O
to O
the O
Molokans'!" O
Kuzmitchov O
said O
aloud. O
"The O
Jew O
told O
us O
that O
Varlamov O
was O
putting O
up O
for O
the O
night O
at O
the O
Molokans'. O
So O
good-bye, O
lads! O
Good O
luck O
to O
you!" O
"Good-bye, O
Ivan O
Ivanitch," O
several O
voices O
replied. O
"I O
say, O
lads," O
Kuzmitchov O
cried O
briskly, O
"you O
take O
my O
little O
lad O
along O
with O
you! O
Why O
should O
he O
go O
jolting O
off O
with O
us O
for O
nothing? O
You O
put O
him O
on O
the O
bales, O
Panteley, O
and O
let O
him O
come O
on O
slowly, O
and O
we O
shall O
overtake O
you. O
Get O
down, O
Yegor! O
Go O
on; O
it's O
all O
right. O
. O
. O
." O
Yegorushka O
got O
down O
from O
the O
box-seat. O
Several O
hands O
caught O
him, O
lifted O
him O
high O
into O
the O
air, O
and O
he O
found O
himself O
on O
something O
big, O
soft, O
and O
rather O
wet O
with O
dew. O
It O
seemed O
to O
him O
now O
as O
though O
the O
sky O
were O
quite O
close O
and O
the O
earth O
far O
away. O
"Hey, O
take O
his O
little O
coat!" O
Deniska O
shouted O
from O
somewhere O
far O
below. O
His O
coat O
and O
bundle O
flung O
up O
from O
far O
below O
fell O
close O
to O
Yegorushka. O
Anxious O
not O
to O
think O
of O
anything, O
he O
quickly O
put O
his O
bundle O
under O
his O
head O
and O
covered O
himself O
with O
his O
coat, O
and O
stretching O
his O
legs O
out O
and O
shrinking O
a O
little O
from O
the O
dew, O
he O
laughed O
with O
content. O
"Sleep, O
sleep, O
sleep, O
. O
. O
." O
he O
thought. O
"Don't O
be O
unkind O
to O
him, O
you O
devils!" O
he O
heard O
Deniska's O
voice O
below. O
"Good-bye, O
lads; O
good O
luck O
to O
you," O
shouted O
Kuzmitchov. O
"I O
rely O
upon O
you!" O
"Don't O
you O
be O
uneasy, O
Ivan O
Ivanitch!" O
Deniska O
shouted O
to O
the O
horses, O
the O
chaise O
creaked O
and O
started, O
not O
along O
the O
road, O
but O
somewhere O
off O
to O
the O
side. O
For O
two O
minutes O
there O
was O
silence, O
as O
though O
the O
waggons O
were O
asleep O
and O
there O
was O
no O
sound O
except O
the O
clanking O
of O
the O
pails O
tied O
on O
at O
the O
back O
of O
the O
chaise O
as O
it O
slowly O
died O
away O
in O
the O
distance. O
Then O
someone O
at O
the O
head O
of O
the O
waggons O
shouted: O
"Kiruha! O
Sta-art!" O
The O
foremost O
of O
the O
waggons O
creaked, O
then O
the O
second, O
then O
the O
third. O
. O
. O
. O
Yegorushka O
felt O
the O
waggon O
he O
was O
on O
sway O
and O
creak O
also. O
The O
waggons O
were O
moving. O
Yegorushka O
took O
a O
tighter O
hold O
of O
the O
cord O
with O
which O
the O
bales O
were O
tied O
on, O
laughed O
again O
with O
content, O
shifted O
the O
cake O
in O
his O
pocket, O
and O
fell O
asleep O
just O
as O
he O
did O
in O
his O
bed O
at O
home. O
. O
. O
. O
When O
he O
woke O
up O
the O
sun O
had O
risen, O
it O
was O
screened O
by O
an O
ancient O
barrow, O
and, O
trying O
to O
shed O
its O
light O
upon O
the O
earth, O
it O
scattered O
its O
beams O
in O
all O
directions O
and O
flooded O
the O
horizon O
with O
gold. O
It O
seemed O
to O
Yegorushka O
that O
it O
was O
not O
in O
its O
proper O
place, O
as O
the O
day O
before O
it O
had O
risen O
behind O
his O
back, O
and O
now O
it O
was O
much O
more O
to O
his O
left. O
. O
. O
. O
And O
the O
whole O
landscape O
was O
different. O
There O
were O
no O
hills O
now, O
but O
on O
all O
sides, O
wherever O
one O
looked, O
there O
stretched O
the O
brown O
cheerless O
plain; O
here O
and O
there O
upon O
it O
small O
barrows O
rose O
up O
and O
rooks O
flew O
as O
they O
had O
done O
the O
day O
before. O
The O
belfries O
and O
huts O
of O
some O
village O
showed O
white O
in O
the O
distance O
ahead; O
as O
it O
was O
Sunday O
the O
Little O
Russians O
were O
at O
home O
baking O
and O
cooking-- O
that O
could O
be O
seen O
by O
the O
smoke O
which O
rose O
from O
every O
chimney O
and O
hung, O
a O
dark O
blue O
transparent O
veil, O
over O
the O
village. O
In O
between O
the O
huts O
and O
beyond O
the O
church O
there O
were O
blue O
glimpses O
of O
a O
river, O
and O
beyond O
the O
river O
a O
misty O
distance. O
But O
nothing O
was O
so O
different O
from O
yesterday O
as O
the O
road. O
Something O
extraordinarily O
broad, O
spread O
out O
and O
titanic, O
stretched O
over O
the O
steppe O
by O
way O
of O
a O
road. O
It O
was O
a O
grey O
streak O
well O
trodden O
down O
and O
covered O
with O
dust, O
like O
all O
roads. O
Its O
width O
puzzled O
Yegorushka O
and O
brought O
thoughts O
of O
fairy O
tales O
to O
his O
mind. O
Who O
travelled O
along O
that O
road? O
Who O
needed O
so O
much O
space? O
It O
was O
strange O
and O
unintelligible. O
It O
might O
have O
been O
supposed O
that O
giants O
with O
immense O
strides, O
such O
as O
Ilya O
Muromets O
and O
Solovy O
the O
Brigand, O
were O
still O
surviving O
in O
Russia, O
and O
that O
their O
gigantic O
steeds O
were O
still O
alive. O
Yegorushka, O
looking O
at O
the O
road, O
imagined O
some O
half O
a O
dozen O
high O
chariots O
racing O
along O
side O
by O
side, O
like O
some O
he O
used O
to O
see O
in O
pictures O
in O
his O
Scripture O
history; O
these O
chariots O
were O
each O
drawn O
by O
six O
wild O
furious O
horses, O
and O
their O
great O
wheels O
raised O
a O
cloud O
of O
dust O
to O
the O
sky, O
while O
the O
horses O
were O
driven O
by O
men O
such O
as O
one O
may O
see O
in O
one's O
dreams O
or O
in O
imagination O
brooding O
over O
fairy O
tales. O
And O
if O
those O
figures O
had O
existed, O
how O
perfectly O
in O
keeping O
with O
the O
steppe O
and O
the O
road O
they O
would O
have O
been! O
Telegraph-poles O
with O
two O
wires O
on O
them O
stretched O
along O
the O
right O
side O
of O
the O
road O
to O
its O
furthermost O
limit. O
Growing O
smaller O
and O
smaller O
they O
disappeared O
near O
the O
village O
behind O
the O
huts O
and O
green O
trees, O
and O
then O
again O
came O
into O
sight O
in O
the O
lilac O
distance O
in O
the O
form O
of O
very O
small O
thin O
sticks O
that O
looked O
like O
pencils O
stuck O
into O
the O
ground. O
Hawks, O
falcons, O
and O
crows O
sat O
on O
the O
wires O
and O
looked O
indifferently O
at O
the O
moving O
waggons. O
Yegorushka O
was O
lying O
in O
the O
last O
of O
the O
waggons, O
and O
so O
could O
see O
the O
whole O
string. O
There O
were O
about O
twenty O
waggons, O
and O
there O
was O
a O
driver O
to O
every O
three O
waggons. O
By O
the O
last O
waggon, O
the O
one O
in O
which O
Yegorushka O
was, O
there O
walked O
an O
old O
man O
with O
a O
grey O
beard, O
as O
short O
and O
lean O
as O
Father O
Christopher, O
but O
with O
a O
sunburnt, O
stern O
and O
brooding O
face. O
It O
is O
very O
possible O
that O
the O
old O
man O
was O
not O
stern O
and O
not O
brooding, O
but O
his O
red O
eyelids O
and O
his O
sharp O
long O
nose O
gave O
his O
face O
a O
stern O
frigid O
expression O
such O
as O
is O
common O
with O
people O
in O
the O
habit O
of O
continually O
thinking O
of O
serious O
things O
in O
solitude. O
Like O
Father O
Christopher O
he O
was O
wearing O
a O
wide-brimmed O
top-hat, O
not O
like O
a O
gentleman's, O
but O
made O
of O
brown O
felt, O
and O
in O
shape O
more O
like O
a O
cone O
with O
the O
top O
cut O
off O
than O
a O
real O
top-hat. O
Probably O
from O
a O
habit O
acquired O
in O
cold O
winters, O
when O
he O
must O
more O
than O
once O
have O
been O
nearly O
frozen O
as O
he O
trudged O
beside O
the O
waggons, O
he O
kept O
slapping O
his O
thighs O
and O
stamping O
with O
his O
feet O
as O
he O
walked. O
Noticing O
that O
Yegorushka O
was O
awake, O
he O
looked O
at O
him O
and O
said, O
shrugging O
his O
shoulders O
as O
though O
from O
the O
cold: O
"Ah, O
you O
are O
awake, O
youngster! O
So O
you O
are O
the O
son O
of O
Ivan O
Ivanitch?" O
"No; O
his O
nephew. O
. O
. O
." O
"Nephew O
of O
Ivan O
Ivanitch? O
Here O
I O
have O
taken O
off O
my O
boots O
and O
am O
hopping O
along O
barefoot. O
My O
feet O
are O
bad; O
they O
are O
swollen, O
and O
it's O
easier O
without O
my O
boots O
. O
. O
. O
easier, O
youngster O
. O
. O
. O
without O
boots, O
I O
mean. O
. O
. O
. O
So O
you O
are O
his O
nephew? O
He O
is O
a O
good O
man; O
no O
harm O
in O
him. O
. O
. O
. O
God O
give O
him O
health. O
. O
. O
. O
No O
harm O
in O
him O
. O
. O
. O
I O
mean O
Ivan O
Ivanitch. O
. O
. O
. O
He O
has O
gone O
to O
the O
Molokans'. O
. O
. O
. O
O O
Lord, O
have O
mercy O
upon O
us!" O
The O
old O
man O
talked, O
too, O
as O
though O
it O
were O
very O
cold, O
pausing O
and O
not O
opening O
his O
mouth O
properly; O
and O
he O
mispronounced O
the O
labial O
consonants, O
stuttering O
over O
them O
as O
though O
his O
lips O
were O
frozen. O
As O
he O
talked O
to O
Yegorushka O
he O
did O
not O
once O
smile, O
and O
he O
seemed O
stern. O
Two O
waggons O
ahead O
of O
them O
there O
walked O
a O
man O
wearing O
a O
long O
reddish-brown O
coat, O
a O
cap O
and O
high O
boots O
with O
sagging O
bootlegs O
and O
carrying O
a O
whip O
in O
his O
hand. O
This O
was O
not O
an O
old O
man, O
only O
about O
forty. O
When O
he O
looked O
round O
Yegorushka O
saw O
a O
long O
red O
face O
with O
a O
scanty O
goat-beard O
and O
a O
spongy O
looking O
swelling O
under O
his O
right O
eye. O
Apart O
from O
this O
very O
ugly O
swelling, O
there O
was O
another O
peculiar O
thing O
about O
him O
which O
caught O
the O
eye O
at O
once: O
in O
his O
left O
hand O
he O
carried O
a O
whip, O
while O
he O
waved O
the O
right O
as O
though O
he O
were O
conducting O
an O
unseen O
choir; O
from O
time O
to O
time O
he O
put O
the O
whip O
under O
his O
arm, O
and O
then O
he O
conducted O
with O
both O
hands O
and O
hummed O
something O
to O
himself. O
The O
next O
driver O
was O
a O
long O
rectilinear O
figure O
with O
extremely O
sloping O
shoulders O
and O
a O
back O
as O
flat O
as O
a O
board. O
He O
held O
himself O
as O
stiffly O
erect O
as O
though O
he O
were O
marching O
or O
had O
swallowed O
a O
yard O
measure. O
His O
hands O
did O
not O
swing O
as O
he O
walked, O
but O
hung O
down O
as O
if O
they O
were O
straight O
sticks, O
and O
he O
strode O
along O
in O
a O
wooden O
way, O
after O
the O
manner O
of O
toy O
soldiers, O
almost O
without O
bending O
his O
knees, O
and O
trying O
to O
take O
as O
long O
steps O
as O
possible. O
While O
the O
old O
man O
or O
the O
owner O
of O
the O
spongy O
swelling O
were O
taking O
two O
steps O
he O
succeeded O
in O
taking O
only O
one, O
and O
so O
it O
seemed O
as O
though O
he O
were O
walking O
more O
slowly O
than O
any O
of O
them, O
and O
would O
drop O
behind. O
His O
face O
was O
tied O
up O
in O
a O
rag, O
and O
on O
his O
head O
something O
stuck O
up O
that O
looked O
like O
a O
monk's O
peaked O
cap; O
he O
was O
dressed O
in O
a O
short O
Little O
Russian O
coat, O
with O
full O
dark O
blue O
trousers O
and O
bark O
shoes. O
Yegorushka O
did O
not O
even O
distinguish O
those O
that O
were O
farther O
on. O
He O
lay O
on O
his O
stomach, O
picked O
a O
little O
hole O
in O
the O
bale, O
and, O
having O
nothing O
better O
to O
do, O
began O
twisting O
the O
wool O
into O
a O
thread. O
The O
old O
man O
trudging O
along O
below O
him O
turned O
out O
not O
to O
be O
so O
stern O
as O
one O
might O
have O
supposed O
from O
his O
face. O
Having O
begun O
a O
conversation, O
he O
did O
not O
let O
it O
drop. O
"Where O
are O
you O
going?" O
he O
asked, O
stamping O
with O
his O
feet. O
"To O
school," O
answered O
Yegorushka. O
"To O
school? O
Aha! O
. O
. O
. O
Well, O
may O
the O
Queen O
of O
Heaven O
help O
you. O
Yes. O
One O
brain O
is O
good, O
but O
two O
are O
better. O
To O
one O
man O
God O
gives O
one O
brain, O
to O
another O
two O
brains, O
and O
to O
another O
three. O
. O
. O
. O
To O
another O
three, O
that O
is O
true. O
. O
. O
. O
One O
brain O
you O
are O
born O
with, O
one O
you O
get O
from O
learning, O
and O
a O
third O
with O
a O
good O
life. O
So O
you O
see, O
my O
lad, O
it O
is O
a O
good O
thing O
if O
a O
man O
has O
three O
brains. O
Living O
is O
easier O
for O
him, O
and, O
what's O
more, O
dying O
is, O
too. O
Dying O
is, O
too. O
. O
. O
. O
And O
we O
shall O
all O
die O
for O
sure." O
The O
old O
man O
scratched O
his O
forehead, O
glanced O
upwards O
at O
Yegorushka O
with O
his O
red O
eyes, O
and O
went O
on: O
"Maxim O
Nikolaitch, O
the O
gentleman O
from O
Slavyanoserbsk, O
brought O
a O
little O
lad O
to O
school, O
too, O
last O
year. O
I O
don't O
know O
how O
he O
is O
getting O
on O
there O
in O
studying O
the O
sciences, O
but O
he O
was O
a O
nice O
good O
little O
lad. O
. O
. O
. O
God O
give O
them O
help, O
they O
are O
nice O
gentlemen. O
Yes, O
he, O
too, O
brought O
his O
boy O
to O
school. O
. O
. O
. O
In O
Slavyanoserbsk O
there O
is O
no O
establishment, O
I O
suppose, O
for O
study. O
No. O
. O
. O
. O
But O
it O
is O
a O
nice O
town. O
. O
. O
. O
There's O
an O
ordinary O
school O
for O
simple O
folks, O
but O
for O
the O
higher O
studies O
there O
is O
nothing. O
No, O
that's O
true. O
What's O
your O
name? O
. O
. O
." O
"Yegorushka." O
"Yegory, O
then. O
. O
. O
. O
The O
holy O
martyr O
Yegory, O
the O
Bearer O
of O
Victory, O
whose O
day O
is O
the O
twenty-third O
of O
April. O
And O
my O
christian O
name O
is O
Panteley, O
. O
. O
. O
Panteley O
Zaharov O
Holodov. O
. O
. O
. O
We O
are O
Holodovs O
. O
. O
. O
. O
I O
am O
a O
native O
of-- O
maybe O
you've O
heard O
of O
it-- O
Tim O
in O
the O
province O
of O
Kursk. O
My O
brothers O
are O
artisans O
and O
work O
at O
trades O
in O
the O
town, O
but O
I O
am O
a O
peasant. O
. O
. O
. O
I O
have O
remained O
a O
peasant. O
Seven O
years O
ago O
I O
went O
there-- O
home, O
I O
mean. O
I O
went O
to O
the O
village O
and O
to O
the O
town. O
. O
. O
. O
To O
Tim, O
I O
mean. O
Then, O
thank O
God, O
they O
were O
all O
alive O
and O
well; O
. O
. O
. O
but O
now O
I O
don't O
know. O
. O
. O
. O
Maybe O
some O
of O
them O
are O
dead. O
. O
. O
. O
And O
it's O
time O
they O
did O
die, O
for O
some O
of O
them O
are O
older O
than O
I O
am. O
Death O
is O
all O
right; O
it O
is O
good O
so O
long, O
of O
course, O
as O
one O
does O
not O
die O
without O
repentance. O
There O
is O
no O
worse O
evil O
than O
an O
impenitent O
death; O
an O
impenitent O
death O
is O
a O
joy O
to O
the O
devil. O
And O
if O
you O
want O
to O
die O
penitent, O
so O
that O
you O
may O
not O
be O
forbidden O
to O
enter O
the O
mansions O
of O
the O
Lord, O
pray O
to O
the O
holy O
martyr O
Varvara. O
She O
is O
the O
intercessor. O
She O
is, O
that's O
the O
truth. O
. O
. O
. O
For O
God O
has O
given O
her O
such O
a O
place O
in O
the O
heavens O
that O
everyone O
has O
the O
right O
to O
pray O
to O
her O
for O
penitence." O
Panteley O
went O
on O
muttering, O
and O
apparently O
did O
not O
trouble O
whether O
Yegorushka O
heard O
him O
or O
not. O
He O
talked O
listlessly, O
mumbling O
to O
himself, O
without O
raising O
or O
dropping O
his O
voice, O
but O
succeeded O
in O
telling O
him O
a O
great O
deal O
in O
a O
short O
time. O
All O
he O
said O
was O
made O
up O
of O
fragments O
that O
had O
very O
little O
connection O
with O
one O
another, O
and O
quite O
uninteresting O
for O
Yegorushka. O
Possibly O
he O
talked O
only O
in O
order O
to O
reckon O
over O
his O
thoughts O
aloud O
after O
the O
night O
spent O
in O
silence, O
in O
order O
to O
see O
if O
they O
were O
all O
there. O
After O
talking O
of O
repentance, O
he O
spoke O
about O
a O
certain O
Maxim O
Nikolaitch O
from O
Slavyanoserbsk. O
"Yes, O
he O
took O
his O
little O
lad; O
. O
. O
. O
he O
took O
him, O
that's O
true O
. O
. O
." O
One O
of O
the O
waggoners O
walking O
in O
front O
darted O
from O
his O
place, O
ran O
to O
one O
side O
and O
began O
lashing O
on O
the O
ground O
with O
his O
whip. O
He O
was O
a O
stalwart, O
broad-shouldered O
man O
of O
thirty, O
with O
curly O
flaxen O
hair O
and O
a O
look O
of O
great O
health O
and O
vigour. O
Judging O
from O
the O
movements O
of O
his O
shoulders O
and O
the O
whip, O
and O
the O
eagerness O
expressed O
in O
his O
attitude, O
he O
was O
beating O
something O
alive. O
Another O
waggoner, O
a O
short O
stubby O
little O
man O
with O
a O
bushy O
black O
beard, O
wearing O
a O
waistcoat O
and O
a O
shirt O
outside O
his O
trousers, O
ran O
up O
to O
him. O
The O
latter O
broke O
into O
a O
deep O
guffaw O
of O
laughter O
and O
coughing O
and O
said: O
"I O
say, O
lads, O
Dymov O
has O
killed O
a O
snake!" O
There O
are O
people O
whose O
intelligence O
can O
be O
gauged O
at O
once O
by O
their O
voice O
and O
laughter. O
The O
man O
with O
the O
black O
beard O
belonged O
to O
that O
class O
of O
fortunate O
individuals; O
impenetrable O
stupidity O
could O
be O
felt O
in O
his O
voice O
and O
laugh. O
The O
flaxen-headed O
Dymov O
had O
finished, O
and O
lifting O
from O
the O
ground O
with O
his O
whip O
something O
like O
a O
cord, O
flung O
it O
with O
a O
laugh O
into O
the O
cart. O
"That's O
not O
a O
viper; O
it's O
a O
grass O
snake!" O
shouted O
someone. O
The O
man O
with O
the O
wooden O
gait O
and O
the O
bandage O
round O
his O
face O
strode O
up O
quickly O
to O
the O
dead O
snake, O
glanced O
at O
it O
and O
flung O
up O
his O
stick-like O
arms. O
"You O
jail-bird!" O
he O
cried O
in O
a O
hollow O
wailing O
voice. O
"What O
have O
you O
killed O
a O
grass O
snake O
for? O
What O
had O
he O
done O
to O
you, O
you O
damned O
brute? O
Look, O
he O
has O
killed O
a O
grass O
snake; O
how O
would O
you O
like O
to O
be O
treated O
so?" O
"Grass O
snakes O
ought O
not O
to O
be O
killed, O
that's O
true," O
Panteley O
muttered O
placidly, O
"they O
ought O
not. O
. O
. O
They O
are O
not O
vipers; O
though O
it O
looks O
like O
a O
snake, O
it O
is O
a O
gentle, O
innocent O
creature. O
. O
. O
. O
It's O
friendly O
to O
man, O
the O
grass O
snake O
is." O
Dymov O
and O
the O
man O
with O
the O
black O
beard O
were O
probably O
ashamed, O
for O
they O
laughed O
loudly, O
and O
not O
answering, O
slouched O
lazily O
back O
to O
their O
waggons. O
When O
the O
hindmost O
waggon O
was O
level O
with O
the O
spot O
where O
the O
dead O
snake O
lay, O
the O
man O
with O
his O
face O
tied O
up O
standing O
over O
it O
turned O
to O
Panteley O
and O
asked O
in O
a O
tearful O
voice: O
"Grandfather, O
what O
did O
he O
want O
to O
kill O
the O
grass O
snake O
for?" O
His O
eyes, O
as O
Yegorushka O
saw O
now, O
were O
small O
and O
dingy O
looking; O
his O
face O
was O
grey, O
sickly O
and O
looked O
somehow O
dingy O
too O
while O
his O
chin O
was O
red O
and O
seemed O
very O
much O
swollen. O
"Grandfather, O
what O
did O
he O
kill O
it O
for?" O
he O
repeated, O
striding O
along O
beside O
Panteley. O
"A O
stupid O
fellow. O
His O
hands O
itch O
to O
kill, O
and O
that O
is O
why O
he O
does O
it," O
answered O
the O
old O
man; O
"but O
he O
oughtn't O
to O
kill O
a O
grass O
snake, O
that's O
true. O
. O
. O
. O
Dymov O
is O
a O
ruffian, O
we O
all O
know, O
he O
kills O
everything O
he O
comes O
across, O
and O
Kiruha O
did O
not O
interfere. O
He O
ought O
to O
have O
taken O
its O
part, O
but O
instead O
of O
that, O
he O
goes O
off O
into O
'Ha-ha-ha!' O
and O
'Ho-ho-ho!' O
. O
. O
. O
But O
don't O
be O
angry, O
Vassya. O
. O
. O
. O
Why O
be O
angry? O
They've O
killed O
it-- O
well, O
never O
mind O
them. O
Dymov O
is O
a O
ruffian O
and O
Kiruha O
acted O
from O
foolishness-- O
never O
mind. O
. O
. O
. O
They O
are O
foolish O
people O
without O
understanding-- O
but O
there, O
don't O
mind O
them. O
Emelyan O
here O
never O
touches O
what O
he O
shouldn't; O
he O
never O
does; O
. O
. O
. O
that O
is O
true, O
. O
. O
. O
because O
he O
is O
a O
man O
of O
education, O
while O
they O
are O
stupid. O
. O
. O
. O
Emelyan, O
he O
doesn't O
touch O
things." O
The O
waggoner O
in O
the O
reddish-brown O
coat O
and O
the O
spongy O
swelling O
on O
his O
face, O
who O
was O
conducting O
an O
unseen O
choir, O
stopped. O
Hearing O
his O
name, O
and O
waiting O
till O
Panteley O
and O
Vassya O
came O
up O
to O
him, O
he O
walked O
beside O
them. O
"What O
are O
you O
talking O
about?" O
he O
asked O
in O
a O
husky O
muffled O
voice. O
"Why, O
Vassya O
here O
is O
angry," O
said O
Panteley. O
"So O
I O
have O
been O
saying O
things O
to O
him O
to O
stop O
his O
being O
angry. O
. O
. O
. O
Oh, O
how O
my O
swollen O
feet O
hurt! O
Oh, O
oh! O
They O
are O
more O
inflamed O
than O
ever O
for O
Sunday, O
God's O
holy O
day!" O
"It's O
from O
walking," O
observed O
Vassya. O
"No, O
lad, O
no. O
It's O
not O
from O
walking. O
When O
I O
walk O
it O
seems O
easier; O
when O
I O
lie O
down O
and O
get O
warm, O
. O
. O
. O
it's O
deadly. O
Walking O
is O
easier O
for O
me." O
Emelyan, O
in O
his O
reddish-brown O
coat, O
walked O
between O
Panteley O
and O
Vassya O
and O
waved O
his O
arms, O
as O
though O
they O
were O
going O
to O
sing. O
After O
waving O
them O
a O
little O
while O
he O
dropped O
them, O
and O
croaked O
out O
hopelessly: O
"I O
have O
no O
voice. O
It's O
a O
real O
misfortune. O
All O
last O
night O
and O
this O
morning O
I O
have O
been O
haunted O
by O
the O
trio O
'Lord, O
have O
Mercy' O
that O
we O
sang O
at O
the O
wedding O
at O
Marionovsky's. O
It's O
in O
my O
head O
and O
in O
my O
throat. O
It O
seems O
as O
though O
I O
could O
sing O
it, O
but O
I O
can't; O
I O
have O
no O
voice." O
He O
paused O
for O
a O
minute, O
thinking, O
then O
went O
on: O
"For O
fifteen O
years O
I O
was O
in O
the O
choir. O
In O
all O
the O
Lugansky O
works O
there O
was, O
maybe, O
no O
one O
with O
a O
voice O
like O
mine. O
But, O
confound O
it, O
I O
bathed O
two O
years O
ago O
in O
the O
Donets, O
and O
I O
can't O
get O
a O
single O
note O
true O
ever O
since. O
I O
took O
cold O
in O
my O
throat. O
And O
without O
a O
voice O
I O
am O
like O
a O
workman O
without O
hands." O
"That's O
true," O
Panteley O
agreed. O
"I O
think O
of O
myself O
as O
a O
ruined O
man O
and O
nothing O
more." O
At O
that O
moment O
Vassya O
chanced O
to O
catch O
sight O
of O
Yegorushka. O
His O
eyes O
grew O
moist O
and O
smaller O
than O
ever. O
"There's O
a O
little O
gentleman O
driving O
with O
us," O
and O
he O
covered O
his O
nose O
with O
his O
sleeve O
as O
though O
he O
were O
bashful. O
"What O
a O
grand O
driver! O
Stay O
with O
us O
and O
you O
shall O
drive O
the O
waggons O
and O
sell O
wool." O
The O
incongruity O
of O
one O
person O
being O
at O
once O
a O
little O
gentleman O
and O
a O
waggon O
driver O
seemed O
to O
strike O
him O
as O
very O
queer O
and O
funny, O
for O
he O
burst O
into O
a O
loud O
guffaw, O
and O
went O
on O
enlarging O
upon O
the O
idea. O
Emelyan O
glanced O
upwards O
at O
Yegorushka, O
too, O
but O
coldly O
and O
cursorily. O
He O
was O
absorbed O
in O
his O
own O
thoughts, O
and O
had O
it O
not O
been O
for O
Vassya, O
would O
not O
have O
noticed O
Yegorushka's O
presence. O
Before O
five O
minutes O
had O
passed O
he O
was O
waving O
his O
arms O
again, O
then O
describing O
to O
his O
companions O
the O
beauties O
of O
the O
wedding O
anthem, O
"Lord, O
have O
Mercy," O
which O
he O
had O
remembered O
in O
the O
night. O
He O
put O
the O
whip O
under O
his O
arm O
and O
waved O
both O
hands. O
A O
mile O
from O
the O
village O
the O
waggons O
stopped O
by O
a O
well O
with O
a O
crane. O
Letting O
his O
pail O
down O
into O
the O
well, O
black-bearded O
Kiruha O
lay O
on O
his O
stomach O
on O
the O
framework O
and O
thrust O
his O
shaggy O
head, O
his O
shoulders, O
and O
part O
of O
his O
chest O
into O
the O
black O
hole, O
so O
that O
Yegorushka O
could O
see O
nothing O
but O
his O
short O
legs, O
which O
scarcely O
touched O
the O
ground. O
Seeing O
the O
reflection O
of O
his O
head O
far O
down O
at O
the O
bottom O
of O
the O
well, O
he O
was O
delighted O
and O
went O
off O
into O
his O
deep O
bass O
stupid O
laugh, O
and O
the O
echo O
from O
the O
well O
answered O
him. O
When O
he O
got O
up O
his O
neck O
and O
face O
were O
as O
red O
as O
beetroot. O
The O
first O
to O
run O
up O
and O
drink O
was O
Dymov. O
He O
drank O
laughing, O
often O
turning O
from O
the O
pail O
to O
tell O
Kiruha O
something O
funny, O
then O
he O
turned O
round, O
and O
uttered O
aloud, O
to O
be O
heard O
all O
over O
the O
steppe, O
five O
very O
bad O
words. O
Yegorushka O
did O
not O
understand O
the O
meaning O
of O
such O
words, O
but O
he O
knew O
very O
well O
they O
were O
bad O
words. O
He O
knew O
the O
repulsion O
his O
friends O
and O
relations O
silently O
felt O
for O
such O
words. O
He O
himself, O
without O
knowing O
why, O
shared O
that O
feeling O
and O
was O
accustomed O
to O
think O
that O
only O
drunk O
and O
disorderly O
people O
enjoy O
the O
privilege O
of O
uttering O
such O
words O
aloud. O
He O
remembered O
the O
murder O
of O
the O
grass O
snake, O
listened O
to O
Dymov's O
laughter, O
and O
felt O
something O
like O
hatred O
for O
the O
man. O
And O
as O
ill-luck O
would O
have O
it, O
Dymov O
at O
that O
moment O
caught O
sight O
of O
Yegorushka, O
who O
had O
climbed O
down O
from O
the O
waggon O
and O
gone O
up O
to O
the O
well. O
He O
laughed O
aloud O
and O
shouted: O
"I O
say, O
lads, O
the O
old O
man O
has O
been O
brought O
to O
bed O
of O
a O
boy O
in O
the O
night!" O
Kiruha O
laughed O
his O
bass O
laugh O
till O
he O
coughed. O
Someone O
else O
laughed O
too, O
while O
Yegorushka O
crimsoned O
and O
made O
up O
his O
mind O
finally O
that O
Dymov O
was O
a O
very O
wicked O
man. O
With O
his O
curly O
flaxen O
head, O
with O
his O
shirt O
opened O
on O
his O
chest O
and O
no O
hat O
on, O
Dymov O
looked O
handsome O
and O
exceptionally O
strong; O
in O
every O
movement O
he O
made O
one O
could O
see O
the O
reckless O
dare-devil O
and O
athlete, O
knowing O
his O
value. O
He O
shrugged O
his O
shoulders, O
put O
his O
arms O
akimbo, O
talked O
and O
laughed O
louder O
than O
any O
of O
the O
rest, O
and O
looked O
as O
though O
he O
were O
going O
to O
lift O
up O
something O
very O
heavy O
with O
one O
hand O
and O
astonish O
the O
whole O
world O
by O
doing O
so. O
His O
mischievous O
mocking O
eyes O
glided O
over O
the O
road, O
the O
waggons, O
and O
the O
sky O
without O
resting O
on O
anything, O
and O
seemed O
looking O
for O
someone O
to O
kill, O
just O
as O
a O
pastime, O
and O
something O
to O
laugh O
at. O
Evidently O
he O
was O
afraid O
of O
no O
one, O
would O
stick O
at O
nothing, O
and O
most O
likely O
was O
not O
in O
the O
least O
interested O
in O
Yegorushka's O
opinion O
of O
him. O
. O
. O
. O
Yegorushka O
meanwhile O
hated O
his O
flaxen O
head, O
his O
clear O
face, O
and O
his O
strength O
with O
his O
whole O
heart, O
listened O
with O
fear O
and O
loathing O
to O
his O
laughter, O
and O
kept O
thinking O
what O
word O
of O
abuse O
he O
could O
pay O
him O
out O
with. O
Panteley, O
too, O
went O
up O
to O
the O
pail. O
He O
took O
out O
of O
his O
pocket O
a O
little O
green O
glass O
of O
an O
ikon O
lamp, O
wiped O
it O
with O
a O
rag, O
filled O
it O
from O
the O
pail O
and O
drank O
from O
it, O
then O
filled O
it O
again, O
wrapped O
the O
little O
glass O
in O
the O
rag, O
and O
then O
put O
it O
back O
into O
his O
pocket. O
"Grandfather, O
why O
do O
you O
drink O
out O
of O
a O
lamp?" O
Yegorushka O
asked O
him, O
surprised. O
"One O
man O
drinks O
out O
of O
a O
pail O
and O
another O
out O
of O
a O
lamp," O
the O
old O
man O
answered O
evasively. O
"Every O
man O
to O
his O
own O
taste. O
. O
. O
. O
You O
drink O
out O
of O
the O
pail-- O
well, O
drink, O
and O
may O
it O
do O
you O
good. O
. O
. O
." O
"You O
darling, O
you O
beauty!" O
Vassya O
said O
suddenly, O
in O
a O
caressing, O
plaintive O
voice. O
"You O
darling!" O
His O
eyes O
were O
fixed O
on O
the O
distance; O
they O
were O
moist O
and O
smiling, O
and O
his O
face O
wore O
the O
same O
expression O
as O
when O
he O
had O
looked O
at O
Yegorushka. O
"Who O
is O
it O
you O
are O
talking O
to?" O
asked O
Kiruha. O
"A O
darling O
fox, O
. O
. O
. O
lying O
on O
her O
back, O
playing O
like O
a O
dog." O
Everyone O
began O
staring O
into O
the O
distance, O
looking O
for O
the O
fox, O
but O
no O
one O
could O
see O
it, O
only O
Vassya O
with O
his O
grey O
muddy-looking O
eyes, O
and O
he O
was O
enchanted O
by O
it. O
His O
sight O
was O
extraordinarily O
keen, O
as O
Yegorushka O
learnt O
afterwards. O
He O
was O
so O
long-sighted O
that O
the O
brown O
steppe O
was O
for O
him O
always O
full O
of O
life O
and O
interest. O
He O
had O
only O
to O
look O
into O
the O
distance O
to O
see O
a O
fox, O
a O
hare, O
a O
bustard, O
or O
some O
other O
animal O
keeping O
at O
a O
distance O
from O
men. O
There O
was O
nothing O
strange O
in O
seeing O
a O
hare O
running O
away O
or O
a O
flying O
bustard-- O
everyone O
crossing O
the O
steppes O
could O
see O
them; O
but O
it O
was O
not O
vouchsafed O
to O
everyone O
to O
see O
wild O
animals O
in O
their O
own O
haunts O
when O
they O
were O
not O
running O
nor O
hiding, O
nor O
looking O
about O
them O
in O
alarm. O
Yet O
Vassya O
saw O
foxes O
playing, O
hares O
washing O
themselves O
with O
their O
paws, O
bustards O
preening O
their O
wings O
and O
hammering O
out O
their O
hollow O
nests. O
Thanks O
to O
this O
keenness O
of O
sight, O
Vassya O
had, O
besides O
the O
world O
seen O
by O
everyone, O
another O
world O
of O
his O
own, O
accessible O
to O
no O
one O
else, O
and O
probably O
a O
very O
beautiful O
one, O
for O
when O
he O
saw O
something O
and O
was O
in O
raptures O
over O
it O
it O
was O
impossible O
not O
to O
envy O
him. O
When O
the O
waggons O
set O
off O
again, O
the O
church O
bells O
were O
ringing O
for O
service. O
V O
The O
train O
of O
waggons O
drew O
up O
on O
the O
bank O
of O
a O
river O
on O
one O
side O
of O
a O
village. O
The O
sun O
was O
blazing, O
as O
it O
had O
been O
the O
day O
before; O
the O
air O
was O
stagnant O
and O
depressing. O
There O
were O
a O
few O
willows O
on O
the O
bank, O
but O
the O
shade O
from O
them O
did O
not O
fall O
on O
the O
earth, O
but O
on O
the O
water, O
where O
it O
was O
wasted; O
even O
in O
the O
shade O
under O
the O
waggon O
it O
was O
stifling O
and O
wearisome. O
The O
water, O
blue O
from O
the O
reflection O
of O
the O
sky O
in O
it, O
was O
alluring. O
Styopka, O
a O
waggoner O
whom O
Yegorushka O
noticed O
now O
for O
the O
first O
time, O
a O
Little O
Russian O
lad O
of O
eighteen, O
in O
a O
long O
shirt O
without O
a O
belt, O
and O
full O
trousers O
that O
flapped O
like O
flags O
as O
he O
walked, O
undressed O
quickly, O
ran O
along O
the O
steep O
bank O
and O
plunged O
into O
the O
water. O
He O
dived O
three O
times, O
then O
swam O
on O
his O
back O
and O
shut O
his O
eyes O
in O
his O
delight. O
His O
face O
was O
smiling O
and O
wrinkled O
up O
as O
though O
he O
were O
being O
tickled, O
hurt O
and O
amused. O
On O
a O
hot O
day O
when O
there O
is O
nowhere O
to O
escape O
from O
the O
sultry, O
stifling O
heat, O
the O
splash O
of O
water O
and O
the O
loud O
breathing O
of O
a O
man O
bathing O
sounds O
like O
good O
music O
to O
the O
ear. O
Dymov O
and O
Kiruha, O
looking O
at O
Styopka, O
undressed O
quickly O
and O
one O
after O
the O
other, O
laughing O
loudly O
in O
eager O
anticipation O
of O
their O
enjoyment, O
dropped O
into O
the O
water, O
and O
the O
quiet, O
modest O
little O
river O
resounded O
with O
snorting O
and O
splashing O
and O
shouting. O
Kiruha O
coughed, O
laughed O
and O
shouted O
as O
though O
they O
were O
trying O
to O
drown O
him, O
while O
Dymov O
chased O
him O
and O
tried O
to O
catch O
him O
by O
the O
leg. O
"Ha-ha-ha!" O
he O
shouted. O
"Catch O
him! O
Hold O
him!" O
Kiruha O
laughed O
and O
enjoyed O
himself, O
but O
his O
expression O
was O
the O
same O
as O
it O
had O
been O
on O
dry O
land, O
stupid, O
with O
a O
look O
of O
astonishment O
on O
it O
as O
though O
someone O
had, O
unnoticed, O
stolen O
up O
behind O
him O
and O
hit O
him O
on O
the O
head O
with O
the O
butt-end O
of O
an O
axe. O
Yegorushka O
undressed, O
too, O
but O
did O
not O
let O
himself O
down O
by O
the O
bank, O
but O
took O
a O
run O
and O
a O
flying O
leap O
from O
the O
height O
of O
about O
ten O
feet. O
Describing O
an O
arc O
in O
the O
air, O
he O
fell O
into O
the O
water, O
sank O
deep, O
but O
did O
not O
reach O
the O
bottom; O
some O
force, O
cold O
and O
pleasant O
to O
the O
touch, O
seemed O
to O
hold O
him O
up O
and O
bring O
him O
back O
to O
the O
surface. O
He O
popped O
out O
and, O
snorting O
and O
blowing O
bubbles, O
opened O
his O
eyes; O
but O
the O
sun O
was O
reflected O
in O
the O
water O
quite O
close O
to O
his O
face. O
At O
first O
blinding O
spots O
of O
light, O
then O
rainbow O
colours O
and O
dark O
patches, O
flitted O
before O
his O
eyes. O
He O
made O
haste O
to O
dive O
again, O
opened O
his O
eyes O
in O
the O
water O
and O
saw O
something O
cloudy-green O
like O
a O
sky O
on O
a O
moonlight O
night. O
Again O
the O
same O
force O
would O
not O
let O
him O
touch O
the O
bottom O
and O
stay O
in O
the O
coolness, O
but O
lifted O
him O
to O
the O
surface. O
He O
popped O
out O
and O
heaved O
a O
sigh O
so O
deep O
that O
he O
had O
a O
feeling O
of O
space O
and O
freshness, O
not O
only O
in O
his O
chest, O
but O
in O
his O
stomach. O
Then, O
to O
get O
from O
the O
water O
everything O
he O
possibly O
could O
get, O
he O
allowed O
himself O
every O
luxury; O
he O
lay O
on O
his O
back O
and O
basked, O
splashed, O
frolicked, O
swam O
on O
his O
face, O
on O
his O
side, O
on O
his O
back O
and O
standing O
up-- O
just O
as O
he O
pleased O
till O
he O
was O
exhausted. O
The O
other O
bank O
was O
thickly O
overgrown O
with O
reeds; O
it O
was O
golden O
in O
the O
sun, O
and O
the O
flowers O
of O
the O
reeds O
hung O
drooping O
to O
the O
water O
in O
lovely O
tassels. O
In O
one O
place O
the O
reeds O
were O
shaking O
and O
nodding, O
with O
their O
flowers O
rustling-- O
Styopka O
and O
Kiruha O
were O
hunting O
crayfish. O
"A O
crayfish, O
look, O
lads! O
A O
crayfish!" O
Kiruha O
cried O
triumphantly O
and O
actually O
showed O
a O
crayfish. O
Yegorushka O
swam O
up O
to O
the O
reeds, O
dived, O
and O
began O
fumbling O
among O
their O
roots. O
Burrowing O
in O
the O
slimy, O
liquid O
mud, O
he O
felt O
something O
sharp O
and O
unpleasant-- O
perhaps O
it O
really O
was O
a O
crayfish. O
But O
at O
that O
minute O
someone O
seized O
him O
by O
the O
leg O
and O
pulled O
him O
to O
the O
surface. O
Spluttering O
and O
coughing, O
Yegorushka O
opened O
his O
eyes O
and O
saw O
before O
him O
the O
wet O
grinning O
face O
of O
the O
dare-devil O
Dymov. O
The O
impudent O
fellow O
was O
breathing O
hard, O
and O
from O
a O
look O
in O
his O
eyes O
he O
seemed O
inclined O
for O
further O
mischief. O
He O
held O
Yegorushka O
tight O
by O
the O
leg, O
and O
was O
lifting O
his O
hand O
to O
take O
hold O
of O
his O
neck. O
But O
Yegorushka O
tore O
himself O
away O
with O
repulsion O
and O
terror, O
as O
though O
disgusted O
at O
being O
touched O
and O
afraid O
that O
the O
bully O
would O
drown O
him, O
and O
said: O
"Fool! O
I'll O
punch O
you O
in O
the O
face." O
Feeling O
that O
this O
was O
not O
sufficient O
to O
express O
his O
hatred, O
he O
thought O
a O
minute O
and O
added: O
"You O
blackguard! O
You O
son O
of O
a O
bitch!" O
But O
Dymov, O
as O
though O
nothing O
were O
the O
matter, O
took O
no O
further O
notice O
of O
Yegorushka, O
but O
swam O
off O
to O
Kiruha, O
shouting: O
"Ha-ha-ha! O
Let O
us O
catch O
fish! O
Mates, O
let O
us O
catch O
fish." O
"To O
be O
sure," O
Kiruha O
agreed; O
"there O
must O
be O
a O
lot O
of O
fish O
here." O
"Styopka, O
run O
to O
the O
village O
and O
ask O
the O
peasants O
for O
a O
net! O
 O
They O
won't O
give O
it O
to O
me." O
"They O
will, O
you O
ask O
them. O
Tell O
them O
that O
they O
should O
give O
it O
to O
us O
for O
Christ's O
sake, O
because O
we O
are O
just O
the O
same O
as O
pilgrims." O
"That's O
true." O
Styopka O
clambered O
out O
of O
the O
water, O
dressed O
quickly, O
and O
without O
a O
cap O
on O
he O
ran, O
his O
full O
trousers O
flapping, O
to O
the O
village. O
The O
water O
lost O
all O
its O
charm O
for O
Yegorushka O
after O
his O
encounter O
with O
Dymov. O
He O
got O
out O
and O
began O
dressing. O
Panteley O
and O
Vassya O
were O
sitting O
on O
the O
steep O
bank, O
with O
their O
legs O
hanging O
down, O
looking O
at O
the O
bathers. O
Emelyan O
was O
standing O
naked, O
up O
to O
his O
knees O
in O
the O
water, O
holding O
on O
to O
the O
grass O
with O
one O
hand O
to O
prevent O
himself O
from O
falling O
while O
the O
other O
stroked O
his O
body. O
With O
his O
bony O
shoulder-blades, O
with O
the O
swelling O
under O
his O
eye, O
bending O
down O
and O
evidently O
afraid O
of O
the O
water, O
he O
made O
a O
ludicrous O
figure. O
His O
face O
was O
grave O
and O
severe. O
He O
looked O
angrily O
at O
the O
water, O
as O
though O
he O
were O
just O
going O
to O
upbraid O
it O
for O
having O
given O
him O
cold O
in O
the O
Donets O
and O
robbed O
him O
of O
his O
voice. O
"And O
why O
don't O
you O
bathe?" O
Yegorushka O
asked O
Vassya. O
"Oh, O
I O
don't O
care O
for O
it, O
. O
. O
." O
answered O
Vassya. O
"How O
is O
it O
your O
chin O
is O
swollen?" O
"It's O
bad. O
. O
. O
. O
I O
used O
to O
work O
at O
the O
match O
factory, O
little O
sir. O
. O
. O
. O
The O
doctor O
used O
to O
say O
that O
it O
would O
make O
my O
jaw O
rot. O
The O
air O
is O
not O
healthy O
there. O
There O
were O
three O
chaps O
beside O
me O
who O
had O
their O
jaws O
swollen, O
and O
with O
one O
of O
them O
it O
rotted O
away O
altogether." O
Styopka O
soon O
came O
back O
with O
the O
net. O
Dymov O
and O
Kiruha O
were O
already O
turning O
blue O
and O
getting O
hoarse O
by O
being O
so O
long O
in O
the O
water, O
but O
they O
set O
about O
fishing O
eagerly. O
First O
they O
went O
to O
a O
deep O
place O
beside O
the O
reeds; O
there O
Dymov O
was O
up O
to O
his O
neck, O
while O
the O
water O
went O
over O
squat O
Kiruha's O
head. O
The O
latter O
spluttered O
and O
blew O
bubbles, O
while O
Dymov O
stumbling O
on O
the O
prickly O
roots, O
fell O
over O
and O
got O
caught O
in O
the O
net; O
both O
flopped O
about O
in O
the O
water, O
and O
made O
a O
noise, O
and O
nothing O
but O
mischief O
came O
of O
their O
fishing. O
"It's O
deep," O
croaked O
Kiruha. O
"You O
won't O
catch O
anything." O
"Don't O
tug, O
you O
devil!" O
shouted O
Dymov O
trying O
to O
put O
the O
net O
in O
the O
proper O
position. O
"Hold O
it O
up." O
"You O
won't O
catch O
anything O
here," O
Panteley O
shouted O
from O
the O
bank. O
"You O
are O
only O
frightening O
the O
fish, O
you O
stupids! O
Go O
more O
to O
the O
left! O
It's O
shallower O
there!" O
Once O
a O
big O
fish O
gleamed O
above O
the O
net; O
they O
all O
drew O
a O
breath, O
and O
Dymov O
struck O
the O
place O
where O
it O
had O
vanished O
with O
his O
fist, O
and O
his O
face O
expressed O
vexation. O
"Ugh!" O
cried O
Panteley, O
and O
he O
stamped O
his O
foot. O
"You've O
let O
the O
perch O
slip! O
It's O
gone!" O
Moving O
more O
to O
the O
left, O
Dymov O
and O
Kiruha O
picked O
out O
a O
shallower O
place, O
and O
then O
fishing O
began O
in O
earnest. O
They O
had O
wandered O
off O
some O
hundred O
paces O
from O
the O
waggons; O
they O
could O
be O
seen O
silently O
trying O
to O
go O
as O
deep O
as O
they O
could O
and O
as O
near O
the O
reeds, O
moving O
their O
legs O
a O
little O
at O
a O
time, O
drawing O
out O
the O
nets, O
beating O
the O
water O
with O
their O
fists O
to O
drive O
them O
towards O
the O
nets. O
From O
the O
reeds O
they O
got O
to O
the O
further O
bank; O
they O
drew O
the O
net O
out, O
then, O
with O
a O
disappointed O
air, O
lifting O
their O
knees O
high O
as O
they O
walked, O
went O
back O
into O
the O
reeds. O
They O
were O
talking O
about O
something, O
but O
what O
it O
was O
no O
one O
could O
hear. O
The O
sun O
was O
scorching O
their O
backs, O
the O
flies O
were O
stinging O
them, O
and O
their O
bodies O
had O
turned O
from O
purple O
to O
crimson. O
Styopka O
was O
walking O
after O
them O
with O
a O
pail O
in O
his O
hands; O
he O
had O
tucked O
his O
shirt O
right O
up O
under O
his O
armpits, O
and O
was O
holding O
it O
up O
by O
the O
hem O
with O
his O
teeth. O
After O
every O
successful O
catch O
he O
lifted O
up O
some O
fish, O
and O
letting O
it O
shine O
in O
the O
sun, O
shouted: O
"Look O
at O
this O
perch! O
We've O
five O
like O
that!" O
Every O
time O
Dymov, O
Kiruha O
and O
Styopka O
pulled O
out O
the O
net O
they O
could O
be O
seen O
fumbling O
about O
in O
the O
mud O
in O
it, O
putting O
some O
things O
into O
the O
pail O
and O
throwing O
other O
things O
away; O
sometimes O
they O
passed O
something O
that O
was O
in O
the O
net O
from O
hand O
to O
hand, O
examined O
it O
inquisitively, O
then O
threw O
that, O
too, O
away. O
"What O
is O
it?" O
they O
shouted O
to O
them O
from O
the O
bank. O
Styopka O
made O
some O
answer, O
but O
it O
was O
hard O
to O
make O
out O
his O
words. O
Then O
he O
climbed O
out O
of O
the O
water O
and, O
holding O
the O
pail O
in O
both O
hands, O
forgetting O
to O
let O
his O
shirt O
drop, O
ran O
to O
the O
waggons. O
"It's O
full!" O
he O
shouted, O
breathing O
hard. O
"Give O
us O
another!" O
Yegorushka O
looked O
into O
the O
pail: O
it O
was O
full. O
A O
young O
pike O
poked O
its O
ugly O
nose O
out O
of O
the O
water, O
and O
there O
were O
swarms O
of O
crayfish O
and O
little O
fish O
round O
about O
it. O
Yegorushka O
put O
his O
hand O
down O
to O
the O
bottom O
and O
stirred O
up O
the O
water; O
the O
pike O
vanished O
under O
the O
crayfish O
and O
a O
perch O
and O
a O
tench O
swam O
to O
the O
surface O
instead O
of O
it. O
Vassya, O
too, O
looked O
into O
the O
pail. O
His O
eyes O
grew O
moist O
and O
his O
face O
looked O
as O
caressing O
as O
before O
when O
he O
saw O
the O
fox. O
He O
took O
something O
out O
of O
the O
pail, O
put O
it O
to O
his O
mouth O
and O
began O
chewing O
it. O
"Mates," O
said O
Styopka O
in O
amazement, O
"Vassya O
is O
eating O
a O
live O
gudgeon! O
Phoo!" O
"It's O
not O
a O
gudgeon, O
but O
a O
minnow," O
Vassya O
answered O
calmly, O
still O
munching. O
He O
took O
a O
fish's O
tail O
out O
of O
his O
mouth, O
looked O
at O
it O
caressingly, O
and O
put O
it O
back O
again. O
While O
he O
was O
chewing O
and O
crunching O
with O
his O
teeth O
it O
seemed O
to O
Yegorushka O
that O
he O
saw O
before O
him O
something O
not O
human. O
Vassya's O
swollen O
chin, O
his O
lustreless O
eyes, O
his O
extraordinary O
sharp O
sight, O
the O
fish's O
tail O
in O
his O
mouth, O
and O
the O
caressing O
friendliness O
with O
which O
he O
crunched O
the O
gudgeon O
made O
him O
like O
an O
animal. O
Yegorushka O
felt O
dreary O
beside O
him. O
And O
the O
fishing O
was O
over, O
too. O
He O
walked O
about O
beside O
the O
waggons, O
thought O
a O
little, O
and, O
feeling O
bored, O
strolled O
off O
to O
the O
village. O
Not O
long O
afterwards O
he O
was O
standing O
in O
the O
church, O
and O
with O
his O
forehead O
leaning O
on O
somebody's O
back, O
listened O
to O
the O
singing O
of O
the O
choir. O
The O
service O
was O
drawing O
to O
a O
close. O
Yegorushka O
did O
not O
understand O
church O
singing O
and O
did O
not O
care O
for O
it. O
He O
listened O
a O
little, O
yawned, O
and O
began O
looking O
at O
the O
backs O
and O
heads O
before O
him. O
In O
one O
head, O
red O
and O
wet O
from O
his O
recent O
bathe, O
he O
recognized O
Emelyan. O
The O
back O
of O
his O
head O
had O
been O
cropped O
in O
a O
straight O
line O
higher O
than O
is O
usual; O
the O
hair O
in O
front O
had O
been O
cut O
unbecomingly O
high, O
and O
Emelyan's O
ears O
stood O
out O
like O
two O
dock O
leaves, O
and O
seemed O
to O
feel O
themselves O
out O
of O
place. O
Looking O
at O
the O
back O
of O
his O
head O
and O
his O
ears, O
Yegorushka, O
for O
some O
reason, O
thought O
that O
Emelyan O
was O
probably O
very O
unhappy. O
He O
remembered O
the O
way O
he O
conducted O
with O
his O
hands, O
his O
husky O
voice, O
his O
timid O
air O
when O
he O
was O
bathing, O
and O
felt O
intense O
pity O
for O
him. O
He O
longed O
to O
say O
something O
friendly O
to O
him. O
"I O
am O
here, O
too," O
he O
said, O
putting O
out O
his O
hand. O
People O
who O
sing O
tenor O
or O
bass O
in O
the O
choir, O
especially O
those O
who O
have O
at O
any O
time O
in O
their O
lives O
conducted, O
are O
accustomed O
to O
look O
with O
a O
stern O
and O
unfriendly O
air O
at O
boys. O
They O
do O
not O
give O
up O
this O
habit, O
even O
when O
they O
leave O
off O
being O
in O
a O
choir. O
Turning O
to O
Yegorushka, O
Emelyan O
looked O
at O
him O
from O
under O
his O
brows O
and O
said: O
"Don't O
play O
in O
church!" O
Then O
Yegorushka O
moved O
forwards O
nearer O
to O
the O
ikon-stand. O
Here O
he O
saw O
interesting O
people. O
On O
the O
right O
side, O
in O
front O
of O
everyone, O
a O
lady O
and O
a O
gentleman O
were O
standing O
on O
a O
carpet. O
There O
were O
chairs O
behind O
them. O
The O
gentleman O
was O
wearing O
newly O
ironed O
shantung O
trousers; O
he O
stood O
as O
motionless O
as O
a O
soldier O
saluting, O
and O
held O
high O
his O
bluish O
shaven O
chin. O
There O
was O
a O
very O
great O
air O
of O
dignity O
in O
his O
stand-up O
collar, O
in O
his O
blue O
chin, O
in O
his O
small O
bald O
patch O
and O
his O
cane. O
His O
neck O
was O
so O
strained O
from O
excess O
of O
dignity, O
and O
his O
chin O
was O
drawn O
up O
so O
tensely, O
that O
it O
looked O
as O
though O
his O
head O
were O
ready O
to O
fly O
off O
and O
soar O
upwards O
any O
minute. O
The O
lady, O
who O
was O
stout O
and O
elderly O
and O
wore O
a O
white O
silk O
shawl, O
held O
her O
head O
on O
one O
side O
and O
looked O
as O
though O
she O
had O
done O
someone O
a O
favour, O
and O
wanted O
to O
say: O
"Oh, O
don't O
trouble O
yourself O
to O
thank O
me; O
I O
don't O
like O
it O
. O
. O
. O
." O
A O
thick O
wall O
of O
Little O
Russian O
heads O
stood O
all O
round O
the O
carpet. O
Yegorushka O
went O
up O
to O
the O
ikon-stand O
and O
began O
kissing O
the O
local O
ikons. O
Before O
each O
image O
he O
slowly O
bowed O
down O
to O
the O
ground, O
without O
getting O
up, O
looked O
round O
at O
the O
congregation, O
then O
got O
up O
and O
kissed O
the O
ikon. O
The O
contact O
of O
his O
forehead O
with O
the O
cold O
floor O
afforded O
him O
great O
satisfaction. O
When O
the O
beadle O
came O
from O
the O
altar O
with O
a O
pair O
of O
long O
snuffers O
to O
put O
out O
the O
candles, O
Yegorushka O
jumped O
up O
quickly O
from O
the O
floor O
and O
ran O
up O
to O
him. O
"Have O
they O
given O
out O
the O
holy O
bread?" O
he O
asked. O
"There O
is O
none; O
there O
is O
none," O
the O
beadle O
muttered O
gruffly. O
"It O
is O
no O
use O
your. O
. O
." O
The O
service O
was O
over; O
Yegorushka O
walked O
out O
of O
the O
church O
in O
a O
leisurely O
way, O
and O
began O
strolling O
about O
the O
market-place. O
He O
had O
seen O
a O
good O
many O
villages, O
market-places, O
and O
peasants O
in O
his O
time, O
and O
everything O
that O
met O
his O
eyes O
was O
entirely O
without O
interest O
for O
him. O
At O
a O
loss O
for O
something O
to O
do, O
he O
went O
into O
a O
shop O
over O
the O
door O
of O
which O
hung O
a O
wide O
strip O
of O
red O
cotton. O
The O
shop O
consisted O
of O
two O
roomy, O
badly O
lighted O
parts; O
in O
one O
half O
they O
sold O
drapery O
and O
groceries, O
in O
the O
other O
there O
were O
tubs O
of O
tar, O
and O
there O
were O
horse-collars O
hanging O
from O
the O
ceiling; O
from O
both O
came O
the O
savoury O
smell O
of O
leather O
and O
tar. O
The O
floor O
of O
the O
shop O
had O
been O
watered; O
the O
man O
who O
watered O
it O
must O
have O
been O
a O
very O
whimsical O
and O
original O
person, O
for O
it O
was O
sprinkled O
in O
patterns O
and O
mysterious O
symbols. O
The O
shopkeeper, O
an O
overfed-looking O
man O
with O
a O
broad O
face O
and O
round O
beard, O
apparently O
a O
Great O
Russian, O
was O
standing, O
leaning O
his O
person O
over O
the O
counter. O
He O
was O
nibbling O
a O
piece O
of O
sugar O
as O
he O
drank O
his O
tea, O
and O
heaved O
a O
deep O
sigh O
at O
every O
sip. O
His O
face O
expressed O
complete O
indifference, O
but O
each O
sigh O
seemed O
to O
be O
saying: O
"Just O
wait O
a O
minute; O
I O
will O
give O
it O
you." O
"Give O
me O
a O
farthing's O
worth O
of O
sunflower O
seeds," O
Yegorushka O
said, O
addressing O
him. O
The O
shopkeeper O
raised O
his O
eyebrows, O
came O
out O
from O
behind O
the O
counter, O
and O
poured O
a O
farthing's O
worth O
of O
sunflower O
seeds O
into O
Yegorushka's O
pocket, O
using O
an O
empty O
pomatum O
pot O
as O
a O
measure. O
Yegorushka O
did O
not O
want O
to O
go O
away. O
He O
spent O
a O
long O
time O
in O
examining O
the O
box O
of O
cakes, O
thought O
a O
little O
and O
asked, O
pointing O
to O
some O
little O
cakes O
covered O
with O
the O
mildew O
of O
age: O
"How O
much O
are O
these O
cakes?" O
"Two O
for O
a O
farthing." O
Yegorushka O
took O
out O
of O
his O
pocket O
the O
cake O
given O
him O
the O
day O
before O
by O
the O
Jewess, O
and O
asked O
him: O
"And O
how O
much O
do O
you O
charge O
for O
cakes O
like O
this?" O
The O
shopman O
took O
the O
cake O
in O
his O
hands, O
looked O
at O
it O
from O
all O
sides, O
and O
raised O
one O
eyebrow. O
"Like O
that?" O
he O
asked. O
Then O
he O
raised O
the O
other O
eyebrow, O
thought O
a O
minute, O
and O
answered: O
"Two O
for O
three O
farthings. O
. O
. O
." O
A O
silence O
followed. O
"Whose O
boy O
are O
you?" O
the O
shopman O
asked, O
pouring O
himself O
out O
some O
tea O
from O
a O
red O
copper O
teapot. O
"The O
nephew O
of O
Ivan O
Ivanitch." O
"There O
are O
all O
sorts O
of O
Ivan O
Ivanitchs," O
the O
shopkeeper O
sighed. O
He O
looked O
over O
Yegorushka's O
head O
towards O
the O
door, O
paused O
a O
minute O
and O
asked: O
"Would O
you O
like O
some O
tea?" O
"Please. O
. O
. O
." O
Yegorushka O
assented O
not O
very O
readily, O
though O
he O
felt O
an O
intense O
longing O
for O
his O
usual O
morning O
tea. O
The O
shopkeeper O
poured O
him O
out O
a O
glass O
and O
gave O
him O
with O
it O
a O
bit O
of O
sugar O
that O
looked O
as O
though O
it O
had O
been O
nibbled. O
Yegorushka O
sat O
down O
on O
the O
folding O
chair O
and O
began O
drinking O
it. O
He O
wanted O
to O
ask O
the O
price O
of O
a O
pound O
of O
sugar O
almonds, O
and O
had O
just O
broached O
the O
subject O
when O
a O
customer O
walked O
in, O
and O
the O
shopkeeper, O
leaving O
his O
glass O
of O
tea, O
attended O
to O
his O
business. O
He O
led O
the O
customer O
into O
the O
other O
half, O
where O
there O
was O
a O
smell O
of O
tar, O
and O
was O
there O
a O
long O
time O
discussing O
something O
with O
him. O
The O
customer, O
a O
man O
apparently O
very O
obstinate O
and O
pig-headed, O
was O
continually O
shaking O
his O
head O
to O
signify O
his O
disapproval, O
and O
retreating O
towards O
the O
door. O
The O
shopkeeper O
tried O
to O
persuade O
him O
of O
something O
and O
began O
pouring O
some O
oats O
into O
a O
big O
sack O
for O
him. O
"Do O
you O
call O
those O
oats?" O
the O
customer O
said O
gloomily. O
"Those O
are O
not O
oats, O
but O
chaff. O
It's O
a O
mockery O
to O
give O
that O
to O
the O
hens; O
enough O
to O
make O
the O
hens O
laugh. O
. O
. O
. O
No, O
I O
will O
go O
to O
Bondarenko." O
When O
Yegorushka O
went O
back O
to O
the O
river O
a O
small O
camp O
fire O
was O
smoking O
on O
the O
bank. O
The O
waggoners O
were O
cooking O
their O
dinner. O
Styopka O
was O
standing O
in O
the O
smoke, O
stirring O
the O
cauldron O
with O
a O
big O
notched O
spoon. O
A O
little O
on O
one O
side O
Kiruha O
and O
Vassya, O
with O
eyes O
reddened O
from O
the O
smoke, O
were O
sitting O
cleaning O
the O
fish. O
Before O
them O
lay O
the O
net O
covered O
with O
slime O
and O
water O
weeds, O
and O
on O
it O
lay O
gleaming O
fish O
and O
crawling O
crayfish. O
Emelyan, O
who O
had O
not O
long O
been O
back O
from O
the O
church, O
was O
sitting O
beside O
Panteley, O
waving O
his O
arm O
and O
humming O
just O
audibly O
in O
a O
husky O
voice: O
"To O
Thee O
we O
sing. O
. O
. O
." O
Dymov O
was O
moving O
about O
by O
the O
horses. O
When O
they O
had O
finished O
cleaning O
them, O
Kiruha O
and O
Vassya O
put O
the O
fish O
and O
the O
living O
crayfish O
together O
in O
the O
pail, O
rinsed O
them, O
and O
from O
the O
pail O
poured O
them O
all O
into O
the O
boiling O
water. O
"Shall O
I O
put O
in O
some O
fat?" O
asked O
Styopka, O
skimming O
off O
the O
froth. O
"No O
need. O
The O
fish O
will O
make O
its O
own O
gravy," O
answered O
Kiruha. O
Before O
taking O
the O
cauldron O
off O
the O
fire O
Styopka O
scattered O
into O
the O
water O
three O
big O
handfuls O
of O
millet O
and O
a O
spoonful O
of O
salt; O
finally O
he O
tried O
it, O
smacked O
his O
lips, O
licked O
the O
spoon, O
and O
gave O
a O
self-satisfied O
grunt, O
which O
meant O
that O
the O
grain O
was O
done. O
All O
except O
Panteley O
sat O
down O
near O
the O
cauldron O
and O
set O
to O
work O
with O
their O
spoons. O
"You O
there! O
Give O
the O
little O
lad O
a O
spoon!" O
Panteley O
observed O
sternly. O
"I O
dare O
say O
he O
is O
hungry O
too!" O
"Ours O
is O
peasant O
fare," O
sighed O
Kiruha. O
"Peasant O
fare O
is O
welcome, O
too, O
when O
one O
is O
hungry." O
They O
gave O
Yegorushka O
a O
spoon. O
He O
began O
eating, O
not O
sitting, O
but O
standing O
close O
to O
the O
cauldron O
and O
looking O
down O
into O
it O
as O
in O
a O
hole. O
The O
grain O
smelt O
of O
fish O
and O
fish-scales O
were O
mixed O
up O
with O
the O
millet. O
The O
crayfish O
could O
not O
be O
hooked O
out O
with O
a O
spoon, O
and O
the O
men O
simply O
picked O
them O
out O
of O
the O
cauldron O
with O
their O
hands; O
Vassya O
did O
so O
particularly O
freely, O
and O
wetted O
his O
sleeves O
as O
well O
as O
his O
hands O
in O
the O
mess. O
But O
yet O
the O
stew O
seemed O
to O
Yegorushka O
very O
nice, O
and O
reminded O
him O
of O
the O
crayfish O
soup O
which O
his O
mother O
used O
to O
make O
at O
home O
on O
fast-days. O
Panteley O
was O
sitting O
apart O
munching O
bread. O
"Grandfather, O
why O
aren't O
you O
eating?" O
Emelyan O
asked O
him. O
"I O
don't O
eat O
crayfish. O
. O
. O
. O
Nasty O
things," O
the O
old O
man O
said, O
and O
turned O
away O
with O
disgust. O
While O
they O
were O
eating O
they O
all O
talked. O
From O
this O
conversation O
Yegorushka O
gathered O
that O
all O
his O
new O
acquaintances, O
in O
spite O
of O
the O
differences O
of O
their O
ages O
and O
their O
characters, O
had O
one O
point O
in O
common O
which O
made O
them O
all O
alike: O
they O
were O
all O
people O
with O
a O
splendid O
past O
and O
a O
very O
poor O
present. O
Of O
their O
past O
they O
all-- O
every O
one O
of O
them-- O
spoke O
with O
enthusiasm; O
their O
attitude O
to O
the O
present O
was O
almost O
one O
of O
contempt. O
The O
Russian O
loves O
recalling O
life, O
but O
he O
does O
not O
love O
living. O
Yegorushka O
did O
not O
yet O
know O
that, O
and O
before O
the O
stew O
had O
been O
all O
eaten O
he O
firmly O
believed O
that O
the O
men O
sitting O
round O
the O
cauldron O
were O
the O
injured O
victims O
of O
fate. O
Panteley O
told O
them O
that O
in O
the O
past, O
before O
there O
were O
railways, O
he O
used O
to O
go O
with O
trains O
of O
waggons O
to O
Moscow O
and O
to O
Nizhni, O
and O
used O
to O
earn O
so O
much O
that O
he O
did O
not O
know O
what O
to O
do O
with O
his O
money; O
and O
what O
merchants O
there O
used O
to O
be O
in O
those O
days! O
what O
fish! O
how O
cheap O
everything O
was! O
Now O
the O
roads O
were O
shorter, O
the O
merchants O
were O
stingier, O
the O
peasants O
were O
poorer, O
the O
bread O
was O
dearer, O
everything O
had O
shrunk O
and O
was O
on O
a O
smaller O
scale. O
Emelyan O
told O
them O
that O
in O
old O
days O
he O
had O
been O
in O
the O
choir O
in O
the O
Lugansky O
works, O
and O
that O
he O
had O
a O
remarkable O
voice O
and O
read O
music O
splendidly, O
while O
now O
he O
had O
become O
a O
peasant O
and O
lived O
on O
the O
charity O
of O
his O
brother, O
who O
sent O
him O
out O
with O
his O
horses O
and O
took O
half O
his O
earnings. O
Vassya O
had O
once O
worked O
in O
a O
match O
factory; O
Kiruha O
had O
been O
a O
coachman O
in O
a O
good O
family, O
and O
had O
been O
reckoned O
the O
smartest O
driver O
of O
a O
three-in-hand O
in O
the O
whole O
district. O
Dymov, O
the O
son O
of O
a O
well-to-do O
peasant, O
lived O
at O
ease, O
enjoyed O
himself O
and O
had O
known O
no O
trouble O
till O
he O
was O
twenty, O
when O
his O
stern O
harsh O
father, O
anxious O
to O
train O
him O
to O
work, O
and O
afraid O
he O
would O
be O
spoiled O
at O
home, O
had O
sent O
him O
to O
a O
carrier's O
to O
work O
as O
a O
hired O
labourer. O
Styopka O
was O
the O
only O
one O
who O
said O
nothing, O
but O
from O
his O
beardless O
face O
it O
was O
evident O
that O
his O
life O
had O
been O
a O
much O
better O
one O
in O
the O
past. O
Thinking O
of O
his O
father, O
Dymov O
frowned O
and O
left O
off O
eating. O
Sullenly O
from O
under O
his O
brows O
he O
looked O
round O
at O
his O
companions O
and O
his O
eye O
rested O
upon O
Yegorushka. O
"You O
heathen, O
take O
off O
your O
cap," O
he O
said O
rudely. O
"You O
can't O
eat O
with O
your O
cap O
on, O
and O
you O
a O
gentleman O
too!" O
Yegorushka O
took O
off O
his O
hat O
and O
did O
not O
say O
a O
word, O
but O
the O
stew O
lost O
all O
savour O
for O
him, O
and O
he O
did O
not O
hear O
Panteley O
and O
Vassya O
intervening O
on O
his O
behalf. O
A O
feeling O
of O
anger O
with O
the O
insulting O
fellow O
was O
rankling O
oppressively O
in O
his O
breast, O
and O
he O
made O
up O
his O
mind O
that O
he O
would O
do O
him O
some O
injury, O
whatever O
it O
cost O
him. O
After O
dinner O
everyone O
sauntered O
to O
the O
waggons O
and O
lay O
down O
in O
the O
shade. O
"Are O
we O
going O
to O
start O
soon, O
grandfather?" O
Yegorushka O
asked O
Panteley. O
"In O
God's O
good O
time O
we O
shall O
set O
off. O
There's O
no O
starting O
yet; O
it O
is O
too O
hot. O
. O
. O
. O
O O
Lord, O
Thy O
will O
be O
done. O
Holy O
Mother. O
. O
. O
Lie O
down, O
little O
lad." O
Soon O
there O
was O
a O
sound O
of O
snoring O
from O
under O
the O
waggons. O
Yegorushka O
meant O
to O
go O
back O
to O
the O
village, O
but O
on O
consideration, O
yawned O
and O
lay O
down O
by O
the O
old O
man. O
VI O
The O
waggons O
remained O
by O
the O
river O
the O
whole O
day, O
and O
set O
off O
again O
when O
the O
sun O
was O
setting. O
Yegorushka O
was O
lying O
on O
the O
bales O
again; O
the O
waggon O
creaked O
softly O
and O
swayed O
from O
side O
to O
side. O
Panteley O
walked O
below, O
stamping O
his O
feet, O
slapping O
himself O
on O
his O
thighs O
and O
muttering. O
The O
air O
was O
full O
of O
the O
churring O
music O
of O
the O
steppes, O
as O
it O
had O
been O
the O
day O
before. O
Yegorushka O
lay O
on O
his O
back, O
and, O
putting O
his O
hands O
under O
his O
head, O
gazed O
upwards O
at O
the O
sky. O
He O
watched O
the O
glow O
of O
sunset O
kindle, O
then O
fade O
away; O
guardian O
angels O
covering O
the O
horizon O
with O
their O
gold O
wings O
disposed O
themselves O
to O
slumber. O
The O
day O
had O
passed O
peacefully; O
the O
quiet O
peaceful O
night O
had O
come, O
and O
they O
could O
stay O
tranquilly O
at O
home O
in O
heaven. O
. O
. O
. O
Yegorushka O
saw O
the O
sky O
by O
degrees O
grow O
dark O
and O
the O
mist O
fall O
over O
the O
earth-- O
saw O
the O
stars O
light O
up, O
one O
after O
the O
other. O
. O
. O
. O
When O
you O
gaze O
a O
long O
while O
fixedly O
at O
the O
deep O
sky O
thoughts O
and O
feelings O
for O
some O
reason O
merge O
in O
a O
sense O
of O
loneliness. O
One O
begins O
to O
feel O
hopelessly O
solitary, O
and O
everything O
one O
used O
to O
look O
upon O
as O
near O
and O
akin O
becomes O
infinitely O
remote O
and O
valueless; O
the O
stars O
that O
have O
looked O
down O
from O
the O
sky O
thousands O
of O
years O
already, O
the O
mists O
and O
the O
incomprehensible O
sky O
itself, O
indifferent O
to O
the O
brief O
life O
of O
man, O
oppress O
the O
soul O
with O
their O
silence O
when O
one O
is O
left O
face O
to O
face O
with O
them O
and O
tries O
to O
grasp O
their O
significance. O
One O
is O
reminded O
of O
the O
solitude O
awaiting O
each O
one O
of O
us O
in O
the O
grave, O
and O
the O
reality O
of O
life O
seems O
awful O
. O
. O
. O
full O
of O
despair. O
. O
. O
. O
Yegorushka O
thought O
of O
his O
grandmother, O
who O
was O
sleeping O
now O
under O
the O
cherry-trees O
in O
the O
cemetery. O
He O
remembered O
how O
she O
lay O
in O
her O
coffin O
with O
pennies O
on O
her O
eyes, O
how O
afterwards O
she O
was O
shut O
in O
and O
let O
down O
into O
the O
grave; O
he O
even O
recalled O
the O
hollow O
sound O
of O
the O
clods O
of O
earth O
on O
the O
coffin O
lid. O
. O
. O
. O
He O
pictured O
his O
granny O
in O
the O
dark O
and O
narrow O
coffin, O
helpless O
and O
deserted O
by O
everyone. O
His O
imagination O
pictured O
his O
granny O
suddenly O
awakening, O
not O
understanding O
where O
she O
was, O
knocking O
upon O
the O
lid O
and O
calling O
for O
help, O
and O
in O
the O
end O
swooning O
with O
horror O
and O
dying O
again. O
He O
imagined O
his O
mother O
dead, O
Father O
Christopher, O
Countess O
Dranitsky, O
Solomon. O
But O
however O
much O
he O
tried O
to O
imagine O
himself O
in O
the O
dark O
tomb, O
far O
from O
home, O
outcast, O
helpless O
and O
dead, O
he O
could O
not O
succeed; O
for O
himself O
personally O
he O
could O
not O
admit O
the O
possibility O
of O
death, O
and O
felt O
that O
he O
would O
never O
die. O
. O
. O
. O
Panteley, O
for O
whom O
death O
could O
not O
be O
far O
away, O
walked O
below O
and O
went O
on O
reckoning O
up O
his O
thoughts. O
"All O
right. O
. O
. O
. O
Nice O
gentlefolk, O
. O
. O
." O
he O
muttered. O
"Took O
his O
little O
lad O
to O
school-- O
but O
how O
he O
is O
doing O
now O
I O
haven't O
heard O
say O
--in O
Slavyanoserbsk. O
I O
say O
there O
is O
no O
establishment O
for O
teaching O
them O
to O
be O
very O
clever. O
. O
. O
. O
No, O
that's O
true O
-- O
a O
nice O
little O
lad, O
no O
harm O
in O
him. O
. O
. O
. O
He'll O
grow O
up O
and O
be O
a O
help O
to O
his O
father. O
. O
. O
. O
You, O
Yegory, O
are O
little O
now, O
but O
you'll O
grow O
big O
and O
will O
keep O
your O
father O
and O
mother. O
. O
. O
. O
So O
it O
is O
ordained O
of O
God, O
'Honour O
your O
father O
and O
your O
mother.' O
. O
. O
. O
I O
had O
children O
myself, O
but O
they O
were O
burnt. O
. O
. O
. O
My O
wife O
was O
burnt O
and O
my O
children, O
. O
. O
. O
that's O
true. O
. O
. O
. O
The O
hut O
caught O
fire O
on O
the O
night O
of O
Epiphany. O
. O
. O
. O
I O
was O
not O
at O
home, O
I O
was O
driving O
in O
Oryol. O
In O
Oryol. O
. O
. O
. O
Marya O
dashed O
out O
into O
the O
street, O
but O
remembering O
that O
the O
children O
were O
asleep O
in O
the O
hut, O
ran O
back O
and O
was O
burnt O
with O
her O
children. O
. O
. O
. O
Next O
day O
they O
found O
nothing O
but O
bones." O
About O
midnight O
Yegorushka O
and O
the O
waggoners O
were O
again O
sitting O
round O
a O
small O
camp O
fire. O
While O
the O
dry O
twigs O
and O
stems O
were O
burning O
up, O
Kiruha O
and O
Vassya O
went O
off O
somewhere O
to O
get O
water O
from O
a O
creek; O
they O
vanished O
into O
the O
darkness, O
but O
could O
be O
heard O
all O
the O
time O
talking O
and O
clinking O
their O
pails; O
so O
the O
creek O
was O
not O
far O
away. O
The O
light O
from O
the O
fire O
lay O
a O
great O
flickering O
patch O
on O
the O
earth; O
though O
the O
moon O
was O
bright, O
yet O
everything O
seemed O
impenetrably O
black O
beyond O
that O
red O
patch. O
The O
light O
was O
in O
the O
waggoners' O
eyes, O
and O
they O
saw O
only O
part O
of O
the O
great O
road; O
almost O
unseen O
in O
the O
darkness O
the O
waggons O
with O
the O
bales O
and O
the O
horses O
looked O
like O
a O
mountain O
of O
undefined O
shape. O
Twenty O
paces O
from O
the O
camp O
fire O
at O
the O
edge O
of O
the O
road O
stood O
a O
wooden O
cross O
that O
had O
fallen O
aslant. O
Before O
the O
camp O
fire O
had O
been O
lighted, O
when O
he O
could O
still O
see O
things O
at O
a O
distance, O
Yegorushka O
had O
noticed O
that O
there O
was O
a O
similar O
old O
slanting O
cross O
on O
the O
other O
side O
of O
the O
great O
road. O
Coming O
back O
with O
the O
water, O
Kiruha O
and O
Vassya O
filled O
the O
cauldron O
and O
fixed O
it O
over O
the O
fire. O
Styopka, O
with O
the O
notched O
spoon O
in O
his O
hand, O
took O
his O
place O
in O
the O
smoke O
by O
the O
cauldron, O
gazing O
dreamily O
into O
the O
water O
for O
the O
scum O
to O
rise. O
Panteley O
and O
Emelyan O
were O
sitting O
side O
by O
side O
in O
silence, O
brooding O
over O
something. O
Dymov O
was O
lying O
on O
his O
stomach, O
with O
his O
head O
propped O
on O
his O
fists, O
looking O
into O
the O
fire. O
. O
. O
. O
Styopka's O
shadow O
was O
dancing O
over O
him, O
so O
that O
his O
handsome O
face O
was O
at O
one O
minute O
covered O
with O
darkness, O
at O
the O
next O
lighted O
up. O
. O
. O
. O
Kiruha O
and O
Vassya O
were O
wandering O
about O
at O
a O
little O
distance O
gathering O
dry O
grass O
and O
bark O
for O
the O
fire. O
Yegorushka, O
with O
his O
hands O
in O
his O
pockets, O
was O
standing O
by O
Panteley, O
watching O
how O
the O
fire O
devoured O
the O
grass. O
All O
were O
resting, O
musing O
on O
something, O
and O
they O
glanced O
cursorily O
at O
the O
cross O
over O
which O
patches O
of O
red O
light O
were O
dancing. O
There O
is O
something O
melancholy, O
pensive, O
and O
extremely O
poetical O
about O
a O
solitary O
tomb; O
one O
feels O
its O
silence, O
and O
the O
silence O
gives O
one O
the O
sense O
of O
the O
presence O
of O
the O
soul O
of O
the O
unknown O
man O
who O
lies O
under O
the O
cross. O
Is O
that O
soul O
at O
peace O
on O
the O
steppe? O
Does O
it O
grieve O
in O
the O
moonlight? O
Near O
the O
tomb O
the O
steppe O
seems O
melancholy, O
dreary O
and O
mournful; O
the O
grass O
seems O
more O
sorrowful, O
and O
one O
fancies O
the O
grasshoppers O
chirrup O
less O
freely, O
and O
there O
is O
no O
passer-by O
who O
would O
not O
remember O
that O
lonely O
soul O
and O
keep O
looking O
back O
at O
the O
tomb, O
till O
it O
was O
left O
far O
behind O
and O
hidden O
in O
the O
mists. O
. O
. O
. O
"Grandfather, O
what O
is O
that O
cross O
for?" O
asked O
Yegorushka. O
Panteley O
looked O
at O
the O
cross O
and O
then O
at O
Dymov O
and O
asked: O
"Nikola, O
isn't O
this O
the O
place O
where O
the O
mowers O
killed O
the O
merchants?" O
Dymov O
not O
very O
readily O
raised O
himself O
on O
his O
elbow, O
looked O
at O
the O
road O
and O
said: O
"Yes, O
it O
is. O
. O
. O
." O
A O
silence O
followed. O
Kiruha O
broke O
up O
some O
dry O
stalks, O
crushed O
them O
up O
together O
and O
thrust O
them O
under O
the O
cauldron. O
The O
fire O
flared O
up O
brightly; O
Styopka O
was O
enveloped O
in O
black O
smoke, O
and O
the O
shadow O
cast O
by O
the O
cross O
danced O
along O
the O
road O
in O
the O
dusk O
beside O
the O
waggons. O
"Yes, O
they O
were O
killed," O
Dymov O
said O
reluctantly. O
"Two O
merchants, O
father O
and O
son, O
were O
travelling, O
selling O
holy O
images. O
They O
put O
up O
in O
the O
inn O
not O
far O
from O
here O
that O
is O
now O
kept O
by O
Ignat O
Fomin. O
The O
old O
man O
had O
a O
drop O
too O
much, O
and O
began O
boasting O
that O
he O
had O
a O
lot O
of O
money O
with O
him. O
We O
all O
know O
merchants O
are O
a O
boastful O
set, O
God O
preserve O
us. O
. O
. O
. O
They O
can't O
resist O
showing O
off O
before O
the O
likes O
of O
us. O
And O
at O
the O
time O
some O
mowers O
were O
staying O
the O
night O
at O
the O
inn. O
So O
they O
overheard O
what O
the O
merchants O
said O
and O
took O
note O
of O
it." O
"O O
Lord! O
. O
. O
. O
Holy O
Mother!" O
sighed O
Panteley. O
"Next O
day, O
as O
soon O
as O
it O
was O
light," O
Dymov O
went O
on, O
"the O
merchants O
were O
preparing O
to O
set O
off O
and O
the O
mowers O
tried O
to O
join O
them. O
'Let O
us O
go O
together, O
your O
worships. O
It O
will O
be O
more O
cheerful O
and O
there O
will O
be O
less O
danger, O
for O
this O
is O
an O
out-of-the-way O
place. O
. O
. O
.' O
The O
merchants O
had O
to O
travel O
at O
a O
walking O
pace O
to O
avoid O
breaking O
the O
images, O
and O
that O
just O
suited O
the O
mowers. O
. O
. O
." O
Dymov O
rose O
into O
a O
kneeling O
position O
and O
stretched. O
"Yes," O
he O
went O
on, O
yawning. O
"Everything O
went O
all O
right O
till O
they O
reached O
this O
spot, O
and O
then O
the O
mowers O
let O
fly O
at O
them O
with O
their O
scythes. O
The O
son, O
he O
was O
a O
fine O
young O
fellow, O
snatched O
the O
scythe O
from O
one O
of O
them, O
and O
he O
used O
it, O
too. O
. O
. O
. O
Well, O
of O
course, O
they O
got O
the O
best O
of O
it O
because O
there O
were O
eight O
of O
them. O
They O
hacked O
at O
the O
merchants O
so O
that O
there O
was O
not O
a O
sound O
place O
left O
on O
their O
bodies; O
when O
they O
had O
finished O
they O
dragged O
both O
of O
them O
off O
the O
road, O
the O
father O
to O
one O
side O
and O
the O
son O
to O
the O
other. O
Opposite O
that O
cross O
there O
is O
another O
cross O
on O
this O
side. O
. O
. O
. O
Whether O
it O
is O
still O
standing, O
I O
don't O
know. O
. O
. O
. O
I O
can't O
see O
from O
here. O
. O
. O
." O
"It O
is," O
said O
Kiruha. O
"They O
say O
they O
did O
not O
find O
much O
money O
afterwards." O
"No," O
Panteley O
confirmed; O
"they O
only O
found O
a O
hundred O
roubles." O
"And O
three O
of O
them O
died O
afterwards, O
for O
the O
merchant O
had O
cut O
them O
badly O
with O
the O
scythe, O
too. O
They O
died O
from O
loss O
of O
blood. O
One O
had O
his O
hand O
cut O
off, O
so O
that O
they O
say O
he O
ran O
three O
miles O
without O
his O
hand, O
and O
they O
found O
him O
on O
a O
mound O
close O
to O
Kurikovo. O
He O
was O
squatting O
on O
his O
heels, O
with O
his O
head O
on O
his O
knees, O
as O
though O
he O
were O
lost O
in O
thought, O
but O
when O
they O
looked O
at O
him O
there O
was O
no O
life O
in O
him O
and O
he O
was O
dead. O
. O
. O
." O
"They O
found O
him O
by O
the O
track O
of O
blood," O
said O
Panteley. O
Everyone O
looked O
at O
the O
cross, O
and O
again O
there O
was O
a O
hush. O
From O
somewhere, O
most O
likely O
from O
the O
creek, O
floated O
the O
mournful O
cry O
of O
the O
bird: O
"Sleep! O
sleep! O
sleep!" O
"There O
are O
a O
great O
many O
wicked O
people O
in O
the O
world," O
said O
Emelyan. O
"A O
great O
many," O
assented O
Panteley, O
and O
he O
moved O
up O
closer O
to O
the O
fire O
as O
though O
he O
were O
frightened. O
"A O
great O
many," O
he O
went O
on O
in O
a O
low O
voice. O
"I've O
seen O
lots O
and O
lots O
of O
them. O
. O
. O
. O
Wicked O
people! O
. O
. O
. O
I O
have O
seen O
a O
great O
many O
holy O
and O
just, O
too. O
. O
. O
. O
Queen O
of O
Heaven, O
save O
us O
and O
have O
mercy O
on O
us. O
I O
remember O
once O
thirty O
years O
ago, O
or O
maybe O
more, O
I O
was O
driving O
a O
merchant O
from O
Morshansk. O
The O
merchant O
was O
a O
jolly O
handsome O
fellow, O
with O
money, O
too O
. O
. O
. O
the O
merchant O
was O
. O
. O
. O
a O
nice O
man, O
no O
harm O
in O
him. O
. O
. O
. O
So O
we O
put O
up O
for O
the O
night O
at O
an O
inn. O
And O
in O
Russia O
the O
inns O
are O
not O
what O
they O
are O
in O
these O
parts. O
There O
the O
yards O
are O
roofed O
in O
and O
look O
like O
the O
ground O
floor, O
or O
let O
us O
say O
like O
barns O
in O
good O
farms. O
Only O
a O
barn O
would O
be O
a O
bit O
higher. O
So O
we O
put O
up O
there O
and O
were O
all O
right. O
My O
merchant O
was O
in O
a O
room, O
while O
I O
was O
with O
the O
horses, O
and O
everything O
was O
as O
it O
should O
be. O
So, O
lads, O
I O
said O
my O
prayers O
before O
going O
to O
sleep O
and O
began O
walking O
about O
the O
yard. O
And O
it O
was O
a O
dark O
night, O
I O
couldn't O
see O
anything; O
it O
was O
no O
good O
trying. O
So O
I O
walked O
about O
a O
bit O
up O
to O
the O
waggons, O
or O
nearly, O
when O
I O
saw O
a O
light O
gleaming. O
What O
could O
it O
mean? O
I O
thought O
the O
people O
of O
the O
inn O
had O
gone O
to O
bed O
long O
ago, O
and O
besides O
the O
merchant O
and O
me O
there O
were O
no O
other O
guests O
in O
the O
inn. O
. O
. O
. O
Where O
could O
the O
light O
have O
come O
from? O
I O
felt O
suspicious. O
. O
. O
. O
I O
went O
closer O
. O
. O
. O
towards O
the O
light. O
. O
. O
. O
The O
Lord O
have O
mercy O
upon O
me! O
and O
save O
me, O
Queen O
of O
Heaven! O
I O
looked O
and O
there O
was O
a O
little O
window O
with O
a O
grating, O
. O
. O
. O
close O
to O
the O
ground, O
in O
the O
house. O
. O
. O
I O
lay O
down O
on O
the O
ground O
and O
looked O
in; O
as O
soon O
as O
I O
looked O
in O
a O
cold O
chill O
ran O
all O
down O
me. O
. O
. O
." O
Kiruha, O
trying O
not O
to O
make O
a O
noise, O
thrust O
a O
handful O
of O
twigs O
into O
the O
fire. O
After O
waiting O
for O
it O
to O
leave O
off O
crackling O
and O
hissing, O
the O
old O
man O
went O
on: O
"I O
looked O
in O
and O
there O
was O
a O
big O
cellar, O
black O
and O
dark. O
. O
. O
. O
There O
was O
a O
lighted O
lantern O
on O
a O
tub. O
In O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
cellar O
were O
about O
a O
dozen O
men O
in O
red O
shirts O
with O
their O
sleeves O
turned O
up, O
sharpening O
long O
knives. O
. O
. O
. O
Ugh! O
So O
we O
had O
fallen O
into O
a O
nest O
of O
robbers. O
. O
. O
. O
What's O
to O
be O
done? O
I O
ran O
to O
the O
merchant, O
waked O
him O
up O
quietly, O
and O
said: O
'Don't O
be O
frightened, O
merchant,' O
said O
I, O
'but O
we O
are O
in O
a O
bad O
way. O
We O
have O
fallen O
into O
a O
nest O
of O
robbers,' O
I O
said. O
He O
turned O
pale O
and O
asked: O
'What O
are O
we O
to O
do O
now, O
Panteley? O
I O
have O
a O
lot O
of O
money O
that O
belongs O
to O
orphans. O
As O
for O
my O
life,' O
he O
said, O
'that's O
in O
God's O
hands. O
I O
am O
not O
afraid O
to O
die, O
but O
it's O
dreadful O
to O
lose O
the O
orphans' O
money,' O
said O
he. O
. O
. O
. O
What O
were O
we O
to O
do? O
The O
gates O
were O
locked; O
there O
was O
no O
getting O
out. O
If O
there O
had O
been O
a O
fence O
one O
could O
have O
climbed O
over O
it, O
but O
with O
the O
yard O
shut O
up! O
. O
. O
. O
'Come, O
don't O
be O
frightened, O
merchant,' O
said O
I; O
'but O
pray O
to O
God. O
Maybe O
the O
Lord O
will O
not O
let O
the O
orphans O
suffer. O
Stay O
still.' O
said O
I, O
'and O
make O
no O
sign, O
and O
meanwhile, O
maybe, O
I O
shall O
think O
of O
something. O
. O
. O
.' O
Right! O
. O
. O
. O
I O
prayed O
to O
God O
and O
the O
Lord O
put O
the O
thought O
into O
my O
mind. O
. O
. O
. O
I O
clambered O
up O
on O
my O
chaise O
and O
softly, O
. O
. O
. O
softly O
so O
that O
no O
one O
should O
hear, O
began O
pulling O
out O
the O
straw O
in O
the O
thatch, O
made O
a O
hole O
and O
crept O
out, O
crept O
out. O
. O
. O
. O
Then O
I O
jumped O
off O
the O
roof O
and O
ran O
along O
the O
road O
as O
fast O
as O
I O
could. O
I O
ran O
and O
ran O
till O
I O
was O
nearly O
dead. O
. O
. O
. O
I O
ran O
maybe O
four O
miles O
without O
taking O
breath, O
if O
not O
more. O
Thank O
God O
I O
saw O
a O
village. O
I O
ran O
up O
to O
a O
hut O
and O
began O
tapping O
at O
a O
window. O
'Good O
Christian O
people,' O
I O
said, O
and O
told O
them O
all O
about O
it, O
'do O
not O
let O
a O
Christian O
soul O
perish. O
. O
. O
.' O
I O
waked O
them O
all O
up. O
. O
. O
. O
The O
peasants O
gathered O
together O
and O
went O
with O
me, O
. O
. O
one O
with O
a O
cord, O
one O
with O
an O
oakstick, O
others O
with O
pitchforks. O
. O
. O
. O
We O
broke O
in O
the O
gates O
of O
the O
inn-yard O
and O
went O
straight O
to O
the O
cellar. O
. O
. O
. O
And O
the O
robbers O
had O
just O
finished O
sharpening O
their O
knives O
and O
were O
going O
to O
kill O
the O
merchant. O
The O
peasants O
took O
them, O
every O
one O
of O
them, O
bound O
them O
and O
carried O
them O
to O
the O
police. O
The O
merchant O
gave O
them O
three O
hundred O
roubles O
in O
his O
joy, O
and O
gave O
me O
five O
gold O
pieces O
and O
put O
my O
name O
down. O
They O
said O
that O
they O
found O
human O
bones O
in O
the O
cellar O
afterwards, O
heaps O
and O
heaps O
of O
them. O
. O
. O
. O
Bones! O
. O
. O
. O
So O
they O
robbed O
people O
and O
then O
buried O
them, O
so O
that O
there O
should O
be O
no O
traces. O
. O
. O
. O
Well, O
afterwards O
they O
were O
punished O
at O
Morshansk." O
Panteley O
had O
finished O
his O
story, O
and O
he O
looked O
round O
at O
his O
listeners. O
They O
were O
gazing O
at O
him O
in O
silence. O
The O
water O
was O
boiling O
by O
now O
and O
Styopka O
was O
skimming O
off O
the O
froth. O
"Is O
the O
fat O
ready?" O
Kiruha O
asked O
him O
in O
a O
whisper. O
"Wait O
a O
little. O
. O
. O
. O
Directly." O
Styopka, O
his O
eyes O
fixed O
on O
Panteley O
as O
though O
he O
were O
afraid O
that O
the O
latter O
might O
begin O
some O
story O
before O
he O
was O
back, O
ran O
to O
the O
waggons; O
soon O
he O
came O
back O
with O
a O
little O
wooden O
bowl O
and O
began O
pounding O
some O
lard O
in O
it. O
"I O
went O
another O
journey O
with O
a O
merchant, O
too, O
. O
. O
." O
Panteley O
went O
on O
again, O
speaking O
as O
before O
in O
a O
low O
voice O
and O
with O
fixed O
unblinking O
eyes. O
"His O
name, O
as O
I O
remember O
now, O
was O
Pyotr O
Grigoritch. O
He O
was O
a O
nice O
man, O
. O
. O
. O
the O
merchant O
was. O
We O
stopped O
in O
the O
same O
way O
at O
an O
inn. O
. O
. O
. O
He O
indoors O
and O
me O
with O
the O
horses. O
. O
. O
. O
The O
people O
of O
the O
house, O
the O
innkeeper O
and O
his O
wife, O
seemed O
friendly O
good O
sort O
of O
people; O
the O
labourers, O
too, O
seemed O
all O
right; O
but O
yet, O
lads, O
I O
couldn't O
sleep. O
I O
had O
a O
queer O
feeling O
in O
my O
heart, O
. O
. O
. O
a O
queer O
feeling, O
that O
was O
just O
it. O
The O
gates O
were O
open O
and O
there O
were O
plenty O
of O
people O
about, O
and O
yet O
I O
felt O
afraid O
and O
not O
myself. O
Everyone O
had O
been O
asleep O
long O
ago. O
It O
was O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
night; O
it O
would O
soon O
be O
time O
to O
get O
up, O
and O
I O
was O
lying O
alone O
in O
my O
chaise O
and O
could O
not O
close O
my O
eyes, O
as O
though O
I O
were O
some O
owl. O
And O
then, O
lads, O
I O
heard O
this O
sound, O
'Toop! O
toop! O
toop!' O
Someone O
was O
creeping O
up O
to O
the O
chaise. O
I O
poke O
my O
head O
out, O
and O
there O
was O
a O
peasant O
woman O
in O
nothing O
but O
her O
shift O
and O
with O
her O
feet O
bare. O
. O
. O
. O
'What O
do O
you O
want, O
good O
woman?' O
I O
asked. O
And O
she O
was O
all O
of O
a O
tremble; O
her O
face O
was O
terror-stricken. O
. O
. O
'Get O
up, O
good O
man,' O
said O
she; O
'the O
people O
are O
plotting O
evil. O
. O
. O
. O
They O
mean O
to O
kill O
your O
merchant. O
With O
my O
own O
ears O
I O
heard O
the O
master O
whispering O
with O
his O
wife. O
. O
. O
.' O
So O
it O
was O
not O
for O
nothing, O
the O
foreboding O
of O
my O
heart! O
'And O
who O
are O
you?' O
I O
asked. O
'I O
am O
their O
cook,' O
she O
said. O
. O
. O
. O
Right! O
. O
. O
. O
So O
I O
got O
out O
of O
the O
chaise O
and O
went O
to O
the O
merchant. O
I O
waked O
him O
up O
and O
said: O
'Things O
aren't O
quite O
right, O
Pyotr O
Grigoritch. O
. O
. O
. O
Make O
haste O
and O
rouse O
yourself O
from O
sleep, O
your O
worship, O
and O
dress O
now O
while O
there O
is O
still O
time,' O
I O
said; O
'and O
to O
save O
our O
skins, O
let O
us O
get O
away O
from O
trouble.' O
He O
had O
no O
sooner O
begun O
dressing O
when O
the O
door O
opened O
and, O
mercy O
on O
us! O
I O
saw, O
Holy O
Mother! O
the O
innkeeper O
and O
his O
wife O
come O
into O
the O
room O
with O
three O
labourers. O
. O
. O
. O
So O
they O
had O
persuaded O
the O
labourers O
to O
join O
them. O
'The O
merchant O
has O
a O
lot O
of O
money, O
and O
we'll O
go O
shares,' O
they O
told O
them. O
Every O
one O
of O
the O
five O
had O
a O
long O
knife O
in O
their O
hand O
each O
a O
knife. O
The O
innkeeper O
locked O
the O
door O
and O
said: O
'Say O
your O
prayers, O
travellers, O
. O
. O
. O
and O
if O
you O
begin O
screaming,' O
they O
said, O
'we O
won't O
let O
you O
say O
your O
prayers O
before O
you O
die. O
. O
. O
.' O
As O
though O
we O
could O
scream! O
I O
had O
such O
a O
lump O
in O
my O
throat O
I O
could O
not O
cry O
out. O
. O
. O
. O
The O
merchant O
wept O
and O
said: O
'Good O
Christian O
people! O
you O
have O
resolved O
to O
kill O
me O
because O
my O
money O
tempts O
you. O
Well, O
so O
be O
it; O
I O
shall O
not O
be O
the O
first O
nor O
shall O
I O
be O
the O
last. O
Many O
of O
us O
merchants O
have O
been O
murdered O
at O
inns. O
But O
why, O
good O
Christian O
brothers,' O
says O
he, O
'murder O
my O
driver? O
Why O
should O
he O
have O
to O
suffer O
for O
my O
money?' O
And O
he O
said O
that O
so O
pitifully! O
And O
the O
innkeeper O
answered O
him: O
'If O
we O
leave O
him O
alive,' O
said O
he, O
'he O
will O
be O
the O
first O
to O
bear O
witness O
against O
us. O
One O
may O
just O
as O
well O
kill O
two O
as O
one. O
You O
can O
but O
answer O
once O
for O
seven O
misdeeds. O
. O
. O
Say O
your O
prayers, O
that's O
all O
you O
can O
do, O
and O
it O
is O
no O
good O
talking!' O
The O
merchant O
and O
I O
knelt O
down O
side O
by O
side O
and O
wept O
and O
said O
our O
prayers. O
He O
thought O
of O
his O
children. O
I O
was O
young O
in O
those O
days; O
I O
wanted O
to O
live. O
. O
. O
. O
We O
looked O
at O
the O
images O
and O
prayed, O
and O
so O
pitifully O
that O
it O
brings O
a O
tear O
even O
now. O
. O
. O
. O
And O
the O
innkeeper's O
wife O
looks O
at O
us O
and O
says: O
'Good O
people,' O
said O
she, O
'don't O
bear O
a O
grudge O
against O
us O
in O
the O
other O
world O
and O
pray O
to O
God O
for O
our O
punishment, O
for O
it O
is O
want O
that O
drives O
us O
to O
it.' O
We O
prayed O
and O
wept O
and O
prayed O
and O
wept, O
and O
God O
heard O
us. O
He O
had O
pity O
on O
us, O
I O
suppose. O
. O
. O
. O
At O
the O
very O
minute O
when O
the O
innkeeper O
had O
taken O
the O
merchant O
by O
the O
beard O
to O
rip O
open O
his O
throat O
with O
his O
knife O
suddenly O
someone O
seemed O
to O
tap O
at O
the O
window O
from O
the O
yard! O
We O
all O
started, O
and O
the O
innkeeper's O
hands O
dropped. O
. O
. O
. O
Someone O
was O
tapping O
at O
the O
window O
and O
shouting: O
'Pyotr O
Grigoritch,' O
he O
shouted, O
'are O
you O
here? O
Get O
ready O
and O
let's O
go!' O
The O
people O
saw O
that O
someone O
had O
come O
for O
the O
merchant; O
they O
were O
terrified O
and O
took O
to O
their O
heels. O
. O
. O
. O
And O
we O
made O
haste O
into O
the O
yard, O
harnessed O
the O
horses, O
and O
were O
out O
of O
sight O
in O
a O
minute. O
. O
." O
"Who O
was O
it O
knocked O
at O
the O
window?" O
asked O
Dymov. O
"At O
the O
window? O
It O
must O
have O
been O
a O
holy O
saint O
or O
angel, O
for O
there O
was O
no O
one O
else. O
. O
. O
. O
When O
we O
drove O
out O
of O
the O
yard O
there O
wasn't O
a O
soul O
in O
the O
street. O
. O
. O
. O
It O
was O
the O
Lord's O
doing." O
Panteley O
told O
other O
stories, O
and O
in O
all O
of O
them O
"long O
knives" O
figured O
and O
all O
alike O
sounded O
made O
up. O
Had O
he O
heard O
these O
stories O
from O
someone O
else, O
or O
had O
he O
made O
them O
up O
himself O
in O
the O
remote O
past, O
and O
afterwards, O
as O
his O
memory O
grew O
weaker, O
mixed O
up O
his O
experiences O
with O
his O
imaginations O
and O
become O
unable O
to O
distinguish O
one O
from O
the O
other? O
Anything O
is O
possible, O
but O
it O
is O
strange O
that O
on O
this O
occasion O
and O
for O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
journey, O
whenever O
he O
happened O
to O
tell O
a O
story, O
he O
gave O
unmistakable O
preference O
to O
fiction, O
and O
never O
told O
of O
what O
he O
really O
had O
experienced. O
At O
the O
time O
Yegorushka O
took O
it O
all O
for O
the O
genuine O
thing, O
and O
believed O
every O
word; O
later O
on O
it O
seemed O
to O
him O
strange O
that O
a O
man O
who O
in O
his O
day O
had O
travelled O
all O
over O
Russia O
and O
seen O
and O
known O
so O
much, O
whose O
wife O
and O
children O
had O
been O
burnt O
to O
death, O
so O
failed O
to O
appreciate O
the O
wealth O
of O
his O
life O
that O
whenever O
he O
was O
sitting O
by O
the O
camp O
fire O
he O
was O
either O
silent O
or O
talked O
of O
what O
had O
never O
been. O
Over O
their O
porridge O
they O
were O
all O
silent, O
thinking O
of O
what O
they O
had O
just O
heard. O
Life O
is O
terrible O
and O
marvellous, O
and O
so, O
however O
terrible O
a O
story O
you O
tell O
in O
Russia, O
however O
you O
embroider O
it O
with O
nests O
of O
robbers, O
long O
knives O
and O
such O
marvels, O
it O
always O
finds O
an O
echo O
of O
reality O
in O
the O
soul O
of O
the O
listener, O
and O
only O
a O
man O
who O
has O
been O
a O
good O
deal O
affected O
by O
education O
looks O
askance O
distrustfully, O
and O
even O
he O
will O
be O
silent. O
The O
cross O
by O
the O
roadside, O
the O
dark O
bales O
of O
wool, O
the O
wide O
expanse O
of O
the O
plain, O
and O
the O
lot O
of O
the O
men O
gathered O
together O
by O
the O
camp O
fire-- O
all O
this O
was O
of O
itself O
so O
marvellous O
and O
terrible O
that O
the O
fantastic O
colours O
of O
legend O
and O
fairy-tale O
were O
pale O
and O
blended O
with O
life. O
All O
the O
others O
ate O
out O
of O
the O
cauldron, O
but O
Panteley O
sat O
apart O
and O
ate O
his O
porridge O
out O
of O
a O
wooden O
bowl. O
His O
spoon O
was O
not O
like O
those O
the O
others O
had, O
but O
was O
made O
of O
cypress O
wood, O
with O
a O
little O
cross O
on O
it. O
Yegorushka, O
looking O
at O
him, O
thought O
of O
the O
little O
ikon O
glass O
and O
asked O
Styopka O
softly: O
"Why O
does O
Grandfather O
sit O
apart?" O
"He O
is O
an O
Old O
Believer," O
Styopka O
and O
Vassya O
answered O
in O
a O
whisper. O
And O
as O
they O
said O
it O
they O
looked O
as O
though O
they O
were O
speaking O
of O
some O
secret O
vice O
or O
weakness. O
All O
sat O
silent, O
thinking. O
After O
the O
terrible O
stories O
there O
was O
no O
inclination O
to O
speak O
of O
ordinary O
things. O
All O
at O
once O
in O
the O
midst O
of O
the O
silence O
Vassya O
drew O
himself O
up O
and, O
fixing O
his O
lustreless O
eyes O
on O
one O
point, O
pricked O
up O
his O
ears. O
"What O
is O
it?" O
Dymov O
asked O
him. O
"Someone O
is O
coming," O
answered O
Vassya. O
"Where O
do O
you O
see O
him?" O
"Yo-on-der! O
There's O
something O
white. O
. O
." O
There O
was O
nothing O
to O
be O
seen O
but O
darkness O
in O
the O
direction O
in O
which O
Vassya O
was O
looking; O
everyone O
listened, O
but O
they O
could O
hear O
no O
sound O
of O
steps. O
"Is O
he O
coming O
by O
the O
highroad?" O
asked O
Dymov. O
"No, O
over O
the O
open O
country. O
. O
. O
. O
He O
is O
coming O
this O
way." O
A O
minute O
passed O
in O
silence. O
"And O
maybe O
it's O
the O
merchant O
who O
was O
buried O
here O
walking O
over O
the O
steppe," O
said O
Dymov. O
All O
looked O
askance O
at O
the O
cross, O
exchanged O
glances O
and O
suddenly O
broke O
into O
a O
laugh. O
They O
felt O
ashamed O
of O
their O
terror. O
"Why O
should O
he O
walk?" O
asked O
Panteley. O
"It's O
only O
those O
walk O
at O
night O
whom O
the O
earth O
will O
not O
take O
to O
herself. O
And O
the O
merchants O
were O
all O
right. O
. O
. O
. O
The O
merchants O
have O
received O
the O
crown O
of O
martyrs." O
But O
all O
at O
once O
they O
heard O
the O
sound O
of O
steps; O
someone O
was O
coming O
in O
haste. O
"He's O
carrying O
something," O
said O
Vassya. O
They O
could O
hear O
the O
grass O
rustling O
and O
the O
dry O
twigs O
crackling O
under O
the O
feet O
of O
the O
approaching O
wayfarer. O
But O
from O
the O
glare O
of O
the O
camp O
fire O
nothing O
could O
be O
seen. O
At O
last O
the O
steps O
sounded O
close O
by, O
and O
someone O
coughed. O
The O
flickering O
light O
seemed O
to O
part; O
a O
veil O
dropped O
from O
the O
waggoners' O
eyes, O
and O
they O
saw O
a O
man O
facing O
them. O
Whether O
it O
was O
due O
to O
the O
flickering O
light O
or O
because O
everyone O
wanted O
to O
make O
out O
the O
man's O
face O
first O
of O
all, O
it O
happened, O
strangely O
enough, O
that O
at O
the O
first O
glance O
at O
him O
they O
all O
saw, O
first O
of O
all, O
not O
his O
face O
nor O
his O
clothes, O
but O
his O
smile. O
It O
was O
an O
extraordinarily O
good-natured, O
broad, O
soft O
smile, O
like O
that O
of O
a O
baby O
on O
waking, O
one O
of O
those O
infectious O
smiles O
to O
which O
it O
is O
difficult O
not O
to O
respond O
by O
smiling O
too. O
The O
stranger, O
when O
they O
did O
get O
a O
good O
look O
at O
him, O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
a O
man O
of O
thirty, O
ugly O
and O
in O
no O
way O
remarkable. O
He O
was O
a O
tall O
Little O
Russian, O
with O
a O
long O
nose, O
long O
arms O
and O
long O
legs; O
everything O
about O
him O
seemed O
long O
except O
his O
neck, O
which O
was O
so O
short O
that O
it O
made O
him O
seem O
stooping. O
He O
was O
wearing O
a O
clean O
white O
shirt O
with O
an O
embroidered O
collar, O
white O
trousers, O
and O
new O
high O
boots, O
and O
in O
comparison O
with O
the O
waggoners O
he O
looked O
quite O
a O
dandy. O
In O
his O
arms O
he O
was O
carrying O
something O
big, O
white, O
and O
at O
the O
first O
glance O
strange-looking, O
and O
the O
stock O
of O
a O
gun O
also O
peeped O
out O
from O
behind O
his O
shoulder. O
Coming O
from O
the O
darkness O
into O
the O
circle O
of O
light, O
he O
stopped O
short O
as O
though O
petrified, O
and O
for O
half O
a O
minute O
looked O
at O
the O
waggoners O
as O
though O
he O
would O
have O
said: O
"Just O
look O
what O
a O
smile O
I O
have!" O
Then O
he O
took O
a O
step O
towards O
the O
fire, O
smiled O
still O
more O
radiantly O
and O
said: O
"Bread O
and O
salt, O
friends!" O
"You O
are O
very O
welcome!" O
Panteley O
answered O
for O
them O
all. O
The O
stranger O
put O
down O
by O
the O
fire O
what O
he O
was O
carrying O
in O
his O
arms O
--it O
was O
a O
dead O
bustard-- O
and O
greeted O
them O
once O
more. O
They O
all O
went O
up O
to O
the O
bustard O
and O
began O
examining O
it. O
"A O
fine O
big O
bird; O
what O
did O
you O
kill O
it O
with?" O
asked O
Dymov. O
"Grape-shot. O
You O
can't O
get O
him O
with O
small O
shot, O
he O
won't O
let O
you O
get O
near O
enough. O
Buy O
it, O
friends! O
I O
will O
let O
you O
have O
it O
for O
twenty O
kopecks." O
"What O
use O
would O
it O
be O
to O
us? O
It's O
good O
roast, O
but O
I O
bet O
it O
would O
be O
tough O
boiled; O
you O
could O
not O
get O
your O
teeth O
into O
it. O
. O
. O
." O
"Oh, O
what O
a O
pity! O
I O
would O
take O
it O
to O
the O
gentry O
at O
the O
farm; O
they O
would O
give O
me O
half O
a O
rouble O
for O
it. O
But O
it's O
a O
long O
way O
to O
go-- O
twelve O
miles!" O
The O
stranger O
sat O
down, O
took O
off O
his O
gun O
and O
laid O
it O
beside O
him. O
He O
seemed O
sleepy O
and O
languid; O
he O
sat O
smiling, O
and, O
screwing O
up O
his O
eyes O
at O
the O
firelight, O
apparently O
thinking O
of O
something O
very O
agreeable. O
They O
gave O
him O
a O
spoon; O
he O
began O
eating. O
"Who O
are O
you?" O
Dymov O
asked O
him. O
The O
stranger O
did O
not O
hear O
the O
question; O
he O
made O
no O
answer, O
and O
did O
not O
even O
glance O
at O
Dymov. O
Most O
likely O
this O
smiling O
man O
did O
not O
taste O
the O
flavour O
of O
the O
porridge O
either, O
for O
he O
seemed O
to O
eat O
it O
mechanically, O
lifting O
the O
spoon O
to O
his O
lips O
sometimes O
very O
full O
and O
sometimes O
quite O
empty. O
He O
was O
not O
drunk, O
but O
he O
seemed O
to O
have O
something O
nonsensical O
in O
his O
head. O
"I O
ask O
you O
who O
you O
are?" O
repeated O
Dymov. O
"I?" O
said O
the O
unknown, O
starting. O
"Konstantin O
Zvonik O
from O
Rovno. O
It's O
three O
miles O
from O
here." O
And O
anxious O
to O
show O
straight O
off O
that O
he O
was O
not O
quite O
an O
ordinary O
peasant, O
but O
something O
better, O
Konstantin O
hastened O
to O
add: O
"We O
keep O
bees O
and O
fatten O
pigs." O
"Do O
you O
live O
with O
your O
father O
or O
in O
a O
house O
of O
your O
own?" O
"No; O
now O
I O
am O
living O
in O
a O
house O
of O
my O
own. O
I O
have O
parted. O
This O
month, O
just O
after O
St. O
Peter's O
Day, O
I O
got O
married. O
I O
am O
a O
married O
man O
now! O
. O
. O
. O
It's O
eighteen O
days O
since O
the O
wedding." O
"That's O
a O
good O
thing," O
said O
Panteley. O
"Marriage O
is O
a O
good O
thing O
. O
. O
. O
. O
God's O
blessing O
is O
on O
it." O
"His O
young O
wife O
sits O
at O
home O
while O
he O
rambles O
about O
the O
steppe," O
laughed O
Kiruha. O
"Queer O
chap!" O
As O
though O
he O
had O
been O
pinched O
on O
the O
tenderest O
spot, O
Konstantin O
started, O
laughed O
and O
flushed O
crimson. O
"But, O
Lord, O
she O
is O
not O
at O
home!" O
he O
said O
quickly, O
taking O
the O
spoon O
out O
of O
his O
mouth O
and O
looking O
round O
at O
everyone O
with O
an O
expression O
of O
delight O
and O
wonder. O
"She O
is O
not; O
she O
has O
gone O
to O
her O
mother's O
for O
three O
days! O
Yes, O
indeed, O
she O
has O
gone O
away, O
and O
I O
feel O
as O
though O
I O
were O
not O
married. O
. O
. O
." O
Konstantin O
waved O
his O
hand O
and O
turned O
his O
head; O
he O
wanted O
to O
go O
on O
thinking, O
but O
the O
joy O
which O
beamed O
in O
his O
face O
prevented O
him. O
As O
though O
he O
were O
not O
comfortable, O
he O
changed O
his O
attitude, O
laughed, O
and O
again O
waved O
his O
hand. O
He O
was O
ashamed O
to O
share O
his O
happy O
thoughts O
with O
strangers, O
but O
at O
the O
same O
time O
he O
had O
an O
irresistible O
longing O
to O
communicate O
his O
joy. O
"She O
has O
gone O
to O
Demidovo O
to O
see O
her O
mother," O
he O
said, O
blushing O
and O
moving O
his O
gun. O
"She'll O
be O
back O
to-morrow. O
. O
. O
. O
She O
said O
she O
would O
be O
back O
to O
dinner." O
"And O
do O
you O
miss O
her?" O
said O
Dymov. O
"Oh, O
Lord, O
yes; O
I O
should O
think O
so. O
We O
have O
only O
been O
married O
such O
a O
little O
while, O
and O
she O
has O
gone O
away. O
. O
. O
. O
Eh! O
Oh, O
but O
she O
is O
a O
tricky O
one, O
God O
strike O
me O
dead! O
She O
is O
such O
a O
fine, O
splendid O
girl, O
such O
a O
one O
for O
laughing O
and O
singing, O
full O
of O
life O
and O
fire! O
When O
she O
is O
there O
your O
brain O
is O
in O
a O
whirl, O
and O
now O
she O
is O
away O
I O
wander O
about O
the O
steppe O
like O
a O
fool, O
as O
though O
I O
had O
lost O
something. O
I O
have O
been O
walking O
since O
dinner." O
Konstantin O
rubbed O
his O
eyes, O
looked O
at O
the O
fire O
and O
laughed. O
"You O
love O
her, O
then, O
. O
. O
." O
said O
Panteley. O
"She O
is O
so O
fine O
and O
splendid," O
Konstantin O
repeated, O
not O
hearing O
him; O
"such O
a O
housewife, O
clever O
and O
sensible. O
You O
wouldn't O
find O
another O
like O
her O
among O
simple O
folk O
in O
the O
whole O
province. O
She O
has O
gone O
away. O
. O
. O
. O
But O
she O
is O
missing O
me, O
I O
kno-ow! O
I O
know O
the O
little O
magpie. O
She O
said O
she O
would O
be O
back O
to-morrow O
by O
dinner-time. O
. O
. O
. O
And O
just O
think O
how O
queer!" O
Konstantin O
almost O
shouted, O
speaking O
a O
note O
higher O
and O
shifting O
his O
position. O
"Now O
she O
loves O
me O
and O
is O
sad O
without O
me, O
and O
yet O
she O
would O
not O
marry O
me." O
"But O
eat," O
said O
Kiruha. O
"She O
would O
not O
marry O
me," O
Konstantin O
went O
on, O
not O
heeding O
him. O
"I O
have O
been O
struggling O
with O
her O
for O
three O
years! O
I O
saw O
her O
at O
the O
Kalatchik O
fair; O
I O
fell O
madly O
in O
love O
with O
her, O
was O
ready O
to O
hang O
myself. O
. O
. O
. O
I O
live O
at O
Rovno, O
she O
at O
Demidovo, O
more O
than O
twenty O
miles O
apart, O
and O
there O
was O
nothing O
I O
could O
do. O
I O
sent O
match-makers O
to O
her, O
and O
all O
she O
said O
was: O
'I O
won't!' O
Ah, O
the O
magpie! O
I O
sent O
her O
one O
thing O
and O
another, O
earrings O
and O
cakes, O
and O
twenty O
pounds O
of O
honey-- O
but O
still O
she O
said: O
'I O
won't!' O
And O
there O
it O
was. O
If O
you O
come O
to O
think O
of O
it, O
I O
was O
not O
a O
match O
for O
her! O
She O
was O
young O
and O
lovely, O
full O
of O
fire, O
while O
I O
am O
old: O
I O
shall O
soon O
be O
thirty, O
and O
a O
regular O
beauty, O
too; O
a O
fine O
beard O
like O
a O
goat's, O
a O
clear O
complexion O
all O
covered O
with O
pimples-- O
how O
could O
I O
be O
compared O
with O
her! O
The O
only O
thing O
to O
be O
said O
is O
that O
we O
are O
well O
off, O
but O
then O
the O
Vahramenkys O
are O
well O
off, O
too. O
They've O
six O
oxen, O
and O
they O
keep O
a O
couple O
of O
labourers. O
I O
was O
in O
love, O
friends, O
as O
though O
I O
were O
plague-stricken. O
I O
couldn't O
sleep O
or O
eat; O
my O
brain O
was O
full O
of O
thoughts, O
and O
in O
such O
a O
maze, O
Lord O
preserve O
us! O
I O
longed O
to O
see O
her, O
and O
she O
was O
in O
Demidovo. O
What O
do O
you O
think? O
God O
be O
my O
witness, O
I O
am O
not O
lying, O
three O
times O
a O
week O
I O
walked O
over O
there O
on O
foot O
just O
to O
have O
a O
look O
at O
her. O
I O
gave O
up O
my O
work! O
I O
was O
so O
frantic O
that O
I O
even O
wanted O
to O
get O
taken O
on O
as O
a O
labourer O
in O
Demidovo, O
so O
as O
to O
be O
near O
her. O
I O
was O
in O
misery! O
My O
mother O
called O
in O
a O
witch O
a O
dozen O
times; O
my O
father O
tried O
thrashing O
me. O
For O
three O
years O
I O
was O
in O
this O
torment, O
and O
then O
I O
made O
up O
my O
mind. O
'Damn O
my O
soul!' O
I O
said. O
'I O
will O
go O
to O
the O
town O
and O
be O
a O
cabman. O
. O
. O
. O
It O
seems O
it O
is O
fated O
not O
to O
be.' O
At O
Easter O
I O
went O
to O
Demidovo O
to O
have O
a O
last O
look O
at O
her. O
. O
. O
." O
Konstantin O
threw O
back O
his O
head O
and O
went O
off O
into O
a O
mirthful O
tinkling O
laugh, O
as O
though O
he O
had O
just O
taken O
someone O
in O
very O
cleverly. O
"I O
saw O
her O
by O
the O
river O
with O
the O
lads," O
he O
went O
on. O
"I O
was O
overcome O
with O
anger. O
. O
. O
. O
I O
called O
her O
aside O
and O
maybe O
for O
a O
full O
hour O
I O
said O
all O
manner O
of O
things O
to O
her. O
She O
fell O
in O
love O
with O
me! O
For O
three O
years O
she O
did O
not O
like O
me! O
she O
fell O
in O
love O
with O
me O
for O
what O
I O
said O
to O
her. O
. O
. O
." O
"What O
did O
you O
say O
to O
her?" O
asked O
Dymov. O
"What O
did O
I O
say? O
I O
don't O
remember. O
. O
. O
How O
could O
one O
remember? O
My O
words O
flowed O
at O
the O
time O
like O
water O
from O
a O
tap, O
without O
stopping O
to O
take O
breath. O
Ta-ta-ta! O
And O
now O
I O
can't O
utter O
a O
word. O
. O
. O
. O
Well, O
so O
she O
married O
me. O
. O
. O
. O
She's O
gone O
now O
to O
her O
mother's, O
the O
magpie, O
and O
while O
she O
is O
away O
here O
I O
wander O
over O
the O
steppe. O
I O
can't O
stay O
at O
home. O
It's O
more O
than O
I O
can O
do!" O
Konstantin O
awkwardly O
released O
his O
feet, O
on O
which O
he O
was O
sitting, O
stretched O
himself O
on O
the O
earth, O
and O
propped O
his O
head O
in O
his O
fists, O
then O
got O
up O
and O
sat O
down O
again. O
Everyone O
by O
now O
thoroughly O
understood O
that O
he O
was O
in O
love O
and O
happy, O
poignantly O
happy; O
his O
smile, O
his O
eyes, O
and O
every O
movement, O
expressed O
fervent O
happiness. O
He O
could O
not O
find O
a O
place O
for O
himself, O
and O
did O
not O
know O
what O
attitude O
to O
take O
to O
keep O
himself O
from O
being O
overwhelmed O
by O
the O
multitude O
of O
his O
delightful O
thoughts. O
Having O
poured O
out O
his O
soul O
before O
these O
strangers, O
he O
settled O
down O
quietly O
at O
last, O
and, O
looking O
at O
the O
fire, O
sank O
into O
thought. O
At O
the O
sight O
of O
this O
happy O
man O
everyone O
felt O
depressed O
and O
longed O
to O
be O
happy, O
too. O
Everyone O
was O
dreamy. O
Dymov O
got O
up, O
walked O
about O
softly O
by O
the O
fire, O
and O
from O
his O
walk, O
from O
the O
movement O
of O
his O
shoulder-blades, O
it O
could O
be O
seen O
that O
he O
was O
weighed O
down O
by O
depression O
and O
yearning. O
He O
stood O
still O
for O
a O
moment, O
looked O
at O
Konstantin O
and O
sat O
down. O
The O
camp O
fire O
had O
died O
down O
by O
now; O
there O
was O
no O
flicker, O
and O
the O
patch O
of O
red O
had O
grown O
small O
and O
dim. O
. O
. O
. O
And O
as O
the O
fire O
went O
out O
the O
moonlight O
grew O
clearer O
and O
clearer. O
Now O
they O
could O
see O
the O
full O
width O
of O
the O
road, O
the O
bales O
of O
wool, O
the O
shafts O
of O
the O
waggons, O
the O
munching O
horses; O
on O
the O
further O
side O
of O
the O
road O
there O
was O
the O
dim O
outline O
of O
the O
second O
cross. O
. O
. O
. O
Dymov O
leaned O
his O
cheek O
on O
his O
hand O
and O
softly O
hummed O
some O
plaintive O
song. O
Konstantin O
smiled O
drowsily O
and O
chimed O
in O
with O
a O
thin O
voice. O
They O
sang O
for O
half O
a O
minute, O
then O
sank O
into O
silence. O
Emelyan O
started, O
jerked O
his O
elbows O
and O
wriggled O
his O
fingers. O
"Lads," O
he O
said O
in O
an O
imploring O
voice, O
"let's O
sing O
something O
sacred!" O
Tears O
came O
into O
his O
eyes. O
"Lads," O
he O
repeated, O
pressing O
his O
hands O
on O
his O
heart, O
"let's O
sing O
something O
sacred!" O
"I O
don't O
know O
anything," O
said O
Konstantin. O
Everyone O
refused, O
then O
Emelyan O
sang O
alone. O
He O
waved O
both O
arms, O
nodded O
his O
head, O
opened O
his O
mouth, O
but O
nothing O
came O
from O
his O
throat O
but O
a O
discordant O
gasp. O
He O
sang O
with O
his O
arms, O
with O
his O
head, O
with O
his O
eyes, O
even O
with O
the O
swelling O
on O
his O
face; O
he O
sang O
passionately O
with O
anguish, O
and O
the O
more O
he O
strained O
his O
chest O
to O
extract O
at O
least O
one O
note O
from O
it, O
the O
more O
discordant O
were O
his O
gasps. O
Yegorushka, O
like O
the O
rest, O
was O
overcome O
with O
depression. O
He O
went O
to O
his O
waggon, O
clambered O
up O
on O
the O
bales O
and O
lay O
down. O
He O
looked O
at O
the O
sky, O
and O
thought O
of O
happy O
Konstantin O
and O
his O
wife. O
Why O
did O
people O
get O
married? O
What O
were O
women O
in O
the O
world O
for? O
Yegorushka O
put O
the O
vague O
questions O
to O
himself, O
and O
thought O
that O
a O
man O
would O
certainly O
be O
happy O
if O
he O
had O
an O
affectionate, O
merry O
and O
beautiful O
woman O
continually O
living O
at O
his O
side. O
For O
some O
reason O
he O
remembered O
the O
Countess O
Dranitsky, O
and O
thought O
it O
would O
probably O
be O
very O
pleasant O
to O
live O
with O
a O
woman O
like O
that; O
he O
would O
perhaps O
have O
married O
her O
with O
pleasure O
if O
that O
idea O
had O
not O
been O
so O
shameful. O
He O
recalled O
her O
eyebrows, O
the O
pupils O
of O
her O
eyes, O
her O
carriage, O
the O
clock O
with O
the O
horseman. O
. O
. O
. O
The O
soft O
warm O
night O
moved O
softly O
down O
upon O
him O
and O
whispered O
something O
in O
his O
ear, O
and O
it O
seemed O
to O
him O
that O
it O
was O
that O
lovely O
woman O
bending O
over O
him, O
looking O
at O
him O
with O
a O
smile O
and O
meaning O
to O
kiss O
him. O
. O
. O
. O
Nothing O
was O
left O
of O
the O
fire O
but O
two O
little O
red O
eyes, O
which O
kept O
on O
growing O
smaller O
and O
smaller. O
Konstantin O
and O
the O
waggoners O
were O
sitting O
by O
it, O
dark O
motionless O
figures, O
and O
it O
seemed O
as O
though O
there O
were O
many O
more O
of O
them O
than O
before. O
The O
twin O
crosses O
were O
equally O
visible, O
and O
far, O
far O
away, O
somewhere O
by O
the O
highroad O
there O
gleamed O
a O
red O
light-- O
other O
people O
cooking O
their O
porridge, O
most O
likely. O
"Our O
Mother O
Russia O
is O
the O
he-ad O
of O
all O
the O
world!" O
Kiruha O
sang O
out O
suddenly O
in O
a O
harsh O
voice, O
choked O
and O
subsided. O
The O
steppe O
echo O
caught O
up O
his O
voice, O
carried O
it O
on, O
and O
it O
seemed O
as O
though O
stupidity O
itself O
were O
rolling O
on O
heavy O
wheels O
over O
the O
steppe. O
"It's O
time O
to O
go," O
said O
Panteley. O
"Get O
up, O
lads." O
While O
they O
were O
putting O
the O
horses O
in, O
Konstantin O
walked O
by O
the O
waggons O
and O
talked O
rapturously O
of O
his O
wife. O
"Good-bye, O
mates!" O
he O
cried O
when O
the O
waggons O
started. O
"Thank O
you O
for O
your O
hospitality. O
I O
shall O
go O
on O
again O
towards O
that O
light. O
It's O
more O
than O
I O
can O
stand." O
And O
he O
quickly O
vanished O
in O
the O
mist, O
and O
for O
a O
long O
time O
they O
could O
hear O
him O
striding O
in O
the O
direction O
of O
the O
light O
to O
tell O
those O
other O
strangers O
of O
his O
happiness. O
When O
Yegorushka O
woke O
up O
next O
day O
it O
was O
early O
morning; O
the O
sun O
had O
not O
yet O
risen. O
The O
waggons O
were O
at O
a O
standstill. O
A O
man O
in O
a O
white O
cap O
and O
a O
suit O
of O
cheap O
grey O
material, O
mounted O
on O
a O
little O
Cossack O
stallion, O
was O
talking O
to O
Dymov O
and O
Kiruha O
beside O
the O
foremost O
waggon. O
A O
mile O
and O
a O
half O
ahead O
there O
were O
long O
low O
white O
barns O
and O
little O
houses O
with O
tiled O
roofs; O
there O
were O
neither O
yards O
nor O
trees O
to O
be O
seen O
beside O
the O
little O
houses. O
"What O
village O
is O
that, O
Grandfather?" O
asked O
Yegorushka. O
"That's O
the O
Armenian O
Settlement, O
youngster," O
answered O
Panteley. O
"The O
Armenians O
live O
there. O
They O
are O
a O
good O
sort O
of O
people, O
. O
. O
. O
the O
Arnienians O
are." O
The O
man O
in O
grey O
had O
finished O
talking O
to O
Dymov O
and O
Kiruha; O
he O
pulled O
up O
his O
little O
stallion O
and O
looked O
across O
towards O
the O
settlement. O
"What O
a O
business, O
only O
think!" O
sighed O
Panteley, O
looking O
towards O
the O
settlement, O
too, O
and O
shuddering O
at O
the O
morning O
freshness. O
"He O
has O
sent O
a O
man O
to O
the O
settlement O
for O
some O
papers, O
and O
he O
doesn't O
come O
. O
. O
. O
. O
He O
should O
have O
sent O
Styopka." O
"Who O
is O
that, O
Grandfather?" O
asked O
Yegorushka. O
"Varlamov." O
My O
goodness! O
Yegorushka O
jumped O
up O
quickly, O
getting O
upon O
his O
knees, O
and O
looked O
at O
the O
white O
cap. O
It O
was O
hard O
to O
recognize O
the O
mysterious O
elusive O
Varlamov, O
who O
was O
sought O
by O
everyone, O
who O
was O
always O
"on O
his O
rounds," O
and O
who O
had O
far O
more O
money O
than O
Countess O
Dranitsky, O
in O
the O
short, O
grey O
little O
man O
in O
big O
boots, O
who O
was O
sitting O
on O
an O
ugly O
little O
nag O
and O
talking O
to O
peasants O
at O
an O
hour O
when O
all O
decent O
people O
were O
asleep. O
"He O
is O
all O
right, O
a O
good O
man," O
said O
Panteley, O
looking O
towards O
the O
settlement. O
"God O
give O
him O
health O
-- O
a O
splendid O
gentleman, O
Semyon O
Alexandritch. O
. O
. O
. O
It's O
people O
like O
that O
the O
earth O
rests O
upon. O
That's O
true. O
. O
. O
. O
The O
cocks O
are O
not O
crowing O
yet, O
and O
he O
is O
already O
up O
and O
about. O
. O
. O
. O
Another O
man O
would O
be O
asleep, O
or O
gallivanting O
with O
visitors O
at O
home, O
but O
he O
is O
on O
the O
steppe O
all O
day, O
. O
. O
. O
on O
his O
rounds. O
. O
. O
. O
He O
does O
not O
let O
things O
slip. O
. O
. O
. O
No-o! O
He's O
a O
fine O
fellow. O
. O
." O
Varlamov O
was O
talking O
about O
something, O
while O
he O
kept O
his O
eyes O
fixed. O
The O
little O
stallion O
shifted O
from O
one O
leg O
to O
another O
impatiently. O
"Semyon O
Alexandritch!" O
cried O
Panteley, O
taking O
off O
his O
hat. O
"Allow O
us O
to O
send O
Styopka! O
Emelyan, O
call O
out O
that O
Styopka O
should O
be O
sent." O
But O
now O
at O
last O
a O
man O
on O
horseback O
could O
be O
seen O
coming O
from O
the O
settlement. O
Bending O
very O
much O
to O
one O
side O
and O
brandishing O
his O
whip O
above O
his O
head O
like O
a O
gallant O
young O
Caucasian, O
and O
wanting O
to O
astonish O
everyone O
by O
his O
horsemanship, O
he O
flew O
towards O
the O
waggons O
with O
the O
swiftness O
of O
a O
bird. O
"That O
must O
be O
one O
of O
his O
circuit O
men," O
said O
Panteley. O
"He O
must O
have O
a O
hundred O
such O
horsemen O
or O
maybe O
more." O
Reaching O
the O
first O
waggon, O
he O
pulled O
up O
his O
horse, O
and O
taking O
off O
his O
hat, O
handed O
Varlamov O
a O
little O
book. O
Varlamov O
took O
several O
papers O
out O
of O
the O
book, O
read O
them O
and O
cried: O
"And O
where O
is O
Ivantchuk's O
letter?" O
The O
horseman O
took O
the O
book O
back, O
looked O
at O
the O
papers O
and O
shrugged O
his O
shoulders. O
He O
began O
saying O
something, O
probably O
justifying O
himself O
and O
asking O
to O
be O
allowed O
to O
ride O
back O
to O
the O
settlement O
again. O
The O
little O
stallion O
suddenly O
stirred O
as O
though O
Varlamov O
had O
grown O
heavier. O
Varlamov O
stirred O
too. O
"Go O
along!" O
he O
cried O
angrily, O
and O
he O
waved O
his O
whip O
at O
the O
man. O
Then O
he O
turned O
his O
horse O
round O
and, O
looking O
through O
the O
papers O
in O
the O
book, O
moved O
at O
a O
walking O
pace O
alongside O
the O
waggons. O
When O
he O
reached O
the O
hindmost, O
Yegorushka O
strained O
his O
eyes O
to O
get O
a O
better O
look O
at O
him. O
Varlamov O
was O
an O
elderly O
man. O
His O
face, O
a O
simple O
Russian O
sunburnt O
face O
with O
a O
small O
grey O
beard, O
was O
red, O
wet O
with O
dew O
and O
covered O
with O
little O
blue O
veins; O
it O
had O
the O
same O
expression O
of O
businesslike O
coldness O
as O
Ivan O
Ivanitch's O
face, O
the O
same O
look O
of O
fanatical O
zeal O
for O
business. O
But O
yet O
what O
a O
difference O
could O
be O
felt O
between O
him O
and O
Kuzmitchov! O
Uncle O
Ivan O
Ivanitch O
always O
had O
on O
his O
face, O
together O
with O
his O
business-like O
reserve, O
a O
look O
of O
anxiety O
and O
apprehension O
that O
he O
would O
not O
find O
Varlamov, O
that O
he O
would O
be O
late, O
that O
he O
would O
miss O
a O
good O
price; O
nothing O
of O
that O
sort, O
so O
characteristic O
of O
small O
and O
dependent O
persons, O
could O
be O
seen O
in O
the O
face O
or O
figure O
of O
Varlamov. O
This O
man O
made O
the O
price O
himself, O
was O
not O
looking O
for O
anyone, O
and O
did O
not O
depend O
on O
anyone; O
however O
ordinary O
his O
exterior, O
yet O
in O
everything, O
even O
in O
the O
manner O
of O
holding O
his O
whip, O
there O
was O
a O
sense O
of O
power O
and O
habitual O
authority O
over O
the O
steppe. O
As O
he O
rode O
by O
Yegorushka O
he O
did O
not O
glance O
at O
him. O
Only O
the O
little O
stallion O
deigned O
to O
notice O
Yegorushka; O
he O
looked O
at O
him O
with O
his O
large O
foolish O
eyes, O
and O
even O
he O
showed O
no O
interest. O
Panteley O
bowed O
to O
Varlamov; O
the O
latter O
noticed O
it, O
and O
without O
taking O
his O
eyes O
off O
the O
sheets O
of O
paper, O
said O
lisping: O
"How O
are O
you, O
old O
man?" O
Varlamov's O
conversation O
with O
the O
horseman O
and O
the O
way O
he O
had O
brandished O
his O
whip O
had O
evidently O
made O
an O
overwhelming O
impression O
on O
the O
whole O
party. O
Everyone O
looked O
grave. O
The O
man O
on O
horseback, O
cast O
down O
at O
the O
anger O
of O
the O
great O
man, O
remained O
stationary, O
with O
his O
hat O
off, O
and O
the O
rein O
loose O
by O
the O
foremost O
waggon; O
he O
was O
silent, O
and O
seemed O
unable O
to O
grasp O
that O
the O
day O
had O
begun O
so O
badly O
for O
him. O
"He O
is O
a O
harsh O
old O
man, O
. O
." O
muttered O
Panteley. O
"It's O
a O
pity O
he O
is O
so O
harsh! O
But O
he O
is O
all O
right, O
a O
good O
man. O
. O
. O
. O
He O
doesn't O
abuse O
men O
for O
nothing. O
. O
. O
. O
It's O
no O
matter. O
. O
. O
." O
After O
examining O
the O
papers, O
Varlamov O
thrust O
the O
book O
into O
his O
pocket; O
the O
little O
stallion, O
as O
though O
he O
knew O
what O
was O
in O
his O
mind, O
without O
waiting O
for O
orders, O
started O
and O
dashed O
along O
the O
highroad. O
VII O
On O
the O
following O
night O
the O
waggoners O
had O
halted O
and O
were O
cooking O
their O
porridge. O
On O
this O
occasion O
there O
was O
a O
sense O
of O
overwhelming O
oppression O
over O
everyone. O
It O
was O
sultry; O
they O
all O
drank O
a O
great O
deal, O
but O
could O
not O
quench O
their O
thirst. O
The O
moon O
was O
intensely O
crimson O
and O
sullen, O
as O
though O
it O
were O
sick. O
The O
stars, O
too, O
were O
sullen, O
the O
mist O
was O
thicker, O
the O
distance O
more O
clouded. O
Nature O
seemed O
as O
though O
languid O
and O
weighed O
down O
by O
some O
foreboding. O
There O
was O
not O
the O
same O
liveliness O
and O
talk O
round O
the O
camp O
fire O
as O
there O
had O
been O
the O
day O
before. O
All O
were O
dreary O
and O
spoke O
listlessly O
and O
without O
interest. O
Panteley O
did O
nothing O
but O
sigh O
and O
complain O
of O
his O
feet, O
and O
continually O
alluded O
to O
impenitent O
deathbeds. O
Dymov O
was O
lying O
on O
his O
stomach, O
chewing O
a O
straw O
in O
silence; O
there O
was O
an O
expression O
of O
disgust O
on O
his O
face O
as O
though O
the O
straw O
smelt O
unpleasant, O
a O
spiteful O
and O
exhausted O
look. O
. O
. O
. O
Vassya O
complained O
that O
his O
jaw O
ached, O
and O
prophesied O
bad O
weather; O
Emelyan O
was O
not O
waving O
his O
arms, O
but O
sitting O
still O
and O
looking O
gloomily O
at O
the O
fire. O
Yegorushka, O
too, O
was O
weary. O
This O
slow O
travelling O
exhausted O
him, O
and O
the O
sultriness O
of O
the O
day O
had O
given O
him O
a O
headache. O
While O
they O
were O
cooking O
the O
porridge, O
Dymov, O
to O
relieve O
his O
boredom, O
began O
quarrelling O
with O
his O
companions. O
"Here O
he O
lolls, O
the O
lumpy O
face, O
and O
is O
the O
first O
to O
put O
his O
spoon O
in," O
he O
said, O
looking O
spitefully O
at O
Emelyan. O
"Greedy! O
always O
contrives O
to O
sit O
next O
the O
cauldron. O
He's O
been O
a O
church-singer, O
so O
he O
thinks O
he O
is O
a O
gentleman! O
There O
are O
a O
lot O
of O
singers O
like O
you O
begging O
along O
the O
highroad!" O
"What O
are O
you O
pestering O
me O
for?" O
asked O
Emelyan, O
looking O
at O
him O
angrily. O
"To O
teach O
you O
not O
to O
be O
the O
first O
to O
dip O
into O
the O
cauldron. O
Don't O
think O
too O
much O
of O
yourself!" O
"You O
are O
a O
fool, O
and O
that O
is O
all O
about O
it!" O
wheezed O
out O
Emelyan. O
Knowing O
by O
experience O
how O
such O
conversations O
usually O
ended, O
Panteley O
and O
Vassya O
intervened O
and O
tried O
to O
persuade O
Dymov O
not O
to O
quarrel O
about O
nothing. O
"A O
church-singer!" O
The O
bully O
would O
not O
desist, O
but O
laughed O
contemptuously. O
"Anyone O
can O
sing O
like O
that-- O
sit O
in O
the O
church O
porch O
and O
sing O
'Give O
me O
alms, O
for O
Christ's O
sake!' O
Ugh! O
you O
are O
a O
nice O
fellow!" O
Emelyan O
did O
not O
speak. O
His O
silence O
had O
an O
irritating O
effect O
on O
Dymov. O
He O
looked O
with O
still O
greater O
hatred O
at O
the O
ex-singer O
and O
said: O
"I O
don't O
care O
to O
have O
anything O
to O
do O
with O
you, O
or O
I O
would O
show O
you O
what O
to O
think O
of O
yourself." O
"But O
why O
are O
you O
pushing O
me, O
you O
Mazeppa?" O
Emelyan O
cried, O
flaring O
up. O
"Am O
I O
interfering O
with O
you?" O
"What O
did O
you O
call O
me?" O
asked O
Dymov, O
drawing O
himself O
up, O
and O
his O
eyes O
were O
suffused O
with O
blood. O
"Eh! O
I O
am O
a O
Mazeppa? O
Yes? O
Take O
that, O
then; O
go O
and O
look O
for O
it." O
Dymov O
snatched O
the O
spoon O
out O
of O
Emelyan's O
hand O
and O
flung O
it O
far O
away. O
Kiruha, O
Vassya, O
and O
Styopka O
ran O
to O
look O
for O
it, O
while O
Emelyan O
fixed O
an O
imploring O
and O
questioning O
look O
on O
Panteley. O
His O
face O
suddenly O
became O
small O
and O
wrinkled; O
it O
began O
twitching, O
and O
the O
ex-singer O
began O
to O
cry O
like O
a O
child. O
Yegorushka, O
who O
had O
long O
hated O
Dymov, O
felt O
as O
though O
the O
air O
all O
at O
once O
were O
unbearably O
stifling, O
as O
though O
the O
fire O
were O
scorching O
his O
face; O
he O
longed O
to O
run O
quickly O
to O
the O
waggons O
in O
the O
darkness, O
but O
the O
bully's O
angry O
bored O
eyes O
drew O
the O
boy O
to O
him. O
With O
a O
passionate O
desire O
to O
say O
something O
extremely O
offensive, O
he O
took O
a O
step O
towards O
Dymov O
and O
brought O
out, O
gasping O
for O
breath: O
"You O
are O
the O
worst O
of O
the O
lot; O
I O
can't O
bear O
you!" O
After O
this O
he O
ought O
to O
have O
run O
to O
the O
waggons, O
but O
he O
could O
not O
stir O
from O
the O
spot O
and O
went O
on: O
"In O
the O
next O
world O
you O
will O
burn O
in O
hell! O
I'll O
complain O
to O
Ivan O
Ivanitch. O
Don't O
you O
dare O
insult O
Emelyan!" O
"Say O
this O
too, O
please," O
laughed O
Dyrnov: O
"'every O
little O
sucking-pig O
wants O
to O
lay O
down O
the O
law.' O
Shall O
I O
pull O
your O
ear?" O
Yegorushka O
felt O
that O
he O
could O
not O
breathe; O
and O
something O
which O
had O
never O
happened O
to O
him O
before-- O
he O
suddenly O
began O
shaking O
all O
over, O
stamping O
his O
feet O
and O
crying O
shrilly: O
"Beat O
him, O
beat O
him!" O
Tears O
gushed O
from O
his O
eyes; O
he O
felt O
ashamed, O
and O
ran O
staggering O
back O
to O
the O
waggon. O
The O
effect O
produced O
by O
his O
outburst O
he O
did O
not O
see. O
Lying O
on O
the O
bales O
and O
twitching O
his O
arms O
and O
legs, O
he O
whispered: O
"Mother, O
mother!" O
And O
these O
men O
and O
the O
shadows O
round O
the O
camp O
fire, O
and O
the O
dark O
bales O
and O
the O
far-away O
lightning, O
which O
was O
flashing O
every O
minute O
in O
the O
distance-- O
all O
struck O
him O
now O
as O
terrible O
and O
unfriendly. O
He O
was O
overcome O
with O
terror O
and O
asked O
himself O
in O
despair O
why O
and O
how O
he O
had O
come O
into O
this O
unknown O
land O
in O
the O
company O
of O
terrible O
peasants? O
Where O
was O
his O
uncle O
now, O
where O
was O
Father O
Christopher, O
where O
was O
Deniska? O
Why O
were O
they O
so O
long O
in O
coming? O
Hadn't O
they O
forgotten O
him? O
At O
the O
thought O
that O
he O
was O
forgotten O
and O
cast O
out O
to O
the O
mercy O
of O
fate, O
he O
felt O
such O
a O
cold O
chill O
of O
dread O
that O
he O
had O
several O
times O
an O
impulse O
to O
jump O
off O
the O
bales O
of O
wool, O
and O
run O
back O
full O
speed O
along O
the O
road; O
but O
the O
thought O
of O
the O
huge O
dark O
crosses, O
which O
would O
certainly O
meet O
him O
on O
the O
way, O
and O
the O
lightning O
flashing O
in O
the O
distance, O
stopped O
him. O
. O
. O
. O
And O
only O
when O
he O
whispered, O
"Mother, O
mother!" O
he O
felt O
as O
it O
were O
a O
little O
better. O
The O
waggoners O
must O
have O
been O
full O
of O
dread, O
too. O
After O
Yegorushka O
had O
run O
away O
from O
the O
camp O
fire O
they O
sat O
at O
first O
for O
a O
long O
time O
in O
silence, O
then O
they O
began O
speaking O
in O
hollow O
undertones O
about O
something, O
saying O
that O
it O
was O
coming O
and O
that O
they O
must O
make O
haste O
and O
get O
away O
from O
it. O
. O
. O
. O
They O
quickly O
finished O
supper, O
put O
out O
the O
fire O
and O
began O
harnessing O
the O
horses O
in O
silence. O
From O
their O
fluster O
and O
the O
broken O
phrases O
they O
uttered O
it O
was O
apparent O
they O
foresaw O
some O
trouble. O
Before O
they O
set O
off O
on O
their O
way, O
Dymov O
went O
up O
to O
Panteley O
and O
asked O
softly: O
"What's O
his O
name?" O
"Yegory," O
answered O
Panteley. O
Dymov O
put O
one O
foot O
on O
the O
wheel, O
caught O
hold O
of O
the O
cord O
which O
was O
tied O
round O
the O
bales O
and O
pulled O
himself O
up. O
Yegorushka O
saw O
his O
face O
and O
curly O
head. O
The O
face O
was O
pale O
and O
looked O
grave O
and O
exhausted, O
but O
there O
was O
no O
expression O
of O
spite O
in O
it. O
"Yera!" O
he O
said O
softly, O
"here, O
hit O
me!" O
Yegorushka O
looked O
at O
him O
in O
surprise. O
At O
that O
instant O
there O
was O
a O
flash O
of O
lightning. O
"It's O
all O
right, O
hit O
me," O
repeated O
Dymov. O
And O
without O
waiting O
for O
Yegorushka O
to O
hit O
him O
or O
to O
speak O
to O
him, O
he O
jumped O
down O
and O
said: O
"How O
dreary O
I O
am!" O
Then, O
swaying O
from O
one O
leg O
to O
the O
other O
and O
moving O
his O
shoulder-blades, O
he O
sauntered O
lazily O
alongside O
the O
string O
of O
waggons O
and O
repeated O
in O
a O
voice O
half O
weeping, O
half O
angry: O
"How O
dreary O
I O
am! O
O O
Lord! O
Don't O
you O
take O
offence, O
Emelyan," O
he O
said O
as O
he O
passed O
Emelyan. O
"Ours O
is O
a O
wretched O
cruel O
life!" O
There O
was O
a O
flash O
of O
lightning O
on O
the O
right, O
and, O
like O
a O
reflection O
in O
the O
looking-glass, O
at O
once O
a O
second O
flash O
in O
the O
distance. O
"Yegory, O
take O
this," O
cried O
Panteley, O
throwing O
up O
something O
big O
and O
dark. O
"What O
is O
it?" O
asked O
Yegorushka. O
"A O
mat. O
There O
will O
be O
rain, O
so O
cover O
yourself O
up." O
Yegorushka O
sat O
up O
and O
looked O
about O
him. O
The O
distance O
had O
grown O
perceptibly O
blacker, O
and O
now O
oftener O
than O
every O
minute O
winked O
with O
a O
pale O
light. O
The O
blackness O
was O
being O
bent O
towards O
the O
right O
as O
though O
by O
its O
own O
weight. O
"Will O
there O
be O
a O
storm, O
Grandfather?" O
asked O
Yegorushka. O
"Ah, O
my O
poor O
feet, O
how O
they O
ache!" O
Panteley O
said O
in O
a O
high-pitched O
voice, O
stamping O
his O
feet O
and O
not O
hearing O
the O
boy. O
On O
the O
left O
someone O
seemed O
to O
strike O
a O
match O
in O
the O
sky; O
a O
pale O
phosphorescent O
streak O
gleamed O
and O
went O
out. O
There O
was O
a O
sound O
as O
though O
someone O
very O
far O
away O
were O
walking O
over O
an O
iron O
roof, O
probably O
barefoot, O
for O
the O
iron O
gave O
a O
hollow O
rumble. O
"It's O
set O
in!" O
cried O
Kiruha. O
Between O
the O
distance O
and O
the O
horizon O
on O
the O
right O
there O
was O
a O
flash O
of O
lightning O
so O
vivid O
that O
it O
lighted O
up O
part O
of O
the O
steppe O
and O
the O
spot O
where O
the O
clear O
sky O
met O
the O
blackness. O
A O
terrible O
cloud O
was O
swooping O
down, O
without O
haste, O
a O
compact O
mass; O
big O
black O
shreds O
hung O
from O
its O
edge; O
similar O
shreds O
pressing O
one O
upon O
another O
were O
piling O
up O
on O
the O
right O
and O
left O
horizon. O
The O
tattered, O
ragged O
look O
of O
the O
storm-cloud O
gave O
it O
a O
drunken O
disorderly O
air. O
There O
was O
a O
distinct, O
not O
smothered, O
growl O
of O
thunder. O
Yegorushka O
crossed O
himself O
and O
began O
quickly O
putting O
on O
his O
great-coat. O
"I O
am O
dreary!" O
Dymov's O
shout O
floated O
from O
the O
foremost O
waggon, O
and O
it O
could O
be O
told O
from O
his O
voice O
that O
he O
was O
beginning O
to O
be O
ill-humoured O
again. O
"I O
am O
so O
dreary!" O
All O
at O
once O
there O
was O
a O
squall O
of O
wind, O
so O
violent O
that O
it O
almost O
snatched O
away O
Yegorushka's O
bundle O
and O
mat; O
the O
mat O
fluttered O
in O
all O
directions O
and O
flapped O
on O
the O
bale O
and O
on O
Yegorushka's O
face. O
The O
wind O
dashed O
whistling O
over O
the O
steppe, O
whirled O
round O
in O
disorder O
and O
raised O
such O
an O
uproar O
from O
the O
grass O
that O
neither O
the O
thunder O
nor O
the O
creaking O
of O
the O
wheels O
could O
be O
heard; O
it O
blew O
from O
the O
black O
storm-cloud, O
carrying O
with O
it O
clouds O
of O
dust O
and O
the O
scent O
of O
rain O
and O
wet O
earth. O
The O
moonlight O
grew O
mistier, O
as O
it O
were O
dirtier; O
the O
stars O
were O
even O
more O
overcast; O
and O
clouds O
of O
dust O
could O
be O
seen O
hurrying O
along O
the O
edge O
of O
the O
road, O
followed O
by O
their O
shadows. O
By O
now, O
most O
likely, O
the O
whirlwind O
eddying O
round O
and O
lifting O
from O
the O
earth O
dust, O
dry O
grass O
and O
feathers, O
was O
mounting O
to O
the O
very O
sky; O
uprooted O
plants O
must O
have O
been O
flying O
by O
that O
very O
black O
storm-cloud, O
and O
how O
frightened O
they O
must O
have O
been! O
But O
through O
the O
dust O
that O
clogged O
the O
eyes O
nothing O
could O
be O
seen O
but O
the O
flash O
of O
lightning. O
Yegorushka, O
thinking O
it O
would O
pour O
with O
rain O
in O
a O
minute, O
knelt O
up O
and O
covered O
himself O
with O
the O
mat. O
"Panteley-ey!" O
someone O
shouted O
in O
the O
front. O
"A. O
. O
. O
a. O
. O
. O
va!" O
"I O
can't!" O
Panteley O
answered O
in O
a O
loud O
high O
voice. O
"A O
. O
. O
. O
a O
. O
. O
. O
va! O
Arya O
. O
. O
. O
a!" O
There O
was O
an O
angry O
clap O
of O
thunder, O
which O
rolled O
across O
the O
sky O
from O
right O
to O
left, O
then O
back O
again, O
and O
died O
away O
near O
the O
foremost O
waggon. O
"Holy, O
holy, O
holy, O
Lord O
of O
Sabaoth," O
whispered O
Yegorushka, O
crossing O
himself. O
"Fill O
heaven O
and O
earth O
with O
Thy O
glory." O
The O
blackness O
in O
the O
sky O
yawned O
wide O
and O
breathed O
white O
fire. O
At O
once O
there O
was O
another O
clap O
of O
thunder. O
It O
had O
scarcely O
ceased O
when O
there O
was O
a O
flash O
of O
lightning O
so O
broad O
that O
Yegorushka O
suddenly O
saw O
through O
a O
slit O
in O
the O
mat O
the O
whole O
highroad O
to O
the O
very O
horizon, O
all O
the O
waggoners O
and O
even O
Kiruha's O
waistcoat. O
The O
black O
shreds O
had O
by O
now O
moved O
upwards O
from O
the O
left, O
and O
one O
of O
them, O
a O
coarse, O
clumsy O
monster O
like O
a O
claw O
with O
fingers, O
stretched O
to O
the O
moon. O
Yegorushka O
made O
up O
his O
mind O
to O
shut O
his O
eyes O
tight, O
to O
pay O
no O
attention O
to O
it, O
and O
to O
wait O
till O
it O
was O
all O
over. O
The O
rain O
was O
for O
some O
reason O
long O
in O
coming. O
Yegorushka O
peeped O
out O
from O
the O
mat O
in O
the O
hope O
that O
perhaps O
the O
storm-cloud O
was O
passing O
over. O
It O
was O
fearfully O
dark. O
Yegorushka O
could O
see O
neither O
Panteley, O
nor O
the O
bale O
of O
wool, O
nor O
himself; O
he O
looked O
sideways O
towards O
the O
place O
where O
the O
moon O
had O
lately O
been, O
but O
there O
was O
the O
same O
black O
darkness O
there O
as O
over O
the O
waggons. O
And O
in O
the O
darkness O
the O
flashes O
of O
lightning O
seemed O
more O
violent O
and O
blinding, O
so O
that O
they O
hurt O
his O
eyes. O
"Panteley!" O
called O
Yegorushka. O
No O
answer O
followed. O
But O
now O
a O
gust O
of O
wind O
for O
the O
last O
time O
flung O
up O
the O
mat O
and O
hurried O
away. O
A O
quiet O
regular O
sound O
was O
heard. O
A O
big O
cold O
drop O
fell O
on O
Yegorushka's O
knee, O
another O
trickled O
over O
his O
hand. O
He O
noticed O
that O
his O
knees O
were O
not O
covered, O
and O
tried O
to O
rearrange O
the O
mat, O
but O
at O
that O
moment O
something O
began O
pattering O
on O
the O
road, O
then O
on O
the O
shafts O
and O
the O
bales. O
It O
was O
the O
rain. O
As O
though O
they O
understood O
one O
another, O
the O
rain O
and O
the O
mat O
began O
prattling O
of O
something O
rapidly, O
gaily O
and O
most O
annoyingly O
like O
two O
magpies. O
Yegorushka O
knelt O
up O
or O
rather O
squatted O
on O
his O
boots. O
While O
the O
rain O
was O
pattering O
on O
the O
mat, O
he O
leaned O
forward O
to O
screen O
his O
knees, O
which O
were O
suddenly O
wet. O
He O
succeeded O
in O
covering O
his O
knees, O
but O
in O
less O
than O
a O
minute O
was O
aware O
of O
a O
penetrating, O
unpleasant O
dampness O
behind O
on O
his O
back O
and O
the O
calves O
of O
his O
legs. O
He O
returned O
to O
his O
former O
position, O
exposing O
his O
knees O
to O
the O
rain, O
and O
wondered O
what O
to O
do O
to O
rearrange O
the O
mat O
which O
he O
could O
not O
see O
in O
the O
darkness. O
But O
his O
arms O
were O
already O
wet, O
the O
water O
was O
trickling O
up O
his O
sleeves O
and O
down O
his O
collar, O
and O
his O
shoulder-blades O
felt O
chilly. O
And O
he O
made O
up O
his O
mind O
to O
do O
nothing O
but O
sit O
motionless O
and O
wait O
till O
it O
was O
all O
over. O
"Holy, O
holy, O
holy!" O
he O
whispered. O
Suddenly, O
exactly O
over O
his O
head, O
the O
sky O
cracked O
with O
a O
fearful O
deafening O
din; O
he O
huddled O
up O
and O
held O
his O
breath, O
waiting O
for O
the O
fragments O
to O
fall O
upon O
his O
head O
and O
back. O
He O
inadvertently O
opened O
his O
eyes O
and O
saw O
a O
blinding O
intense O
light O
flare O
out O
and O
flash O
five O
times O
on O
his O
fingers, O
his O
wet O
sleeves, O
and O
on O
the O
trickles O
of O
water O
running O
from O
the O
mat O
upon O
the O
bales O
and O
down O
to O
the O
ground. O
There O
was O
a O
fresh O
peal O
of O
thunder O
as O
violent O
and O
awful; O
the O
sky O
was O
not O
growling O
and O
rumbling O
now, O
but O
uttering O
short O
crashing O
sounds O
like O
the O
crackling O
of O
dry O
wood. O
"Trrah! O
tah! O
tah! O
tah!" O
the O
thunder O
rang O
out O
distinctly, O
rolled O
over O
the O
sky, O
seemed O
to O
stumble, O
and O
somewhere O
by O
the O
foremost O
waggons O
or O
far O
behind O
to O
fall O
with O
an O
abrupt O
angry O
"Trrra!" O
The O
flashes O
of O
lightning O
had O
at O
first O
been O
only O
terrible, O
but O
with O
such O
thunder O
they O
seemed O
sinister O
and O
menacing. O
Their O
magic O
light O
pierced O
through O
closed O
eyelids O
and O
sent O
a O
chill O
all O
over O
the O
body. O
What O
could O
he O
do O
not O
to O
see O
them? O
Yegorushka O
made O
up O
his O
mind O
to O
turn O
over O
on O
his O
face. O
Cautiously, O
as O
though O
afraid O
of O
being O
watched, O
he O
got O
on O
all O
fours, O
and O
his O
hands O
slipping O
on O
the O
wet O
bale, O
he O
turned O
back O
again. O
"Trrah! O
tah! O
tah!" O
floated O
over O
his O
head, O
rolled O
under O
the O
waggons O
and O
exploded O
"Kraa!" O
Again O
he O
inadvertently O
opened O
his O
eyes O
and O
saw O
a O
new O
danger: O
three O
huge O
giants O
with O
long O
pikes O
were O
following O
the O
waggon! O
A O
flash O
of O
lightning O
gleamed O
on O
the O
points O
of O
their O
pikes O
and O
lighted O
up O
their O
figures O
very O
distinctly. O
They O
were O
men O
of O
huge O
proportions, O
with O
covered O
faces, O
bowed O
heads, O
and O
heavy O
footsteps. O
They O
seemed O
gloomy O
and O
dispirited O
and O
lost O
in O
thought. O
Perhaps O
they O
were O
not O
following O
the O
waggons O
with O
any O
harmful O
intent, O
and O
yet O
there O
was O
something O
awful O
in O
their O
proximity. O
Yegorushka O
turned O
quickly O
forward, O
and O
trembling O
all O
over O
cried: O
"Panteley! O
Grandfather!" O
"Trrah! O
tah! O
tah!" O
the O
sky O
answered O
him. O
He O
opened O
his O
eyes O
to O
see O
if O
the O
waggoners O
were O
there. O
There O
were O
flashes O
of O
lightning O
in O
two O
places, O
which O
lighted O
up O
the O
road O
to O
the O
far O
distance, O
the O
whole O
string O
of O
waggons O
and O
all O
the O
waggoners. O
Streams O
of O
water O
were O
flowing O
along O
the O
road O
and O
bubbles O
were O
dancing. O
Panteley O
was O
walking O
beside O
the O
waggon; O
his O
tall O
hat O
and O
his O
shoulder O
were O
covered O
with O
a O
small O
mat; O
his O
figure O
expressed O
neither O
terror O
nor O
uneasiness, O
as O
though O
he O
were O
deafened O
by O
the O
thunder O
and O
blinded O
by O
the O
lightning. O
"Grandfather, O
the O
giants!" O
Yegorushka O
shouted O
to O
him O
in O
tears. O
But O
the O
old O
man O
did O
not O
hear. O
Further O
away O
walked O
Emelyan. O
He O
was O
covered O
from O
head O
to O
foot O
with O
a O
big O
mat O
and O
was O
triangular O
in O
shape. O
Vassya, O
without O
anything O
over O
him, O
was O
walking O
with O
the O
same O
wooden O
step O
as O
usual, O
lifting O
his O
feet O
high O
and O
not O
bending O
his O
knees. O
In O
the O
flash O
of O
lightning O
it O
seemed O
as O
though O
the O
waggons O
were O
not O
moving O
and O
the O
men O
were O
motionless, O
that O
Vassya's O
lifted O
foot O
was O
rigid O
in O
the O
same O
position. O
. O
. O
. O
Yegorushka O
called O
the O
old O
man O
once O
more. O
Getting O
no O
answer, O
he O
sat O
motionless, O
and O
no O
longer O
waited O
for O
it O
all O
to O
end. O
He O
was O
convinced O
that O
the O
thunder O
would O
kill O
him O
in O
another O
minute, O
that O
he O
would O
accidentally O
open O
his O
eyes O
and O
see O
the O
terrible O
giants, O
and O
he O
left O
off O
crossing O
himself, O
calling O
the O
old O
man O
and O
thinking O
of O
his O
mother, O
and O
was O
simply O
numb O
with O
cold O
and O
the O
conviction O
that O
the O
storm O
would O
never O
end. O
But O
at O
last O
there O
was O
the O
sound O
of O
voices. O
"Yegory, O
are O
you O
asleep?" O
Panteley O
cried O
below. O
"Get O
down! O
Is O
he O
deaf, O
the O
silly O
little O
thing? O
. O
. O
." O
"Something O
like O
a O
storm!" O
said O
an O
unfamiliar O
bass O
voice, O
and O
the O
stranger O
cleared O
his O
throat O
as O
though O
he O
had O
just O
tossed O
off O
a O
good O
glass O
of O
vodka. O
Yegorushka O
opened O
his O
eyes. O
Close O
to O
the O
waggon O
stood O
Panteley, O
Emelyan, O
looking O
like O
a O
triangle, O
and O
the O
giants. O
The O
latter O
were O
by O
now O
much O
shorter, O
and O
when O
Yegorushka O
looked O
more O
closely O
at O
them O
they O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
ordinary O
peasants, O
carrying O
on O
their O
shoulders O
not O
pikes O
but O
pitchforks. O
In O
the O
space O
between O
Panteley O
and O
the O
triangular O
figure, O
gleamed O
the O
window O
of O
a O
low-pitched O
hut. O
So O
the O
waggons O
were O
halting O
in O
the O
village. O
Yegorushka O
flung O
off O
the O
mat, O
took O
his O
bundle O
and O
made O
haste O
to O
get O
off O
the O
waggon. O
Now O
when O
close O
to O
him O
there O
were O
people O
talking O
and O
a O
lighted O
window O
he O
no O
longer O
felt O
afraid, O
though O
the O
thunder O
was O
crashing O
as O
before O
and O
the O
whole O
sky O
was O
streaked O
with O
lightning. O
"It O
was O
a O
good O
storm, O
all O
right, O
. O
. O
." O
Panteley O
was O
muttering. O
"Thank O
God, O
. O
. O
. O
my O
feet O
are O
a O
little O
softened O
by O
the O
rain. O
It O
was O
all O
right. O
. O
. O
. O
Have O
you O
got O
down, O
Yegory? O
Well, O
go O
into O
the O
hut; O
it O
is O
all O
right. O
. O
. O
." O
"Holy, O
holy, O
holy!" O
wheezed O
Emelyan, O
"it O
must O
have O
struck O
something O
. O
. O
. O
. O
Are O
you O
of O
these O
parts?" O
he O
asked O
the O
giants. O
"No, O
from O
Glinovo. O
We O
belong O
to O
Glinovo. O
We O
are O
working O
at O
the O
Platers'." O
"Threshing?" O
"All O
sorts. O
Just O
now O
we O
are O
getting O
in O
the O
wheat. O
The O
lightning, O
the O
lightning! O
It O
is O
long O
since O
we O
have O
had O
such O
a O
storm. O
. O
. O
." O
Yegorushka O
went O
into O
the O
hut. O
He O
was O
met O
by O
a O
lean O
hunchbacked O
old O
woman O
with O
a O
sharp O
chin. O
She O
stood O
holding O
a O
tallow O
candle O
in O
her O
hands, O
screwing O
up O
her O
eyes O
and O
heaving O
prolonged O
sighs. O
"What O
a O
storm O
God O
has O
sent O
us!" O
she O
said. O
"And O
our O
lads O
are O
out O
for O
the O
night O
on O
the O
steppe; O
they'll O
have O
a O
bad O
time, O
poor O
dears! O
Take O
off O
your O
things, O
little O
sir, O
take O
off O
your O
things." O
Shivering O
with O
cold O
and O
shrugging O
squeamishly, O
Yegorushka O
pulled O
off O
his O
drenched O
overcoat, O
then O
stretched O
out O
his O
arms O
and O
straddled O
his O
legs, O
and O
stood O
a O
long O
time O
without O
moving. O
The O
slightest O
movement O
caused O
an O
unpleasant O
sensation O
of O
cold O
and O
wetness. O
His O
sleeves O
and O
the O
back O
of O
his O
shirt O
were O
sopped, O
his O
trousers O
stuck O
to O
his O
legs, O
his O
head O
was O
dripping. O
"What's O
the O
use O
of O
standing O
there, O
with O
your O
legs O
apart, O
little O
lad?" O
said O
the O
old O
woman. O
"Come, O
sit O
down." O
Holding O
his O
legs O
wide O
apart, O
Yegorushka O
went O
up O
to O
the O
table O
and O
sat O
down O
on O
a O
bench O
near O
somebody's O
head. O
The O
head O
moved, O
puffed O
a O
stream O
of O
air O
through O
its O
nose, O
made O
a O
chewing O
sound O
and O
subsided. O
A O
mound O
covered O
with O
a O
sheepskin O
stretched O
from O
the O
head O
along O
the O
bench; O
it O
was O
a O
peasant O
woman O
asleep. O
The O
old O
woman O
went O
out O
sighing, O
and O
came O
back O
with O
a O
big O
water O
melon O
and O
a O
little O
sweet O
melon. O
"Have O
something O
to O
eat, O
my O
dear! O
I O
have O
nothing O
else O
to O
offer O
you, O
. O
. O
." O
she O
said, O
yawning. O
She O
rummaged O
in O
the O
table O
and O
took O
out O
a O
long O
sharp O
knife, O
very O
much O
like O
the O
one O
with O
which O
the O
brigands O
killed O
the O
merchants O
in O
the O
inn. O
"Have O
some, O
my O
dear!" O
Yegorushka, O
shivering O
as O
though O
he O
were O
in O
a O
fever, O
ate O
a O
slice O
of O
sweet O
melon O
with O
black O
bread O
and O
then O
a O
slice O
of O
water O
melon, O
and O
that O
made O
him O
feel O
colder O
still. O
"Our O
lads O
are O
out O
on O
the O
steppe O
for O
the O
night, O
. O
. O
." O
sighed O
the O
old O
woman O
while O
he O
was O
eating. O
"The O
terror O
of O
the O
Lord! O
I'd O
light O
the O
candle O
under O
the O
ikon, O
but O
I O
don't O
know O
where O
Stepanida O
has O
put O
it. O
Have O
some O
more, O
little O
sir, O
have O
some O
more. O
. O
. O
." O
The O
old O
woman O
gave O
a O
yawn O
and, O
putting O
her O
right O
hand O
behind O
her, O
scratched O
her O
left O
shoulder. O
"It O
must O
be O
two O
o'clock O
now," O
she O
said; O
"it O
will O
soon O
be O
time O
to O
get O
up. O
Our O
lads O
are O
out O
on O
the O
steppe O
for O
the O
night; O
they O
are O
all O
wet O
through O
for O
sure. O
. O
. O
." O
"Granny," O
said O
Yegorushka. O
"I O
am O
sleepy." O
"Lie O
down, O
my O
dear, O
lie O
down," O
the O
old O
woman O
sighed, O
yawning. O
"Lord O
Jesus O
Christ! O
I O
was O
asleep, O
when O
I O
heard O
a O
noise O
as O
though O
someone O
were O
knocking. O
I O
woke O
up O
and O
looked, O
and O
it O
was O
the O
storm O
God O
had O
sent O
us. O
. O
. O
. O
I'd O
have O
lighted O
the O
candle, O
but O
I O
couldn't O
find O
it." O
Talking O
to O
herself, O
she O
pulled O
some O
rags, O
probably O
her O
own O
bed, O
off O
the O
bench, O
took O
two O
sheepskins O
off O
a O
nail O
by O
the O
stove, O
and O
began O
laying O
them O
out O
for O
a O
bed O
for O
Yegorushka. O
"The O
storm O
doesn't O
grow O
less," O
she O
muttered. O
"If O
only O
nothing's O
struck O
in O
an O
unlucky O
hour. O
Our O
lads O
are O
out O
on O
the O
steppe O
for O
the O
night. O
Lie O
down O
and O
sleep, O
my O
dear. O
. O
. O
. O
Christ O
be O
with O
you, O
my O
child. O
. O
. O
. O
I O
won't O
take O
away O
the O
melon; O
maybe O
you'll O
have O
a O
bit O
when O
you O
get O
up." O
The O
sighs O
and O
yawns O
of O
the O
old O
woman, O
the O
even O
breathing O
of O
the O
sleeping O
woman, O
the O
half-darkness O
of O
the O
hut, O
and O
the O
sound O
of O
the O
rain O
outside, O
made O
one O
sleepy. O
Yegorushka O
was O
shy O
of O
undressing O
before O
the O
old O
woman. O
He O
only O
took O
off O
his O
boots, O
lay O
down O
and O
covered O
himself O
with O
the O
sheepskin. O
"Is O
the O
little O
lad O
lying O
down?" O
he O
heard O
Panteley O
whisper O
a O
little O
later. O
"Yes," O
answered O
the O
old O
woman O
in O
a O
whisper. O
"The O
terror O
of O
the O
Lord! O
It O
thunders O
and O
thunders, O
and O
there O
is O
no O
end O
to O
it." O
"It O
will O
soon O
be O
over," O
wheezed O
Panteley, O
sitting O
down; O
"it's O
getting O
quieter. O
. O
. O
. O
The O
lads O
have O
gone O
into O
the O
huts, O
and O
two O
have O
stayed O
with O
the O
horses. O
The O
lads O
have. O
. O
. O
. O
They O
can't; O
. O
. O
. O
the O
horses O
would O
be O
taken O
away. O
. O
. O
. O
I'll O
sit O
here O
a O
bit O
and O
then O
go O
and O
take O
my O
turn. O
. O
. O
. O
We O
can't O
leave O
them; O
they O
would O
be O
taken. O
. O
. O
." O
Panteley O
and O
the O
old O
woman O
sat O
side O
by O
side O
at O
Yegorushka's O
feet, O
talking O
in O
hissing O
whispers O
and O
interspersing O
their O
speech O
with O
sighs O
and O
yawns. O
And O
Yegorushka O
could O
not O
get O
warm. O
The O
warm O
heavy O
sheepskin O
lay O
on O
him, O
but O
he O
was O
trembling O
all O
over; O
his O
arms O
and O
legs O
were O
twitching, O
and O
his O
whole O
inside O
was O
shivering. O
. O
. O
. O
He O
undressed O
under O
the O
sheepskin, O
but O
that O
was O
no O
good. O
His O
shivering O
grew O
more O
and O
more O
acute. O
Panteley O
went O
out O
to O
take O
his O
turn O
with O
the O
horses, O
and O
afterwards O
came O
back O
again, O
and O
still O
Yegorushka O
was O
shivering O
all O
over O
and O
could O
not O
get O
to O
sleep. O
Something O
weighed O
upon O
his O
head O
and O
chest O
and O
oppressed O
him, O
and O
he O
did O
not O
know O
what O
it O
was, O
whether O
it O
was O
the O
old O
people O
whispering, O
or O
the O
heavy O
smell O
of O
the O
sheepskin. O
The O
melon O
he O
had O
eaten O
had O
left O
an O
unpleasant O
metallic O
taste O
in O
his O
mouth. O
Moreover O
he O
was O
being O
bitten O
by O
fleas. O
"Grandfather, O
I O
am O
cold," O
he O
said, O
and O
did O
not O
know O
his O
own O
voice. O
"Go O
to O
sleep, O
my O
child, O
go O
to O
sleep," O
sighed O
the O
old O
woman. O
Tit O
came O
up O
to O
the O
bedside O
on O
his O
thin O
little O
legs O
and O
waved O
his O
arms, O
then O
grew O
up O
to O
the O
ceiling O
and O
turned O
into O
a O
windmill. O
. O
. O
. O
Father O
Christopher, O
not O
as O
he O
was O
in O
the O
chaise, O
but O
in O
his O
full O
vestments O
with O
the O
sprinkler O
in O
his O
hand, O
walked O
round O
the O
mill, O
sprinkling O
it O
with O
holy O
water, O
and O
it O
left O
off O
waving. O
Yegorushka, O
knowing O
this O
was O
delirium, O
opened O
his O
eyes. O
"Grandfather," O
he O
called, O
"give O
me O
some O
water." O
No O
one O
answered. O
Yegorushka O
felt O
it O
insufferably O
stifling O
and O
uncomfortable O
lying O
down. O
He O
got O
up, O
dressed, O
and O
went O
out O
of O
the O
hut. O
Morning O
was O
beginning. O
The O
sky O
was O
overcast, O
but O
it O
was O
no O
longer O
raining. O
Shivering O
and O
wrapping O
himself O
in O
his O
wet O
overcoat, O
Yegorushka O
walked O
about O
the O
muddy O
yard O
and O
listened O
to O
the O
silence; O
he O
caught O
sight O
of O
a O
little O
shed O
with O
a O
half-open O
door O
made O
of O
reeds. O
He O
looked O
into O
this O
shed, O
went O
into O
it, O
and O
sat O
down O
in O
a O
dark O
corner O
on O
a O
heap O
of O
dry O
dung. O
There O
was O
a O
tangle O
of O
thoughts O
in O
his O
heavy O
head; O
his O
mouth O
was O
dry O
and O
unpleasant O
from O
the O
metallic O
taste. O
He O
looked O
at O
his O
hat, O
straightened O
the O
peacock's O
feather O
on O
it, O
and O
thought O
how O
he O
had O
gone O
with O
his O
mother O
to O
buy O
the O
hat. O
He O
put O
his O
hand O
into O
his O
pocket O
and O
took O
out O
a O
lump O
of O
brownish O
sticky O
paste. O
How O
had O
that O
paste O
come O
into O
his O
pocket? O
He O
thought O
a O
minute, O
smelt O
it; O
it O
smelt O
of O
honey. O
Aha! O
it O
was O
the O
Jewish O
cake! O
How O
sopped O
it O
was, O
poor O
thing! O
Yegorushka O
examined O
his O
coat. O
It O
was O
a O
little O
grey O
overcoat O
with O
big O
bone O
buttons, O
cut O
in O
the O
shape O
of O
a O
frock-coat. O
At O
home, O
being O
a O
new O
and O
expensive O
article, O
it O
had O
not O
been O
hung O
in O
the O
hall, O
but O
with O
his O
mother's O
dresses O
in O
her O
bedroom; O
he O
was O
only O
allowed O
to O
wear O
it O
on O
holidays. O
Looking O
at O
it, O
Yegorushka O
felt O
sorry O
for O
it. O
He O
thought O
that O
he O
and O
the O
great-coat O
were O
both O
abandoned O
to O
the O
mercy O
of O
destiny; O
he O
thought O
that O
he O
would O
never O
get O
back O
home, O
and O
began O
sobbing O
so O
violently O
that O
he O
almost O
fell O
off O
the O
heap O
of O
dung. O
A O
big O
white O
dog O
with O
woolly O
tufts O
like O
curl-papers O
about O
its O
face, O
sopping O
from O
the O
rain, O
came O
into O
the O
shed O
and O
stared O
with O
curiosity O
at O
Yegorushka. O
It O
seemed O
to O
be O
hesitating O
whether O
to O
bark O
or O
not. O
Deciding O
that O
there O
was O
no O
need O
to O
bark, O
it O
went O
cautiously O
up O
to O
Yegorushka, O
ate O
the O
sticky O
plaster O
and O
went O
out O
again. O
"There O
are O
Varlamov's O
men!" O
someone O
shouted O
in O
the O
street. O
After O
having O
his O
cry O
out, O
Yegorushka O
went O
out O
of O
the O
shed O
and, O
walking O
round O
a O
big O
puddle, O
made O
his O
way O
towards O
the O
street. O
The O
waggons O
were O
standing O
exactly O
opposite O
the O
gateway. O
The O
drenched O
waggoners, O
with O
their O
muddy O
feet, O
were O
sauntering O
beside O
them O
or O
sitting O
on O
the O
shafts, O
as O
listless O
and O
drowsy O
as O
flies O
in O
autumn. O
Yegorushka O
looked O
at O
them O
and O
thought: O
"How O
dreary O
and O
comfortless O
to O
be O
a O
peasant!" O
He O
went O
up O
to O
Panteley O
and O
sat O
down O
beside O
him O
on O
the O
shaft. O
"Grandfather, O
I'm O
cold," O
he O
said, O
shivering O
and O
thrusting O
his O
hands O
up O
his O
sleeves. O
"Never O
mind, O
we O
shall O
soon O
be O
there," O
yawned O
Panteley. O
"Never O
mind, O
you O
will O
get O
warm." O
It O
must O
have O
been O
early O
when O
the O
waggons O
set O
off, O
for O
it O
was O
not O
hot. O
Yegorushka O
lay O
on O
the O
bales O
of O
wool O
and O
shivered O
with O
cold, O
though O
the O
sun O
soon O
came O
out O
and O
dried O
his O
clothes, O
the O
bales, O
and O
the O
earth. O
As O
soon O
as O
he O
closed O
his O
eyes O
he O
saw O
Tit O
and O
the O
windmill O
again. O
Feeling O
a O
sickness O
and O
heaviness O
all O
over, O
he O
did O
his O
utmost O
to O
drive O
away O
these O
images, O
but O
as O
soon O
as O
they O
vanished O
the O
dare-devil O
Dymov, O
with O
red O
eyes O
and O
lifted O
fists, O
rushed O
at O
Yegorushka O
with O
a O
roar, O
or O
there O
was O
the O
sound O
of O
his O
complaint: O
"I O
am O
so O
dreary!" O
Varlamov O
rode O
by O
on O
his O
little O
Cossack O
stallion; O
happy O
Konstantin O
passed, O
with O
a O
smile O
and O
the O
bustard O
in O
his O
arms. O
And O
how O
tedious O
these O
people O
were, O
how O
sickening O
and O
unbearable! O
Once-- O
it O
was O
towards O
evening-- O
he O
raised O
his O
head O
to O
ask O
for O
water. O
The O
waggons O
were O
standing O
on O
a O
big O
bridge O
across O
a O
broad O
river. O
There O
was O
black O
smoke O
below O
over O
the O
river, O
and O
through O
it O
could O
be O
seen O
a O
steamer O
with O
a O
barge O
in O
tow. O
Ahead O
of O
them, O
beyond O
the O
river, O
was O
a O
huge O
mountain O
dotted O
with O
houses O
and O
churches; O
at O
the O
foot O
of O
the O
mountain O
an O
engine O
was O
being O
shunted O
along O
beside O
some O
goods O
trucks. O
Yegorushka O
had O
never O
before O
seen O
steamers, O
nor O
engines, O
nor O
broad O
rivers. O
Glancing O
at O
them O
now, O
he O
was O
not O
alarmed O
or O
surprised; O
there O
was O
not O
even O
a O
look O
of O
anything O
like O
curiosity O
in O
his O
face. O
He O
merely O
felt O
sick, O
and O
made O
haste O
to O
turn O
over O
to O
the O
edge O
of O
the O
bale. O
He O
was O
sick. O
Panteley, O
seeing O
this, O
cleared O
his O
throat O
and O
shook O
his O
head. O
"Our O
little O
lad's O
taken O
ill," O
he O
said. O
"He O
must O
have O
got O
a O
chill O
to O
the O
stomach. O
The O
little O
lad O
must. O
. O
. O
away O
from O
home; O
it's O
a O
bad O
lookout!" O
VIII O
The O
waggons O
stopped O
at O
a O
big O
inn O
for O
merchants, O
not O
far O
from O
the O
quay. O
As O
Yegorushka O
climbed O
down O
from O
the O
waggon O
he O
heard O
a O
very O
familiar O
voice. O
Someone O
was O
helping O
him O
to O
get O
down, O
and O
saying: O
"We O
arrived O
yesterday O
evening. O
. O
. O
. O
We O
have O
been O
expecting O
you O
all O
day. O
We O
meant O
to O
overtake O
you O
yesterday, O
but O
it O
was O
out O
of O
our O
way; O
we O
came O
by O
the O
other O
road. O
I O
say, O
how O
you O
have O
crumpled O
your O
coat! O
You'll O
catch O
it O
from O
your O
uncle!" O
Yegorushka O
looked O
into O
the O
speaker's O
mottled O
face O
and O
remembered O
that O
this O
was O
Deniska. O
"Your O
uncle O
and O
Father O
Christopher O
are O
in O
the O
inn O
now, O
drinking O
tea; O
come O
along!" O
And O
he O
led O
Yegorushka O
to O
a O
big O
two-storied O
building, O
dark O
and O
gloomy O
like O
the O
almshouse O
at O
N. O
After O
going O
across O
the O
entry, O
up O
a O
dark O
staircase O
and O
through O
a O
narrow O
corridor, O
Yegorushka O
and O
Deniska O
reached O
a O
little O
room O
in O
which O
Ivan O
Ivanitch O
and O
Father O
Christopher O
were O
sitting O
at O
the O
tea-table. O
Seeing O
the O
boy, O
both O
the O
old O
men O
showed O
surprise O
and O
pleasure. O
"Aha! O
Yegor O
Ni-ko-la-aitch!" O
chanted O
Father O
Christopher. O
"Mr. O
Lomonosov!" O
"Ah, O
our O
gentleman O
that O
is O
to O
be," O
said O
Kuzmitchov, O
"pleased O
to O
see O
you!" O
Yegorushka O
took O
off O
his O
great-coat, O
kissed O
his O
uncle's O
hand O
and O
Father O
Christopher's, O
and O
sat O
down O
to O
the O
table. O
"Well, O
how O
did O
you O
like O
the O
journey, O
puer O
bone?" O
Father O
Christopher O
pelted O
him O
with O
questions O
as O
he O
poured O
him O
out O
some O
tea, O
with O
his O
radiant O
smile. O
"Sick O
of O
it, O
I've O
no O
doubt? O
God O
save O
us O
all O
from O
having O
to O
travel O
by O
waggon O
or O
with O
oxen. O
You O
go O
on O
and O
on, O
God O
forgive O
us; O
you O
look O
ahead O
and O
the O
steppe O
is O
always O
lying O
stretched O
out O
the O
same O
as O
it O
was-- O
you O
can't O
see O
the O
end O
of O
it! O
It's O
not O
travelling O
but O
regular O
torture. O
Why O
don't O
you O
drink O
your O
tea? O
Drink O
it O
up; O
and O
in O
your O
absence, O
while O
you O
have O
been O
trailing O
along O
with O
the O
waggons, O
we O
have O
settled O
all O
our O
business O
capitally. O
Thank O
God O
we O
have O
sold O
our O
wool O
to O
Tcherepahin, O
and O
no O
one O
could O
wish O
to O
have O
done O
better. O
. O
. O
. O
We O
have O
made O
a O
good O
bargain." O
At O
the O
first O
sight O
of O
his O
own O
people O
Yegorushka O
felt O
an O
overwhelming O
desire O
to O
complain. O
He O
did O
not O
listen O
to O
Father O
Christopher, O
but O
thought O
how O
to O
begin O
and O
what O
exactly O
to O
complain O
of. O
But O
Father O
Christopher's O
voice, O
which O
seemed O
to O
him O
harsh O
and O
unpleasant, O
prevented O
him O
from O
concentrating O
his O
attention O
and O
confused O
his O
thoughts. O
He O
had O
not O
sat O
at O
the O
table O
five O
minutes O
before O
he O
got O
up, O
went O
to O
the O
sofa O
and O
lay O
down. O
"Well, O
well," O
said O
Father O
Christopher O
in O
surprise. O
"What O
about O
your O
tea?" O
Still O
thinking O
what O
to O
complain O
of, O
Yegorushka O
leaned O
his O
head O
against O
the O
wall O
and O
broke O
into O
sobs. O
"Well, O
well!" O
repeated O
Father O
Christopher, O
getting O
up O
and O
going O
to O
the O
sofa. O
"Yegory, O
what O
is O
the O
matter O
with O
you? O
Why O
are O
you O
crying?" O
"I'm O
. O
. O
. O
I'm O
ill," O
Yegorushka O
brought O
out. O
"Ill?" O
said O
Father O
Christopher O
in O
amazement. O
"That's O
not O
the O
right O
thing, O
my O
boy. O
. O
. O
. O
One O
mustn't O
be O
ill O
on O
a O
journey. O
Aie, O
aie, O
what O
are O
you O
thinking O
about, O
boy O
. O
. O
. O
eh?" O
He O
put O
his O
hand O
to O
Yegorushka's O
head, O
touched O
his O
cheek O
and O
said: O
"Yes, O
your O
head's O
feverish. O
. O
. O
. O
You O
must O
have O
caught O
cold O
or O
else O
have O
eaten O
something. O
. O
. O
. O
Pray O
to O
God." O
"Should O
we O
give O
him O
quinine? O
. O
. O
." O
said O
Ivan O
Ivanitch, O
troubled. O
"No; O
he O
ought O
to O
have O
something O
hot. O
. O
. O
. O
Yegory, O
have O
a O
little O
drop O
of O
soup? O
Eh?" O
"I. O
. O
. O
don't O
want O
any," O
said O
Yegorushka. O
"Are O
you O
feeling O
chilly?" O
"I O
was O
chilly O
before, O
but O
now O
. O
. O
. O
now O
I O
am O
hot. O
And O
I O
ache O
all O
over. O
. O
. O
." O
Ivan O
Ivanitch O
went O
up O
to O
the O
sofa, O
touched O
Yegorushka O
on O
the O
head, O
cleared O
his O
throat O
with O
a O
perplexed O
air, O
and O
went O
back O
to O
the O
table. O
"I O
tell O
you O
what, O
you O
undress O
and O
go O
to O
bed," O
said O
Father O
Christopher. O
"What O
you O
want O
is O
sleep O
now." O
He O
helped O
Yegorushka O
to O
undress, O
gave O
him O
a O
pillow O
and O
covered O
him O
with O
a O
quilt, O
and O
over O
that O
Ivan O
Ivanitch's O
great-coat. O
Then O
he O
walked O
away O
on O
tiptoe O
and O
sat O
down O
to O
the O
table. O
Yegorushka O
shut O
his O
eyes, O
and O
at O
once O
it O
seemed O
to O
him O
that O
he O
was O
not O
in O
the O
hotel O
room, O
but O
on O
the O
highroad O
beside O
the O
camp O
fire. O
Emelyan O
waved O
his O
hands, O
and O
Dymov O
with O
red O
eyes O
lay O
on O
his O
stomach O
and O
looked O
mockingly O
at O
Yegorushka. O
"Beat O
him, O
beat O
him!" O
shouted O
Yegorushka. O
"He O
is O
delirious," O
said O
Father O
Christopher O
in O
an O
undertone. O
"It's O
a O
nuisance!" O
sighed O
Ivan O
Ivanitch. O
"He O
must O
be O
rubbed O
with O
oil O
and O
vinegar. O
Please O
God, O
he O
will O
be O
better O
to-morrow." O
To O
be O
rid O
of O
bad O
dreams, O
Yegorushka O
opened O
his O
eyes O
and O
began O
looking O
towards O
the O
fire. O
Father O
Christopher O
and O
Ivan O
Ivanitch O
had O
now O
finished O
their O
tea O
and O
were O
talking O
in O
a O
whisper. O
The O
first O
was O
smiling O
with O
delight, O
and O
evidently O
could O
not O
forget O
that O
he O
had O
made O
a O
good O
bargain O
over O
his O
wool; O
what O
delighted O
him O
was O
not O
so O
much O
the O
actual O
profit O
he O
had O
made O
as O
the O
thought O
that O
on O
getting O
home O
he O
would O
gather O
round O
him O
his O
big O
family, O
wink O
slyly O
and O
go O
off O
into O
a O
chuckle; O
at O
first O
he O
would O
deceive O
them O
all, O
and O
say O
that O
he O
had O
sold O
the O
wool O
at O
a O
price O
below O
its O
value, O
then O
he O
would O
give O
his O
son-in-law, O
Mihail, O
a O
fat O
pocket-book O
and O
say: O
"Well, O
take O
it! O
that's O
the O
way O
to O
do O
business!" O
Kuzmitchov O
did O
not O
seem O
pleased; O
his O
face O
expressed, O
as O
before, O
a O
business-like O
reserve O
and O
anxiety. O
"If O
I O
could O
have O
known O
that O
Tcherepahin O
would O
give O
such O
a O
price," O
he O
said O
in O
a O
low O
voice, O
"I O
wouldn't O
have O
sold O
Makarov O
those O
five O
tons O
at O
home. O
It O
is O
vexatious! O
But O
who O
could O
have O
told O
that O
the O
price O
had O
gone O
up O
here?" O
A O
man O
in O
a O
white O
shirt O
cleared O
away O
the O
samovar O
and O
lighted O
the O
little O
lamp O
before O
the O
ikon O
in O
the O
corner. O
Father O
Christopher O
whispered O
something O
in O
his O
ear; O
the O
man O
looked, O
made O
a O
serious O
face O
like O
a O
conspirator, O
as O
though O
to O
say, O
"I O
understand," O
went O
out, O
and O
returned O
a O
little O
while O
afterwards O
and O
put O
something O
under O
the O
sofa. O
Ivan O
Ivanitch O
made O
himself O
a O
bed O
on O
the O
floor, O
yawned O
several O
times, O
said O
his O
prayers O
lazily, O
and O
lay O
down. O
"I O
think O
of O
going O
to O
the O
cathedral O
to-morrow," O
said O
Father O
Christopher. O
"I O
know O
the O
sacristan O
there. O
I O
ought O
to O
go O
and O
see O
the O
bishop O
after O
mass, O
but O
they O
say O
he O
is O
ill." O
He O
yawned O
and O
put O
out O
the O
lamp. O
Now O
there O
was O
no O
light O
in O
the O
room O
but O
the O
little O
lamp O
before O
the O
ikon. O
"They O
say O
he O
can't O
receive O
visitors," O
Father O
Christopher O
went O
on, O
undressing. O
"So O
I O
shall O
go O
away O
without O
seeing O
him." O
He O
took O
off O
his O
full O
coat, O
and O
Yegorushka O
saw O
Robinson O
Crusoe O
reappear. O
Robinson O
stirred O
something O
in O
a O
saucer, O
went O
up O
to O
Yegorushka O
and O
whispered: O
"Lomonosov, O
are O
you O
asleep? O
Sit O
up; O
I'm O
going O
to O
rub O
you O
with O
oil O
and O
vinegar. O
It's O
a O
good O
thing, O
only O
you O
must O
say O
a O
prayer." O
Yegorushka O
roused O
himself O
quickly O
and O
sat O
up. O
Father O
Christopher O
pulled O
down O
the O
boy's O
shirt, O
and O
shrinking O
and O
breathing O
jerkily, O
as O
though O
he O
were O
being O
tickled O
himself, O
began O
rubbing O
Yegorushka's O
chest. O
"In O
the O
name O
of O
the O
Father, O
the O
Son, O
and O
the O
Holy O
Ghost," O
he O
whispered, O
"lie O
with O
your O
back O
upwards-- O
that's O
it. O
. O
. O
. O
You'll O
be O
all O
right O
to-morrow, O
but O
don't O
do O
it O
again. O
. O
. O
. O
You O
are O
as O
hot O
as O
fire. O
I O
suppose O
you O
were O
on O
the O
road O
in O
the O
storm." O
"Yes." O
"You O
might O
well O
fall O
ill! O
In O
the O
name O
of O
the O
Father, O
the O
Son, O
and O
the O
Holy O
Ghost, O
. O
. O
. O
you O
might O
well O
fall O
ill!" O
After O
rubbing O
Yegorushka, O
Father O
Christopher O
put O
on O
his O
shirt O
again, O
covered O
him, O
made O
the O
sign O
of O
the O
cross O
over O
him, O
and O
walked O
away. O
Then O
Yegorushka O
saw O
him O
saying O
his O
prayers. O
Probably O
the O
old O
man O
knew O
a O
great O
many O
prayers O
by O
heart, O
for O
he O
stood O
a O
long O
time O
before O
the O
ikon O
murmuring. O
After O
saying O
his O
prayers O
he O
made O
the O
sign O
of O
the O
cross O
over O
the O
window, O
the O
door, O
Yegorushka, O
and O
Ivan O
Ivanitch, O
lay O
down O
on O
the O
little O
sofa O
without O
a O
pillow, O
and O
covered O
himself O
with O
his O
full O
coat. O
A O
clock O
in O
the O
corridor O
struck O
ten. O
Yegorushka O
thought O
how O
long O
a O
time O
it O
would O
be O
before O
morning; O
feeling O
miserable, O
he O
pressed O
his O
forehead O
against O
the O
back O
of O
the O
sofa O
and O
left O
off O
trying O
to O
get O
rid O
of O
the O
oppressive O
misty O
dreams. O
But O
morning O
came O
much O
sooner O
than O
he O
expected. O
It O
seemed O
to O
him O
that O
he O
had O
not O
been O
lying O
long O
with O
his O
head O
pressed O
to O
the O
back O
of O
the O
sofa, O
but O
when O
he O
opened O
his O
eyes O
slanting O
rays O
of O
sunlight O
were O
already O
shining O
on O
the O
floor O
through O
the O
two O
windows O
of O
the O
little O
hotel O
room. O
Father O
Christopher O
and O
Ivan O
Ivanitch O
were O
not O
in O
the O
room. O
The O
room O
had O
been O
tidied; O
it O
was O
bright, O
snug, O
and O
smelt O
of O
Father O
Christopher, O
who O
always O
smelt O
of O
cypress O
and O
dried O
cornflowers O
(at O
home O
he O
used O
to O
make O
the O
holy-water O
sprinklers O
and O
decorations O
for O
the O
ikonstands O
out O
of O
cornflowers, O
and O
so O
he O
was O
saturated O
with O
the O
smell O
of O
them). O
Yegorushka O
looked O
at O
the O
pillow, O
at O
the O
slanting O
sunbeams, O
at O
his O
boots, O
which O
had O
been O
cleaned O
and O
were O
standing O
side O
by O
side O
near O
the O
sofa, O
and O
laughed. O
It O
seemed O
strange O
to O
him O
that O
he O
was O
not O
on O
the O
bales O
of O
wool, O
that O
everything O
was O
dry O
around O
him, O
and O
that O
there O
was O
no O
thunder O
and O
lightning O
on O
the O
ceiling. O
He O
jumped O
off O
the O
sofa O
and O
began O
dressing. O
He O
felt O
splendid; O
nothing O
was O
left O
of O
his O
yesterday's O
illness O
but O
a O
slight O
weakness O
in O
his O
legs O
and O
neck. O
So O
the O
vinegar O
and O
oil O
had O
done O
good. O
He O
remembered O
the O
steamer, O
the O
railway O
engine, O
and O
the O
broad O
river, O
which O
he O
had O
dimly O
seen O
the O
day O
before, O
and O
now O
he O
made O
haste O
to O
dress, O
to O
run O
to O
the O
quay O
and O
have O
a O
look O
at O
them. O
When O
he O
had O
washed O
and O
was O
putting O
on O
his O
red O
shirt, O
the O
latch O
of O
the O
door O
clicked, O
and O
Father O
Christopher O
appeared O
in O
the O
doorway, O
wearing O
his O
top-hat O
and O
a O
brown O
silk O
cassock O
over O
his O
canvas O
coat O
and O
carrying O
his O
staff O
in O
his O
hand. O
Smiling O
and O
radiant O
(old O
men O
are O
always O
radiant O
when O
they O
come O
back O
from O
church), O
he O
put O
a O
roll O
of O
holy O
bread O
and O
a O
parcel O
of O
some O
sort O
on O
the O
table, O
prayed O
before O
the O
ikon, O
and O
said: O
"God O
has O
sent O
us O
blessings-- O
well, O
how O
are O
you?" O
"Quite O
well O
now," O
answered O
Yegorushka, O
kissing O
his O
hand. O
"Thank O
God. O
. O
. O
. O
I O
have O
come O
from O
mass. O
I've O
been O
to O
see O
a O
sacristan O
I O
know. O
He O
invited O
me O
to O
breakfast O
with O
him, O
but O
I O
didn't O
go. O
I O
don't O
like O
visiting O
people O
too O
early, O
God O
bless O
them!" O
He O
took O
off O
his O
cassock, O
stroked O
himself O
on O
the O
chest, O
and O
without O
haste O
undid O
the O
parcel. O
Yegorushka O
saw O
a O
little O
tin O
of O
caviare, O
a O
piece O
of O
dry O
sturgeon, O
and O
a O
French O
loaf. O
"See; O
I O
passed O
a O
fish-shop O
and O
brought O
this," O
said O
Father O
Christopher. O
"There O
is O
no O
need O
to O
indulge O
in O
luxuries O
on O
an O
ordinary O
weekday; O
but O
I O
thought, O
I've O
an O
invalid O
at O
home, O
so O
it O
is O
excusable. O
And O
the O
caviare O
is O
good, O
real O
sturgeon. O
. O
. O
." O
The O
man O
in O
the O
white O
shirt O
brought O
in O
the O
samovar O
and O
a O
tray O
with O
tea-things. O
"Eat O
some," O
said O
Father O
Christopher, O
spreading O
the O
caviare O
on O
a O
slice O
of O
bread O
and O
handing O
it O
to O
Yegorushka. O
"Eat O
now O
and O
enjoy O
yourself, O
but O
the O
time O
will O
soon O
come O
for O
you O
to O
be O
studying. O
Mind O
you O
study O
with O
attention O
and O
application, O
so O
that O
good O
may O
come O
of O
it. O
What O
you O
have O
to O
learn O
by O
heart, O
learn O
by O
heart, O
but O
when O
you O
have O
to O
tell O
the O
inner O
sense O
in O
your O
own O
words, O
without O
regard O
to O
the O
outer O
form, O
then O
say O
it O
in O
your O
own O
words. O
And O
try O
to O
master O
all O
subjects. O
One O
man O
knows O
mathematics O
excellently, O
but O
has O
never O
heard O
of O
Pyotr O
Mogila; O
another O
knows O
about O
Pyotr O
Mogila, O
but O
cannot O
explain O
about O
the O
moon. O
But O
you O
study O
so O
as O
to O
understand O
everything. O
Study O
Latin, O
French, O
German, O
. O
. O
. O
geography, O
of O
course, O
history, O
theology, O
philosophy, O
mathematics, O
. O
. O
. O
and O
when O
you O
have O
mastered O
everything, O
not O
with O
haste O
but O
with O
prayer O
and O
with O
zeal, O
then O
go O
into O
the O
service. O
When O
you O
know O
everything O
it O
will O
be O
easy O
for O
you O
in O
any O
line O
of O
life. O
. O
. O
. O
You O
study O
and O
strive O
for O
the O
divine O
blessing, O
and O
God O
will O
show O
you O
what O
to O
be. O
Whether O
a O
doctor, O
a O
judge O
or O
an O
engineer. O
. O
. O
." O
Father O
Christopher O
spread O
a O
little O
caviare O
on O
a O
piece O
of O
bread, O
put O
it O
in O
his O
mouth O
and O
said: O
"The O
Apostle O
Paul O
says: O
'Do O
not O
apply O
yourself O
to O
strange O
and O
diverse O
studies.' O
Of O
course, O
if O
it O
is O
black O
magic, O
unlawful O
arts, O
or O
calling O
up O
spirits O
from O
the O
other O
world, O
like O
Saul, O
or O
studying O
subjects O
that O
can O
be O
of O
no O
use O
to O
yourself O
or O
others, O
better O
not O
learn O
them. O
You O
must O
undertake O
only O
what O
God O
has O
blessed. O
Take O
example O
. O
. O
. O
the O
Holy O
Apostles O
spoke O
in O
all O
languages, O
so O
you O
study O
languages. O
Basil O
the O
Great O
studied O
mathematics O
and O
philosophy-- O
so O
you O
study O
them; O
St. O
Nestor O
wrote O
history-- O
so O
you O
study O
and O
write O
history. O
Take O
example O
from O
the O
saints." O
Father O
Christopher O
sipped O
the O
tea O
from O
his O
saucer, O
wiped O
his O
moustaches, O
and O
shook O
his O
head. O
"Good!" O
he O
said. O
"I O
was O
educated O
in O
the O
old-fashioned O
way; O
I O
have O
forgotten O
a O
great O
deal O
by O
now, O
but O
still O
I O
live O
differently O
from O
other O
people. O
Indeed, O
there O
is O
no O
comparison. O
For O
instance, O
in O
company O
at O
a O
dinner, O
or O
at O
an O
assembly, O
one O
says O
something O
in O
Latin, O
or O
makes O
some O
allusion O
from O
history O
or O
philosophy, O
and O
it O
pleases O
people, O
and O
it O
pleases O
me O
myself. O
. O
. O
. O
Or O
when O
the O
circuit O
court O
comes O
and O
one O
has O
to O
take O
the O
oath, O
all O
the O
other O
priests O
are O
shy, O
but O
I O
am O
quite O
at O
home O
with O
the O
judges, O
the O
prosecutors, O
and O
the O
lawyers. O
I O
talk O
intellectually, O
drink O
a O
cup O
of O
tea O
with O
them, O
laugh, O
ask O
them O
what O
I O
don't O
know, O
. O
. O
. O
and O
they O
like O
it. O
So O
that's O
how O
it O
is, O
my O
boy. O
Learning O
is O
light O
and O
ignorance O
is O
darkness. O
Study! O
It's O
hard, O
of O
course; O
nowadays O
study O
is O
expensive. O
. O
. O
. O
Your O
mother O
is O
a O
widow; O
she O
lives O
on O
her O
pension, O
but O
there, O
of O
course O
. O
. O
." O
Father O
Christopher O
glanced O
apprehensively O
towards O
the O
door, O
and O
went O
on O
in O
a O
whisper: O
"Ivan O
Ivanitch O
will O
assist. O
He O
won't O
desert O
you. O
He O
has O
no O
children O
of O
his O
own, O
and O
he O
will O
help O
you. O
Don't O
be O
uneasy." O
He O
looked O
grave, O
and O
whispered O
still O
more O
softly: O
"Only O
mind, O
Yegory, O
don't O
forget O
your O
mother O
and O
Ivan O
Ivanitch, O
God O
preserve O
you O
from O
it. O
The O
commandment O
bids O
you O
honour O
your O
mother, O
and O
Ivan O
Ivanitch O
is O
your O
benefactor O
and O
takes O
the O
place O
of O
a O
father O
to O
you. O
If O
you O
become O
learned, O
God O
forbid O
you O
should O
be O
impatient O
and O
scornful O
with O
people O
because O
they O
are O
not O
so O
clever O
as O
you, O
then O
woe, O
woe O
to O
you!" O
Father O
Christopher O
raised O
his O
hand O
and O
repeated O
in O
a O
thin O
voice: O
"Woe O
to O
you! O
Woe O
to O
you!" O
Father O
Christopher's O
tongue O
was O
loosened, O
and O
he O
was, O
as O
they O
say, O
warming O
to O
his O
subject; O
he O
would O
not O
have O
finished O
till O
dinnertime O
but O
the O
door O
opened O
and O
Ivan O
Ivanitch O
walked O
in. O
He O
said O
good-morning O
hurriedly, O
sat O
down O
to O
the O
table, O
and O
began O
rapidly O
swallowing O
his O
tea. O
"Well, O
I O
have O
settled O
all O
our O
business," O
he O
said. O
"We O
might O
have O
gone O
home O
to-day, O
but O
we O
have O
still O
to O
think O
about O
Yegor. O
We O
must O
arrange O
for O
him. O
My O
sister O
told O
me O
that O
Nastasya O
Petrovna, O
a O
friend O
of O
hers, O
lives O
somewhere O
here, O
so O
perhaps O
she O
will O
take O
him O
in O
as O
a O
boarder." O
He O
rummaged O
in O
his O
pocket-book, O
found O
a O
crumpled O
note O
and O
read: O
"'Little O
Lower O
Street: O
Nastasya O
Petrovna O
Toskunov, O
living O
in O
a O
house O
of O
her O
own.' O
We O
must O
go O
at O
once O
and O
try O
to O
find O
her. O
It's O
a O
nuisance!" O
Soon O
after O
breakfast O
Ivan O
Ivanitch O
and O
Yegorushka O
left O
the O
inn. O
"It's O
a O
nuisance," O
muttered O
his O
uncle. O
"You O
are O
sticking O
to O
me O
like O
a O
burr. O
You O
and O
your O
mother O
want O
education O
and O
gentlemanly O
breeding O
and O
I O
have O
nothing O
but O
worry O
with O
you O
both. O
. O
. O
." O
When O
they O
crossed O
the O
yard, O
the O
waggons O
and O
the O
drivers O
were O
not O
there. O
They O
had O
all O
gone O
off O
to O
the O
quay O
early O
in O
the O
morning. O
In O
a O
far-off O
dark O
corner O
of O
the O
yard O
stood O
the O
chaise. O
"Good-bye, O
chaise!" O
thought O
Yegorushka. O
At O
first O
they O
had O
to O
go O
a O
long O
way O
uphill O
by O
a O
broad O
street, O
then O
they O
had O
to O
cross O
a O
big O
marketplace; O
here O
Ivan O
Ivanitch O
asked O
a O
policeman O
for O
Little O
Lower O
Street. O
"I O
say," O
said O
the O
policeman, O
with O
a O
grin, O
"it's O
a O
long O
way O
off, O
out O
that O
way O
towards O
the O
town O
grazing O
ground." O
They O
met O
several O
cabs O
but O
Ivan O
Ivanitch O
only O
permitted O
himself O
such O
a O
weakness O
as O
taking O
a O
cab O
in O
exceptional O
cases O
and O
on O
great O
holidays. O
Yegorushka O
and O
he O
walked O
for O
a O
long O
while O
through O
paved O
streets, O
then O
along O
streets O
where O
there O
were O
only O
wooden O
planks O
at O
the O
sides O
and O
no O
pavements, O
and O
in O
the O
end O
got O
to O
streets O
where O
there O
were O
neither O
planks O
nor O
pavements. O
When O
their O
legs O
and O
their O
tongues O
had O
brought O
them O
to O
Little O
Lower O
Street O
they O
were O
both O
red O
in O
the O
face, O
and O
taking O
off O
their O
hats, O
wiped O
away O
the O
perspiration. O
"Tell O
me, O
please," O
said O
Ivan O
Ivanitch, O
addressing O
an O
old O
man O
sitting O
on O
a O
little O
bench O
by O
a O
gate, O
"where O
is O
Nastasya O
Petrovna O
Toskunov's O
house?" O
"There O
is O
no O
one O
called O
Toskunov O
here," O
said O
the O
old O
man, O
after O
pondering O
a O
moment. O
"Perhaps O
it's O
Timoshenko O
you O
want." O
"No, O
Toskunov. O
. O
. O
." O
"Excuse O
me, O
there's O
no O
one O
called O
Toskunov. O
. O
. O
." O
Ivan O
Ivanitch O
shrugged O
his O
shoulders O
and O
trudged O
on O
farther. O
"You O
needn't O
look," O
the O
old O
man O
called O
after O
them. O
"I O
tell O
you O
there O
isn't, O
and O
there O
isn't." O
"Listen, O
auntie," O
said O
Ivan O
Ivanitch, O
addressing O
an O
old O
woman O
who O
was O
sitting O
at O
a O
corner O
with O
a O
tray O
of O
pears O
and O
sunflower O
seeds, O
"where O
is O
Nastasya O
Petrovna O
Toskunov's O
house?" O
The O
old O
woman O
looked O
at O
him O
with O
surprise O
and O
laughed. O
"Why, O
Nastasya O
Petrovna O
live O
in O
her O
own O
house O
now!" O
she O
cried. O
"Lord! O
it O
is O
eight O
years O
since O
she O
married O
her O
daughter O
and O
gave O
up O
the O
house O
to O
her O
son-in-law! O
It's O
her O
son-in-law O
lives O
there O
now." O
And O
her O
eyes O
expressed: O
"How O
is O
it O
you O
didn't O
know O
a O
simple O
thing O
like O
that, O
you O
fools?" O
"And O
where O
does O
she O
live O
now?" O
Ivan O
Ivanitch O
asked. O
"Oh, O
Lord!" O
cried O
the O
old O
woman, O
flinging O
up O
her O
hands O
in O
surprise. O
"She O
moved O
ever O
so O
long O
ago! O
It's O
eight O
years O
since O
she O
gave O
up O
her O
house O
to O
her O
son-in-law! O
Upon O
my O
word!" O
She O
probably O
expected O
Ivan O
Ivanitch O
to O
be O
surprised, O
too, O
and O
to O
exclaim: O
"You O
don't O
say O
so," O
but O
Ivan O
Ivanitch O
asked O
very O
calmly: O
"Where O
does O
she O
live O
now?" O
The O
old O
woman O
tucked O
up O
her O
sleeves O
and, O
stretching O
out O
her O
bare O
arm O
to O
point, O
shouted O
in O
a O
shrill O
piercing O
voice: O
"Go O
straight O
on, O
straight O
on, O
straight O
on. O
You O
will O
pass O
a O
little O
red O
house, O
then O
you O
will O
see O
a O
little O
alley O
on O
your O
left. O
Turn O
down O
that O
little O
alley, O
and O
it O
will O
be O
the O
third O
gate O
on O
the O
right. O
. O
. O
." O
Ivan O
Ivanitch O
and O
Yegorushka O
reached O
the O
little O
red O
house, O
turned O
to O
the O
left O
down O
the O
little O
alley, O
and O
made O
for O
the O
third O
gate O
on O
the O
right. O
On O
both O
sides O
of O
this O
very O
old O
grey O
gate O
there O
was O
a O
grey O
fence O
with O
big O
gaps O
in O
it. O
The O
first O
part O
of O
the O
fence O
was O
tilting O
forwards O
and O
threatened O
to O
fall, O
while O
on O
the O
left O
of O
the O
gate O
it O
sloped O
backwards O
towards O
the O
yard. O
The O
gate O
itself O
stood O
upright O
and O
seemed O
to O
be O
still O
undecided O
which O
would O
suit O
it O
best O
--to O
fall O
forwards O
or O
backwards. O
Ivan O
Ivanitch O
opened O
the O
little O
gate O
at O
the O
side, O
and O
he O
and O
Yegorushka O
saw O
a O
big O
yard O
overgrown O
with O
weeds O
and O
burdocks. O
A O
hundred O
paces O
from O
the O
gate O
stood O
a O
little O
house O
with O
a O
red O
roof O
and O
green O
shutters. O
A O
stout O
woman O
with O
her O
sleeves O
tucked O
up O
and O
her O
apron O
held O
out O
was O
standing O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
yard, O
scattering O
something O
on O
the O
ground O
and O
shouting O
in O
a O
voice O
as O
shrill O
as O
that O
of O
the O
woman O
selling O
fruit: O
"Chick! O
. O
. O
. O
Chick! O
. O
. O
. O
Chick!" O
Behind O
her O
sat O
a O
red O
dog O
with O
pointed O
ears. O
Seeing O
the O
strangers, O
he O
ran O
to O
the O
little O
gate O
and O
broke O
into O
a O
tenor O
bark O
(all O
red O
dogs O
have O
a O
tenor O
bark). O
"Whom O
do O
you O
want?" O
asked O
the O
woman, O
putting O
up O
her O
hand O
to O
shade O
her O
eyes O
from O
the O
sun. O
"Good-morning!" O
Ivan O
Ivanitch O
shouted, O
too, O
waving O
off O
the O
red O
dog O
with O
his O
stick. O
"Tell O
me, O
please, O
does O
Nastasya O
Petrovna O
Toskunov O
live O
here?" O
"Yes! O
But O
what O
do O
you O
want O
with O
her?" O
"Perhaps O
you O
are O
Nastasya O
Petrovna?" O
"Well, O
yes, O
I O
am!" O
"Very O
pleased O
to O
see O
you. O
. O
. O
. O
You O
see, O
your O
old O
friend O
Olga O
Ivanovna O
Knyasev O
sends O
her O
love O
to O
you. O
This O
is O
her O
little O
son. O
And O
I, O
perhaps O
you O
remember, O
am O
her O
brother O
Ivan O
Ivanitch. O
. O
. O
. O
You O
are O
one O
of O
us O
from O
N.. O
. O
. O
You O
were O
born O
among O
us O
and O
married O
there. O
. O
. O
." O
A O
silence O
followed. O
The O
stout O
woman O
stared O
blankly O
at O
Ivan O
Ivanitch, O
as O
though O
not O
believing O
or O
not O
understanding O
him, O
then O
she O
flushed O
all O
over, O
and O
flung O
up O
her O
hands; O
the O
oats O
were O
scattered O
out O
of O
her O
apron O
and O
tears O
spurted O
from O
her O
eyes. O
"Olga O
Ivanovna!" O
she O
screamed, O
breathless O
with O
excitement. O
"My O
own O
darling! O
Ah, O
holy O
saints, O
why O
am O
I O
standing O
here O
like O
a O
fool? O
My O
pretty O
little O
angel. O
. O
. O
." O
She O
embraced O
Yegorushka, O
wetted O
his O
face O
with O
her O
tears, O
and O
broke O
down O
completely. O
"Heavens!" O
she O
said, O
wringing O
her O
hands, O
"Olga's O
little O
boy! O
How O
delightful! O
He O
is O
his O
mother O
all O
over! O
The O
image O
of O
his O
mother! O
But O
why O
are O
you O
standing O
in O
the O
yard? O
Come O
indoors." O
Crying, O
gasping O
for O
breath O
and O
talking O
as O
she O
went, O
she O
hurried O
towards O
the O
house. O
Her O
visitors O
trudged O
after O
her. O
"The O
room O
has O
not O
been O
done O
yet," O
she O
said, O
ushering O
the O
visitors O
into O
a O
stuffy O
little O
drawing-room O
adorned O
with O
many O
ikons O
and O
pots O
of O
flowers. O
"Oh, O
Mother O
of O
God! O
Vassilisa, O
go O
and O
open O
the O
shutters O
anyway! O
My O
little O
angel! O
My O
little O
beauty! O
I O
did O
not O
know O
that O
Olitchka O
had O
a O
boy O
like O
that!" O
When O
she O
had O
calmed O
down O
and O
got O
over O
her O
first O
surprise O
Ivan O
Ivanitch O
asked O
to O
speak O
to O
her O
alone. O
Yegorushka O
went O
into O
another O
room; O
there O
was O
a O
sewing-machine; O
in O
the O
window O
was O
a O
cage O
with O
a O
starling O
in O
it, O
and O
there O
were O
as O
many O
ikons O
and O
flowers O
as O
in O
the O
drawing-room. O
Near O
the O
machine O
stood O
a O
little O
girl O
with O
a O
sunburnt O
face O
and O
chubby O
cheeks O
like O
Tit's, O
and O
a O
clean O
cotton O
dress. O
She O
stared O
at O
Yegorushka O
without O
blinking, O
and O
apparently O
felt O
very O
awkward. O
Yegorushka O
looked O
at O
her O
and O
after O
a O
pause O
asked: O
"What's O
your O
name?" O
The O
little O
girl O
moved O
her O
lips, O
looked O
as O
if O
she O
were O
going O
to O
cry, O
and O
answered O
softly: O
"Atka. O
. O
. O
." O
This O
meant O
Katka. O
"He O
will O
live O
with O
you," O
Ivan O
Ivanitch O
was O
whispering O
in O
the O
drawing-room, O
"if O
you O
will O
be O
so O
kind, O
and O
we O
will O
pay O
ten O
roubles O
a O
month O
for O
his O
keep. O
He O
is O
not O
a O
spoilt O
boy; O
he O
is O
quiet. O
. O
. O
." O
"I O
really O
don't O
know O
what O
to O
say, O
Ivan O
Ivanitch!" O
Nastasya O
Petrovna O
sighed O
tearfully. O
"Ten O
roubles O
a O
month O
is O
very O
good, O
but O
it O
is O
a O
dreadful O
thing O
to O
take O
another O
person's O
child! O
He O
may O
fall O
ill O
or O
something. O
. O
. O
." O
When O
Yegorushka O
was O
summoned O
back O
to O
the O
drawing-room O
Ivan O
Ivanitch O
was O
standing O
with O
his O
hat O
in O
his O
hands, O
saying O
good-bye. O
"Well, O
let O
him O
stay O
with O
you O
now, O
then," O
he O
said. O
"Good-bye! O
You O
stay, O
Yegor!" O
he O
said, O
addressing O
his O
nephew. O
"Don't O
be O
troublesome; O
mind O
you O
obey O
Nastasya O
Petrovna. O
. O
. O
. O
Good-bye; O
I O
am O
coming O
again O
to-morrow." O
And O
he O
went O
away. O
Nastasya O
once O
more O
embraced O
Yegorushka, O
called O
him O
a O
little O
angel, O
and O
with O
a O
tear-stained O
face O
began O
preparing O
for O
dinner. O
Three O
minutes O
later O
Yegorushka O
was O
sitting O
beside O
her, O
answering O
her O
endless O
questions O
and O
eating O
hot O
savoury O
cabbage O
soup. O
In O
the O
evening O
he O
sat O
again O
at O
the O
same O
table O
and, O
resting O
his O
head O
on O
his O
hand, O
listened O
to O
Nastasya O
Petrovna. O
Alternately O
laughing O
and O
crying, O
she O
talked O
of O
his O
mother's O
young O
days, O
her O
own O
marriage, O
her O
children. O
. O
. O
. O
A O
cricket O
chirruped O
in O
the O
stove, O
and O
there O
was O
a O
faint O
humming O
from O
the O
burner O
of O
the O
lamp. O
Nastasya O
Petrovna O
talked O
in O
a O
low O
voice, O
and O
was O
continually O
dropping O
her O
thimble O
in O
her O
excitement; O
and O
Katka O
her O
granddaughter, O
crawled O
under O
the O
table O
after O
it O
and O
each O
time O
sat O
a O
long O
while O
under O
the O
table, O
probably O
examining O
Yegorushka's O
feet; O
and O
Yegorushka O
listened, O
half O
dozing O
and O
looking O
at O
the O
old O
woman's O
face, O
her O
wart O
with O
hairs O
on O
it, O
and O
the O
stains O
of O
tears, O
and O
he O
felt O
sad, O
very O
sad. O
He O
was O
put O
to O
sleep O
on O
a O
chest O
and O
told O
that O
if O
he O
were O
hungry O
in O
the O
night O
he O
must O
go O
out O
into O
the O
little O
passage O
and O
take O
some O
chicken, O
put O
there O
under O
a O
plate O
in O
the O
window. O
Next O
morning O
Ivan O
Ivanitch O
and O
Father O
Christopher O
came O
to O
say O
good-bye. O
Nastasya O
Petrovna O
was O
delighted O
to O
see O
them, O
and O
was O
about O
to O
set O
the O
samovar; O
but O
Ivan O
Ivanitch, O
who O
was O
in O
a O
great O
hurry, O
waved O
his O
hands O
and O
said: O
"We O
have O
no O
time O
for O
tea! O
We O
are O
just O
setting O
off." O
Before O
parting O
they O
all O
sat O
down O
and O
were O
silent O
for O
a O
minute. O
Nastasya O
Petrovna O
heaved O
a O
deep O
sigh O
and O
looked O
towards O
the O
ikon O
with O
tear-stained O
eyes. O
"Well," O
began O
Ivan O
Ivanitch, O
getting O
up, O
"so O
you O
will O
stay. O
. O
. O
." O
All O
at O
once O
the O
look O
of O
business-like O
reserve O
vanished O
from O
his O
face; O
he O
flushed O
a O
little O
and O
said O
with O
a O
mournful O
smile: O
"Mind O
you O
work O
hard. O
. O
. O
. O
Don't O
forget O
your O
mother, O
and O
obey O
Nastasya O
Petrovna. O
. O
. O
. O
If O
you O
are O
diligent O
at O
school, O
Yegor, O
I'll O
stand O
by O
you." O
He O
took O
his O
purse O
out O
of O
his O
pocket, O
turned O
his O
back O
to O
Yegorushka, O
fumbled O
for O
a O
long O
time O
among O
the O
smaller O
coins, O
and, O
finding O
a O
ten-kopeck O
piece, O
gave O
it O
to O
Yegorushka. O
Father O
Christopher, O
without O
haste, O
blessed O
Yegorushka. O
"In O
the O
name O
of O
the O
Father, O
the O
Son, O
and O
the O
Holy O
Ghost. O
. O
. O
. O
Study," O
he O
said. O
"Work O
hard, O
my O
lad. O
If O
I O
die, O
remember O
me O
in O
your O
prayers. O
Here O
is O
a O
ten-kopeck O
piece O
from O
me, O
too. O
. O
. O
." O
Yegorushka O
kissed O
his O
hand, O
and O
shed O
tears; O
something O
whispered O
in O
his O
heart O
that O
he O
would O
never O
see O
the O
old O
man O
again. O
"I O
have O
applied O
at O
the O
high O
school O
already," O
said O
Ivan O
Ivanitch O
in O
a O
voice O
as O
though O
there O
were O
a O
corpse O
in O
the O
room. O
"You O
will O
take O
him O
for O
the O
entrance O
examination O
on O
the O
seventh O
of O
August. O
. O
. O
. O
Well, O
good-bye; O
God O
bless O
you, O
good-bye, O
Yegor!" O
"You O
might O
at O
least O
have O
had O
a O
cup O
of O
tea," O
wailed O
Nastasya O
Petrovna. O
Through O
the O
tears O
that O
filled O
his O
eyes O
Yegorushka O
could O
not O
see O
his O
uncle O
and O
Father O
Christopher O
go O
out. O
He O
rushed O
to O
the O
window, O
but O
they O
were O
not O
in O
the O
yard, O
and O
the O
red O
dog, O
who O
had O
just O
been O
barking, O
was O
running O
back O
from O
the O
gate O
with O
the O
air O
of O
having O
done O
his O
duty. O
When O
Yegorushka O
ran O
out O
of O
the O
gate O
Ivan O
Ivanitch O
and O
Father O
Christopher, O
the O
former O
waving O
his O
stick O
with O
the O
crook, O
the O
latter O
his O
staff, O
were O
just O
turning O
the O
corner. O
Yegorushka O
felt O
that O
with O
these O
people O
all O
that O
he O
had O
known O
till O
then O
had O
vanished O
from O
him O
for O
ever. O
He O
sank O
helplessly O
on O
to O
the O
little O
bench, O
and O
with O
bitter O
tears O
greeted O
the O
new O
unknown O
life O
that O
was O
beginning O
for O
him O
now. O
. O
. O
. O
What O
would O
that O
life O
be O
like? O
 O
 O

 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
Marley O
was O
dead: O
to O
begin O
with. O
There O
is O
no O
doubt O
whatever O
about O
that. O
The O
register O
of O
his O
burial O
was O
signed O
by O
the O
clergyman, O
the O
clerk, O
the O
undertaker O
and O
the O
chief O
mourner. O
Scrooge O
signed O
it. O
And O
Scrooge's O
name O
was O
good O
upon O
'Change, O
for O
anything O
he O
chose O
to O
put O
his O
hand O
to. O
Old O
Marley O
was O
as O
dead O
as O
a O
door-nail. O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
Mind! O
I O
don't O
mean O
to O
say O
that O
I O
know, O
of O
my O
own O
knowledge, O
what O
there O
is O
particularly O
dead O
about O
a O
door-nail. O
I O
might O
have O
been O
inclined, O
myself, O
to O
regard O
a O
coffin-nail O
as O
the O
deadest O
piece O
of O
ironmongery O
in O
the O
trade. O
But O
the O
wisdom O
of O
our O
ancestors O
is O
in O
the O
simile; O
and O
my O
unhallowed O
hands O
shall O
not O
disturb O
it, O
or O
the O
country's O
done O
for. O
You O
will O
therefore O
permit O
me O
to O
repeat, O
emphatically, O
that O
Marley O
was O
as O
dead O
as O
a O
door-nail. O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
Scrooge O
knew O
he O
was O
dead? O
Of O
course O
he O
did. O
How O
could O
it O
be O
otherwise? O
Scrooge O
and O
he O
were O
partners O
for O
I O
don't O
know O
how O
many O
years. O
Scrooge O
was O
his O
sole O
executor, O
his O
sole O
administrator, O
his O
sole O
assign, O
his O
sole O
residuary O
legatee, O
his O
sole O
friend O
and O
sole O
mourner. O
And O
even O
Scrooge O
was O
not O
so O
dreadfully O
cut O
up O
by O
the O
sad O
event, O
but O
that O
he O
was O
an O
excellent O
man O
of O
business O
on O
the O
very O
day O
of O
the O
funeral, O
and O
solemnised O
it O
with O
an O
undoubted O
bargain. O
The O
mention O
of O
Marley's O
funeral O
brings O
me O
back O
to O
the O
point O
I O
started O
from. O
There O
is O
no O
doubt O
that O
Marley O
was O
dead. O
This O
must O
be O
distinctly O
understood, O
or O
nothing O
wonderful O
can O
come O
of O
the O
story O
I O
am O
going O
to O
relate. O
If O
we O
were O
not O
perfectly O
convinced O
that O
Hamlet's O
father O
died O
before O
the O
play O
began, O
there O
would O
be O
nothing O
more O
remarkable O
in O
his O
taking O
a O
stroll O
at O
night, O
in O
an O
easterly O
wind, O
upon O
his O
own O
ramparts, O
than O
there O
would O
be O
in O
any O
other O
middle-aged O
gentleman O
rashly O
turning O
out O
after O
dark O
in O
a O
breezy O
spot O
-- O
say O
Saint O
Paul's O
Churchyard O
for O
instance O
-- O
literally O
to O
astonish O
his O
son's O
weak O
mind. O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
Scrooge O
never O
painted O
out O
old O
Marley's O
name. O
There O
it O
stood, O
years O
afterwards, O
above O
the O
warehouse O
door: O
Scrooge O
and O
Marley. O
The O
firm O
was O
known O
as O
Scrooge O
and O
Marley. O
Sometimes O
people O
new O
to O
the O
business O
called O
Scrooge O
Scrooge, O
and O
sometimes O
Marley, O
but O
he O
answered O
to O
both O
names. O
It O
was O
all O
the O
same O
to O
him. O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
Oh! O
But O
he O
was O
a O
tight-fisted O
hand O
at O
the O
grindstone, O
Scrooge! O
A O
squeezing, O
wrenching, O
grasping, O
scraping, O
clutching, O
covetous O
old O
sinner! O
Hard O
and O
sharp O
as O
flint, O
from O
which O
no O
steel O
had O
ever O
struck O
out O
generous O
fire; O
secret O
and O
self-contained, O
and O
solitary O
as O
an O
oyster. O
The O
cold O
within O
him O
froze O
his O
old O
features, O
nipped O
his O
pointed O
nose, O
shrivelled O
his O
cheek, O
stiffened O
his O
gait; O
made O
his O
eyes O
red, O
his O
thin O
lips O
blue; O
and O
spoke O
out O
shrewdly O
in O
his O
grating O
voice. O
A O
frosty O
rime O
was O
on O
his O
head, O
and O
on O
his O
eyebrows, O
and O
his O
wiry O
chin. O
He O
carried O
his O
own O
low O
temperature O
always O
about O
with O
him; O
he O
iced O
his O
office O
in O
the O
dog-days; O
and O
didn't O
thaw O
it O
one O
degree O
at O
Christmas. O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
External O
heat O
and O
cold O
had O
little O
influence O
on O
Scrooge. O
No O
warmth O
could O
warm, O
no O
wintry O
weather O
chill O
him. O
No O
wind O
that O
blew O
was O
bitterer O
than O
he, O
no O
falling O
snow O
was O
more O
intent O
upon O
its O
purpose, O
no O
pelting O
rain O
less O
open O
to O
entreaty. O
Foul O
weather O
didn't O
know O
where O
to O
have O
him. O
The O
heaviest O
rain, O
and O
snow, O
and O
hail, O
and O
sleet, O
could O
boast O
of O
the O
advantage O
over O
him O
in O
only O
one O
respect. O
They O
often O
"came O
down" O
handsomely, O
and O
Scrooge O
never O
did. O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
Nobody Entity
ever O
stopped O
him Entity
in O
the O
street O
to O
say Cue
with O
gladsome O
looks O
"My Quotation
dear Quotation
Scrooge, Quotation
how Quotation
are Quotation
you? Quotation
When Quotation
will Quotation
you Quotation
come Quotation
to Quotation
see Quotation
me?". Quotation
No Entity
beggars Entity
implored Cue
him Entity
to Quotation
bestow Quotation
a Quotation
trifle, Quotation
no Entity
children Entity
asked Cue
him Entity
what Quotation
it Quotation
was Quotation
o'clock, Quotation
no Entity
man Entity
or Entity

ever O
once O
in O
all O
his O
life O
inquired Cue
the Quotation
way Quotation
to Quotation
such Quotation
and Quotation
such Quotation
a Quotation
place, Quotation
of O
Scrooge. Entity
Even O
the O
blind O
men's O
dogs O
appeared O
to O
know O
him; O
and O
when O
they O
saw O
him O
coming O
on, O
would O
tug O
their Entity
owners Entity
into O
doorways O
and O
up O
courts; O
and O
then O
would O
wag O
their O
tails O
as O
though O
they Entity
said Cue
"No Quotation
eye Quotation
at Quotation
all Quotation
is Quotation
better Quotation

an Quotation
evil Quotation
eye, Quotation
dark Quotation
master!". Quotation
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
But O
what O
did O
Scrooge O
care! O
It O
was O
the O
very O
thing O
he O
liked. O
To O
edge O
his O
way O
along O
the O
crowded O
paths O
of O
life, O
warning O
all O
human O
sympathy O
to O
keep O
its O
distance, O
was O
what O
the O
knowing O
ones O
call O
"nuts" O
to O
Scrooge. O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
Once O
upon O
a O
time O
(of O
all O
the O
good O
days O
in O
the O
year, O
on O
Christmas O
Eve), O
old O
Scrooge O
sat O
busy O
in O
his O
counting-house. O
It O
was O
cold, O
bleak, O
biting O
weather: O
foggy O
withal; O
and O
he O
could O
hear O
the O
people O
in O
the O
court O
outside, O
go O
wheezing O
up O
and O
down, O
beating O
their O
hands O
upon O
their O
breasts, O
and O
stamping O
their O
feet O
upon O
the O
pavement O
stones O
to O
warm O
them. O
The O
city O
clocks O
had O
only O
just O
gone O
three, O
but O
it O
was O
quite O
dark O
already O
(it O
had O
not O
been O
light O
all O
day) O
and O
candles O
were O
flaring O
in O
the O
windows O
of O
the O
neighbouring O
offices, O
like O
ruddy O
smears O
upon O
the O
palpable O
brown O
air. O
The O
fog O
came O
pouring O
in O
at O
every O
chink O
and O
keyhole, O
and O
was O
so O
dense O
without, O
that O
although O
the O
court O
was O
of O
the O
narrowest, O
the O
houses O
opposite O
were O
mere O
phantoms. O
To O
see O
the O
dingy O
cloud O
come O
drooping O
down, O
obscuring O
everything, O
one O
might O
have O
thought O
that O
Nature O
lived O
hard O
by, O
and O
was O
brewing O
on O
a O
large O
scale. O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
The O
door O
of O
Scrooge's O
counting–house O
was O
open O
that O
he O
might O
keep O
his O
eye O
upon O
his O
clerk, O
who O
in O
a O
dismal O
little O
cell O
beyond, O
a O
sort O
of O
tank, O
was O
copying O
letters. O
Scrooge O
had O
a O
very O
small O
fire, O
but O
the O
clerk's O
fire O
was O
so O
very O
much O
smaller O
that O
it O
looked O
like O
one O
coal. O
But O
he O
couldn't O
replenish O
it, O
for O
Scrooge O
kept O
the O
coal-box O
in O
his O
own O
room; O
and O
so O
surely O
as O
the O
clerk O
came O
in O
with O
the O
shovel, O
the O
master O
predicted O
that O
it O
would O
be O
necessary O
for O
them O
to O
part. O
Wherefore O
the O
clerk O
put O
on O
his O
white O
comforter, O
and O
tried O
to O
warm O
himself O
at O
the O
candle; O
in O
which O
effort, O
not O
being O
a O
man O
of O
a O
strong O
imagination, O
he O
failed. O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
"A Quotation
merry Quotation
Christmas, Quotation
uncle! Quotation
God Quotation
save Quotation
you!", Quotation
cried Cue
a O
cheerful O
voice. O
It O
was O
the O
voice O
of O
Scrooge's Entity
nephew, O
who O
came O
upon O
him O
so O
quickly O
that O
this O
was O
the O
first O
intimation O
he O
had O
of O
his O
approach. O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
"Bah!", O
said O
Scrooge. O
"Humbug!" O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
He O
had O
so O
heated O
himself O
with O
rapid O
walking O
in O
the O
fog O
and O
frost, O
this O
nephew O
of O
Scrooge's, O
that O
he O
was O
all O
in O
a O
glow; O
his O
face O
was O
ruddy O
and O
handsome; O
his O
eyes O
sparkled, O
and O
his O
breath O
smoked O
again. O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
"Christmas O
a O
humbug, O
uncle?", O
said O
Scrooge's O
nephew. O
"You O
don't O
mean O
that, O
I O
am O
sure?" O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
"I O
do", O
said O
Scrooge. O
"'Merry O
Christmas'! O
What O
right O
have O
you O
to O
be O
merry? O
What O
reason O
have O
you O
to O
be O
merry? O
You're O
poor O
enough." O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
"Come, O
then", O
returned O
the O
nephew O
gaily. O
"What O
right O
have O
you O
to O
be O
dismal? O
What O
reason O
have O
you O
to O
be O
morose? O
You're O
rich O
enough." O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
Scrooge, O
having O
no O
better O
answer O
ready O
on O
the O
spur O
of O
the O
moment, O
said O
"Bah!" O
again O
and O
followed O
it O
up O
with O
"Humbug!". O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
"Don't O
be O
cross, O
uncle!", O
said O
the O
nephew. O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
"What O
else O
can O
I O
be", O
returned O
the O
uncle, O
"when O
I O
live O
in O
such O
a O
world O
of O
fools O
as O
this? O
Merry O
Christmas! O
Out O
upon O
merry O
Christmas! O
What's O
Christmas O
time O
to O
you O
but O
a O
time O
for O
paying O
bills O
without O
money; O
a O
time O
for O
finding O
yourself O
a O
year O
older, O
but O
not O
an O
hour O
richer; O
a O
time O
for O
balancing O
your O
books O
and O
having O
every O
item O
in O
'em O
through O
a O
round O
dozen O
of O
months O
presented O
dead O
against O
you? O
If O
I O
could O
work O
my O
will", O
said O
Scrooge O
indignantly, O
"every O
idiot O
who O
goes O
about O
with O
'Merry O
Christmas' O
on O
his O
lips O
should O
be O
boiled O
with O
his O
own O
pudding, O
and O
buried O
with O
a O
stake O
of O
holly O
through O
his O
heart. O
He O
should!" O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
"Uncle!", O
pleaded O
the O
nephew. O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
"Nephew!", O
returned O
the O
uncle O
sternly. O
"Keep O
Christmas O
in O
your O
own O
way, O
and O
let O
me O
keep O
it O
in O
mine." O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
"Keep O
it!", O
repeated O
Scrooge's O
nephew. O
"But O
you O
don't O
keep O
it." O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
"Let O
me O
leave O
it O
alone, O
then", O
said O
Scrooge. O
"Much O
good O
may O
it O
do O
you! O
Much O
good O
it O
has O
ever O
done O
you!" O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
"There O
are O
many O
things O
from O
which O
I O
might O
have O
derived O
good, O
by O
which O
I O
have O
not O
profited, O
I O
dare O
say", O
returned O
the O
nephew. O
"Christmas O
among O
the O
rest. O
But O
I O
am O
sure O
I O
have O
always O
thought O
of O
Christmas O
time, O
when O
it O
has O
come O
round—apart O
from O
the O
veneration O
due O
to O
its O
sacred O
name O
and O
origin, O
if O
anything O
belonging O
to O
it O
can O
be O
apart O
from O
that—as O
a O
good O
time; O
a O
kind, O
forgiving, O
charitable, O
pleasant O
time; O
the O
only O
time O
I O
know O
of, O
in O
the O
long O
calendar O
of O
the O
year, O
when O
men O
and O
women O
seem O
by O
one O
consent O
to O
open O
their O
shut–up O
hearts O
freely, O
and O
to O
think O
of O
people O
below O
them O
as O
if O
they O
really O
were O
fellow–passengers O
to O
the O
grave, O
and O
not O
another O
race O
of O
creatures O
bound O
on O
other O
journeys. O
And O
therefore, O
uncle, O
though O
it O
has O
never O
put O
a O
scrap O
of O
gold O
or O
silver O
in O
my O
pocket, O
I O
believe O
that O
it O
has O
done O
me O
good, O
and O
will O
do O
me O
good; O
and O
I O
say, O
God O
bless O
it!" O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
The O
clerk O
in O
the O
tank O
involuntarily O
applauded. O
Becoming O
immediately O
sensible O
of O
the O
impropriety, O
he O
poked O
the O
fire, O
and O
extinguished O
the O
last O
frail O
spark O
for O
ever. O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
"Let O
me O
hear O
another O
sound O
from O
you", O
said O
Scrooge, O
"and O
you'll O
keep O
your O
Christmas O
by O
losing O
your O
situation! O
You're O
quite O
a O
powerful O
speaker, O
sir", O
he O
added, O
turning O
to O
his O
nephew. O
"I O
wonder O
you O
don't O
go O
into O
Parliament." O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
"Don't O
be O
angry, O
uncle. O
Come! O
Dine O
with O
us O
tomorrow." O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
Scrooge O
said O
that O
he O
would O
see O
him—yes, O
indeed O
he O
did. O
He O
went O
the O
whole O
length O
of O
the O
expression, O
and O
said O
that O
he O
would O
see O
him O
in O
that O
extremity O
first. O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
"But O
why?", O
cried O
Scrooge's O
nephew. O
"Why?" O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
"Why O
did O
you O
get O
married?", O
said O
Scrooge. O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
"Because O
I O
fell O
in O
love." O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
"Because O
you O
fell O
in O
love!", O
growled O
Scrooge, O
as O
if O
that O
were O
the O
only O
one O
thing O
in O
the O
world O
more O
ridiculous O
than O
a O
merry O
Christmas. O
"Good O
afternoon!" O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
"Nay, O
uncle, O
but O
you O
never O
came O
to O
see O
me O
before O
that O
happened. O
Why O
give O
it O
as O
a O
reason O
for O
not O
coming O
now?" O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
"Good O
afternoon", O
said O
Scrooge. O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
"I O
want O
nothing O
from O
you; O
I O
ask O
nothing O
of O
you; O
why O
cannot O
we O
be O
friends?" O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
"Good O
afternoon", O
said O
Scrooge. O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
"I O
am O
sorry, O
with O
all O
my O
heart, O
to O
find O
you O
so O
resolute. O
We O
have O
never O
had O
any O
quarrel, O
to O
which O
I O
have O
been O
a O
party. O
But O
I O
have O
made O
the O
trial O
in O
homage O
to O
Christmas, O
and O
I'll O
keep O
my O
Christmas O
humour O
to O
the O
last. O
So O
a O
merry O
Christmas, O
uncle!" O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
"Good O
afternoon!", O
said O
Scrooge. O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
"And O
a O
happy O
New O
Year!" O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
"Good O
afternoon!", O
said O
Scrooge. O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
His O
nephew O
left O
the O
room O
without O
an O
angry O
word, O
notwithstanding. O
He O
stopped O
at O
the O
outer O
door O
to O
bestow O
the O
greetings O
of O
the O
season O
on O
the O
clerk, O
who, O
cold O
as O
he O
was, O
was O
warmer O
than O
Scrooge; O
for O
he O
returned O
them O
cordially. O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
"There's O
another O
fellow", O
muttered O
Scrooge; O
who O
overheard O
him: O
"My O
clerk, O
with O
fifteen O
shillings O
a O
week, O
and O
a O
wife O
and O
family, O
talking O
about O
a O
merry O
Christmas. O
I'll O
retire O
to O
Bedlam." O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
This O
lunatic, O
in O
letting O
Scrooge's O
nephew O
out, O
had O
let O
two O
other O
people O
in. O
They O
were O
portly O
gentlemen, O
pleasant O
to O
behold, O
and O
now O
stood, O
with O
their O
hats O
off, O
in O
Scrooge's O
office. O
They O
had O
books O
and O
papers O
in O
their O
hands, O
and O
bowed O
to O
him. O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
"Scrooge O
and O
Marley's, O
I O
believe", O
said O
one O
of O
the O
gentlemen, O
referring O
to O
his O
list. O
"Have O
I O
the O
pleasure O
of O
addressing O
Mr. O
Scrooge O
or O
Mr. O
Marley?" O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
"Mr. O
Marley O
has O
been O
dead O
these O
seven O
years", O
Scrooge O
replied. O
"He O
died O
seven O
years O
ago, O
this O
very O
night." O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
"We O
have O
no O
doubt O
his O
liberality O
is O
well O
represented O
by O
his O
surviving O
partner", O
said O
the O
gentleman, O
presenting O
his O
credentials. O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
It O
certainly O
was; O
for O
they O
had O
been O
two O
kindred O
spirits. O
At O
the O
ominous O
word O
"liberality", O
Scrooge O
frowned, O
and O
shook O
his O
head, O
and O
handed O
the O
credentials O
back. O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
"At O
this O
festive O
season O
of O
the O
year, O
Mr. O
Scrooge", O
said O
the O
gentleman, O
taking O
up O
a O
pen, O
"it O
is O
more O
than O
usually O
desirable O
that O
we O
should O
make O
some O
slight O
provision O
for O
the O
poor O
and O
destitute, O
who O
suffer O
greatly O
at O
the O
present O
time. O
Many O
thousands O
are O
in O
want O
of O
common O
necessaries; O
hundreds O
of O
thousands O
are O
in O
want O
of O
common O
comforts, O
sir." O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
"Are O
there O
no O
prisons?", O
asked O
Scrooge. O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
"Plenty O
of O
prisons", O
said O
the O
gentleman, O
laying O
down O
the O
pen O
again. O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
"And O
the O
Union O
workhouses?", O
demanded O
Scrooge. O
"Are O
they O
still O
in O
operation?" O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
"They O
are. O
Still", O
returned O
the O
gentleman, O
"I O
wish O
I O
could O
say O
they O
were O
not." O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
"The O
Treadmill O
and O
the O
Poor O
Law O
are O
in O
full O
vigour, O
then?", O
said O
Scrooge. O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
"Both O
very O
busy, O
sir." O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
"Oh! O
I O
was O
afraid, O
from O
what O
you O
said O
at O
first, O
that O
something O
had O
occurred O
to O
stop O
them O
in O
their O
useful O
course", O
said O
Scrooge. O
"I'm O
very O
glad O
to O
hear O
it." O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
"Under O
the O
impression O
that O
they O
scarcely O
furnish O
Christian O
cheer O
of O
mind O
or O
body O
to O
the O
multitude", O
returned O
the O
gentleman, O
"a O
few O
of O
us O
are O
endeavouring O
to O
raise O
a O
fund O
to O
buy O
the O
poor O
some O
meat O
and O
drink, O
and O
means O
of O
warmth. O
We O
choose O
this O
time, O
because O
it O
is O
a O
time, O
of O
all O
others, O
when O
want O
is O
keenly O
felt, O
and O
abundance O
rejoices. O
What O
shall O
I O
put O
you O
down O
for?" O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
"Nothing!", O
Scrooge O
replied. O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
"You O
wish O
to O
be O
anonymous?" O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
"I O
wish O
to O
be O
left O
alone", O
said O
Scrooge. O
"Since O
you O
ask O
me O
what O
I O
wish, O
gentlemen, O
that O
is O
my O
answer. O
I O
don't O
make O
merry O
myself O
at O
Christmas O
and O
I O
can't O
afford O
to O
make O
idle O
people O
merry. O
I O
help O
to O
support O
the O
establishments O
I O
have O
mentioned—they O
cost O
enough; O
and O
those O
who O
are O
badly O
off O
must O
go O
there." O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
"Many O
can't O
go O
there; O
and O
many O
would O
rather O
die." O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
"If O
they O
would O
rather O
die", O
said O
Scrooge, O
"they O
had O
better O
do O
it, O
and O
decrease O
the O
surplus O
population. O
Besides—excuse O
me—I O
don't O
know O
that." O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
"But O
you O
might O
know O
it", O
observed O
the O
gentleman. O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
"It's O
not O
my O
business", O
Scrooge O
returned. O
"It's O
enough O
for O
a O
man O
to O
understand O
his O
own O
business, O
and O
not O
to O
interfere O
with O
other O
people's. O
Mine O
occupies O
me O
constantly. O
Good O
afternoon, O
gentlemen!" O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
Seeing O
clearly O
that O
it O
would O
be O
useless O
to O
pursue O
their O
point, O
the O
gentlemen O
withdrew. O
Scrooge O
resumed O
his O
labours O
with O
an O
improved O
opinion O
of O
himself, O
and O
in O
a O
more O
facetious O
temper O
than O
was O
usual O
with O
him. O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
Meanwhile O
the O
fog O
and O
darkness O
thickened O
so, O
that O
people O
ran O
about O
with O
flaring O
links, O
proffering O
their O
services O
to O
go O
before O
horses O
in O
carriages, O
and O
conduct O
them O
on O
their O
way. O
The O
ancient O
tower O
of O
a O
church, O
whose O
gruff O
old O
bell O
was O
always O
peeping O
slily O
down O
at O
Scrooge O
out O
of O
a O
Gothic O
window O
in O
the O
wall, O
became O
invisible, O
and O
struck O
the O
hours O
and O
quarters O
in O
the O
clouds, O
with O
tremulous O
vibrations O
afterwards O
as O
if O
its O
teeth O
were O
chattering O
in O
its O
frozen O
head O
up O
there. O
The O
cold O
became O
intense. O
In O
the O
main O
street, O
at O
the O
corner O
of O
the O
court, O
some O
labourers O
were O
repairing O
the O
gas–pipes, O
and O
had O
lighted O
a O
great O
fire O
in O
a O
brazier, O
round O
which O
a O
party O
of O
ragged O
men O
and O
boys O
were O
gathered: O
warming O
their O
hands O
and O
winking O
their O
eyes O
before O
the O
blaze O
in O
rapture. O
The O
water–plug O
being O
left O
in O
solitude, O
its O
overflowings O
sullenly O
congealed, O
and O
turned O
to O
misanthropic O
ice. O
The O
brightness O
of O
the O
shops O
where O
holly O
sprigs O
and O
berries O
crackled O
in O
the O
lamp O
heat O
of O
the O
windows, O
made O
pale O
faces O
ruddy O
as O
they O
passed. O
Poulterers' O
and O
grocers' O
trades O
became O
a O
splendid O
joke: O
a O
glorious O
pageant, O
with O
which O
it O
was O
next O
to O
impossible O
to O
believe O
that O
such O
dull O
principles O
as O
bargain O
and O
sale O
had O
anything O
to O
do. O
The O
Lord O
Mayor, O
in O
the O
stronghold O
of O
the O
mighty O
Mansion O
House, O
gave O
orders O
to O
his O
fifty O
cooks O
and O
butlers O
to O
keep O
Christmas O
as O
a O
Lord O
Mayor's O
household O
should; O
and O
even O
the O
little O
tailor, O
whom O
he O
had O
fined O
five O
shillings O
on O
the O
previous O
Monday O
for O
being O
drunk O
and O
bloodthirsty O
in O
the O
streets, O
stirred O
up O
tomorrow's O
pudding O
in O
his O
garret, O
while O
his O
lean O
wife O
and O
the O
baby O
sallied O
out O
to O
buy O
the O
beef. O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
Foggier O
yet, O
and O
colder. O
Piercing, O
searching, O
biting O
cold. O
If O
the O
good O
Saint O
Dunstan O
had O
but O
nipped O
the O
Evil O
Spirit's O
nose O
with O
a O
touch O
of O
such O
weather O
as O
that, O
instead O
of O
using O
his O
familiar O
weapons, O
then O
indeed O
he O
would O
have O
roared O
to O
lusty O
purpose. O
The O
owner O
of O
one O
scant O
young O
nose, O
gnawed O
and O
mumbled O
by O
the O
hungry O
cold O
as O
bones O
are O
gnawed O
by O
dogs, O
stooped O
down O
at O
Scrooge's O
keyhole O
to O
regale O
him O
with O
a O
Christmas O
carol: O
but O
at O
the O
first O
sound O
of O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
"God O
bless O
you, O
merry O
gentlemen! O
May O
nothing O
you O
dismay!", O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
Scrooge O
seized O
the O
ruler O
with O
such O
energy O
of O
action, O
that O
the O
singer O
fled O
in O
terror, O
leaving O
the O
keyhole O
to O
the O
fog O
and O
even O
more O
congenial O
frost. O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
At O
length O
the O
hour O
of O
shutting O
up O
the O
counting–house O
arrived. O
With O
an O
ill–will O
Scrooge O
dismounted O
from O
his O
stool, O
and O
tacitly O
admitted O
the O
fact O
to O
the O
expectant O
clerk O
in O
the O
tank, O
who O
instantly O
snuffed O
his O
candle O
out, O
and O
put O
on O
his O
hat. O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
"You'll O
want O
all O
day O
tomorrow, O
I O
suppose?", O
said O
Scrooge. O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
"If O
quite O
convenient, O
sir." O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
"It’s O
not O
convenient", O
said O
Scrooge, O
"and O
it's O
not O
fair. O
If O
I O
was O
to O
stop O
you O
half–a–crown O
for O
it, O
you'd O
think O
yourself O
ill–used, O
I'll O
be O
bound?" O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
The O
clerk O
smiled O
faintly. O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
"And O
yet", O
said O
Scrooge, O
"you O
don't O
think O
me O
ill–used, O
when O
I O
pay O
a O
day's O
wages O
for O
no O
work." O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
The O
clerk O
observed O
that O
it O
was O
only O
once O
a O
year. O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
"A O
poor O
excuse O
for O
picking O
a O
man's O
pocket O
every O
twenty–fifth O
of O
December!", O
said O
Scrooge, O
buttoning O
his O
great–coat O
to O
the O
chin. O
"But O
I O
suppose O
you O
must O
have O
the O
whole O
day. O
Be O
here O
all O
the O
earlier O
next O
morning." O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
The O
clerk O
promised O
that O
he O
would; O
and O
Scrooge O
walked O
out O
with O
a O
growl. O
The O
office O
was O
closed O
in O
a O
twinkling, O
and O
the O
clerk, O
with O
the O
long O
ends O
of O
his O
white O
comforter O
dangling O
below O
his O
waist O
(for O
he O
boasted O
no O
great–coat), O
went O
down O
a O
slide O
on O
Cornhill, O
at O
the O
end O
of O
a O
lane O
of O
boys, O
twenty O
times, O
in O
honour O
of O
its O
being O
Christmas O
Eve, O
and O
then O
ran O
home O
to O
Camden O
Town O
as O
hard O
as O
he O
could O
pelt, O
to O
play O
at O
blindman's–buff. O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
Scrooge O
took O
his O
melancholy O
dinner O
in O
his O
usual O
melancholy O
tavern; O
and O
having O
read O
all O
the O
newspapers, O
and O
beguiled O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
evening O
with O
his O
banker's–book, O
went O
home O
to O
bed. O
He O
lived O
in O
chambers O
which O
had O
once O
belonged O
to O
his O
deceased O
partner. O
They O
were O
a O
gloomy O
suite O
of O
rooms, O
in O
a O
lowering O
pile O
of O
a O
building O
up O
a O
yard, O
where O
it O
had O
so O
little O
business O
to O
be, O
that O
one O
could O
scarcely O
help O
fancying O
it O
must O
have O
run O
there O
when O
it O
was O
a O
young O
house, O
playing O
at O
hide–and–seek O
with O
other O
houses, O
and O
forgotten O
the O
way O
out O
again. O
It O
was O
old O
enough O
now, O
and O
dreary O
enough, O
for O
nobody O
lived O
in O
it O
but O
Scrooge, O
the O
other O
rooms O
being O
all O
let O
out O
as O
offices. O
The O
yard O
was O
so O
dark O
that O
even O
Scrooge, O
who O
knew O
its O
every O
stone, O
was O
fain O
to O
grope O
with O
his O
hands. O
The O
fog O
and O
frost O
so O
hung O
about O
the O
black O
old O
gateway O
of O
the O
house, O
that O
it O
seemed O
as O
if O
the O
Genius O
of O
the O
Weather O
sat O
in O
mournful O
meditation O
on O
the O
threshold. O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
Now, O
it O
is O
a O
fact, O
that O
there O
was O
nothing O
at O
all O
particular O
about O
the O
knocker O
on O
the O
door, O
except O
that O
it O
was O
very O
large. O
It O
is O
also O
a O
fact, O
that O
Scrooge O
had O
seen O
it, O
night O
and O
morning, O
during O
his O
whole O
residence O
in O
that O
place; O
also O
that O
Scrooge O
had O
as O
little O
of O
what O
is O
called O
fancy O
about O
him O
as O
any O
man O
in O
the O
city O
of O
London, O
even O
including—which O
is O
a O
bold O
word—the O
corporation, O
aldermen, O
and O
livery. O
Let O
it O
also O
be O
borne O
in O
mind O
that O
Scrooge O
had O
not O
bestowed O
one O
thought O
on O
Marley, O
since O
his O
last O
mention O
of O
his O
seven O
years' O
dead O
partner O
that O
afternoon. O
And O
then O
let O
any O
man O
explain O
to O
me, O
if O
he O
can, O
how O
it O
happened O
that O
Scrooge, O
having O
his O
key O
in O
the O
lock O
of O
the O
door, O
saw O
in O
the O
knocker, O
without O
its O
undergoing O
any O
intermediate O
process O
of O
change—not O
a O
knocker, O
but O
Marley's O
face. O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
Marley's O
face. O
It O
was O
not O
in O
impenetrable O
shadow O
as O
the O
other O
objects O
in O
the O
yard O
were, O
but O
had O
a O
dismal O
light O
about O
it, O
like O
a O
bad O
lobster O
in O
a O
dark O
cellar. O
It O
was O
not O
angry O
or O
ferocious, O
but O
looked O
at O
Scrooge O
as O
Marley O
used O
to O
look: O
with O
ghostly O
spectacles O
turned O
up O
on O
its O
ghostly O
forehead. O
The O
hair O
was O
curiously O
stirred, O
as O
if O
by O
breath O
or O
hot O
air; O
and, O
though O
the O
eyes O
were O
wide O
open, O
they O
were O
perfectly O
motionless. O
That, O
and O
its O
livid O
colour, O
made O
it O
horrible; O
but O
its O
horror O
seemed O
to O
be O
in O
spite O
of O
the O
face O
and O
beyond O
its O
control, O
rather O
than O
a O
part O
of O
its O
own O
expression. O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
As O
Scrooge O
looked O
fixedly O
at O
this O
phenomenon, O
it O
was O
a O
knocker O
again. O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
To O
say O
that O
he O
was O
not O
startled, O
or O
that O
his O
blood O
was O
not O
conscious O
of O
a O
terrible O
sensation O
to O
which O
it O
had O
been O
a O
stranger O
from O
infancy, O
would O
be O
untrue. O
But O
he O
put O
his O
hand O
upon O
the O
key O
he O
had O
relinquished, O
turned O
it O
sturdily, O
walked O
in, O
and O
lighted O
his O
candle. O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
He O
did O
pause, O
with O
a O
moment's O
irresolution, O
before O
he O
shut O
the O
door; O
and O
he O
did O
look O
cautiously O
behind O
it O
first, O
as O
if O
he O
half–expected O
to O
be O
terrified O
with O
the O
sight O
of O
Marley's O
pigtail O
sticking O
out O
into O
the O
hall. O
But O
there O
was O
nothing O
on O
the O
back O
of O
the O
door, O
except O
the O
screws O
and O
nuts O
that O
held O
the O
knocker O
on, O
so O
he O
said O
"Pooh, O
pooh!" O
and O
closed O
it O
with O
a O
bang. O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
The O
sound O
resounded O
through O
the O
house O
like O
thunder. O
Every O
room O
above, O
and O
every O
cask O
in O
the O
wine–merchant's O
cellars O
below, O
appeared O
to O
have O
a O
separate O
peal O
of O
echoes O
of O
its O
own. O
Scrooge O
was O
not O
a O
man O
to O
be O
frightened O
by O
echoes. O
He O
fastened O
the O
door, O
and O
walked O
across O
the O
hall, O
and O
up O
the O
stairs; O
slowly O
too: O
trimming O
his O
candle O
as O
he O
went. O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
You O
may O
talk O
vaguely O
about O
driving O
a O
coach–and–six O
up O
a O
good O
old O
flight O
of O
stairs, O
or O
through O
a O
bad O
young O
Act O
of O
Parliament; O
but O
I O
mean O
to O
say O
you O
might O
have O
got O
a O
hearse O
up O
that O
staircase, O
and O
taken O
it O
broadwise, O
with O
the O
splinter–bar O
towards O
the O
wall O
and O
the O
door O
towards O
the O
balustrades: O
and O
done O
it O
easy. O
There O
was O
plenty O
of O
width O
for O
that, O
and O
room O
to O
spare; O
which O
is O
perhaps O
the O
reason O
why O
Scrooge O
thought O
he O
saw O
a O
locomotive O
hearse O
going O
on O
before O
him O
in O
the O
gloom. O
Half–a–dozen O
gas–lamps O
out O
of O
the O
street O
wouldn't O
have O
lighted O
the O
entry O
too O
well, O
so O
you O
may O
suppose O
that O
it O
was O
pretty O
dark O
with O
Scrooge's O
dip. O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
Up O
Scrooge O
went, O
not O
caring O
a O
button O
for O
that. O
Darkness O
is O
cheap, O
and O
Scrooge O
liked O
it. O
But O
before O
he O
shut O
his O
heavy O
door, O
he O
walked O
through O
his O
rooms O
to O
see O
that O
all O
was O
right. O
He O
had O
just O
enough O
recollection O
of O
the O
face O
to O
desire O
to O
do O
that. O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
Sitting–room, O
bedroom, O
lumber–room. O
All O
as O
they O
should O
be. O
Nobody O
under O
the O
table, O
nobody O
under O
the O
sofa; O
a O
small O
fire O
in O
the O
grate; O
spoon O
and O
basin O
ready; O
and O
the O
little O
saucepan O
of O
gruel O
(Scrooge O
had O
a O
cold O
in O
his O
head) O
upon O
the O
hob. O
Nobody O
under O
the O
bed; O
nobody O
in O
the O
closet; O
nobody O
in O
his O
dressing–gown, O
which O
was O
hanging O
up O
in O
a O
suspicious O
attitude O
against O
the O
wall. O
Lumber–room O
as O
usual. O
Old O
fire–guards, O
old O
shoes, O
two O
fish–baskets, O
washing–stand O
on O
three O
legs, O
and O
a O
poker. O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
Quite O
satisfied, O
he O
closed O
his O
door, O
and O
locked O
himself O
in; O
double–locked O
himself O
in, O
which O
was O
not O
his O
custom. O
Thus O
secured O
against O
surprise, O
he O
took O
off O
his O
cravat; O
put O
on O
his O
dressing–gown O
and O
slippers, O
and O
his O
nightcap; O
and O
sat O
down O
before O
the O
fire O
to O
take O
his O
gruel. O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
It O
was O
a O
very O
low O
fire O
indeed; O
nothing O
on O
such O
a O
bitter O
night. O
He O
was O
obliged O
to O
sit O
close O
to O
it, O
and O
brood O
over O
it, O
before O
he O
could O
extract O
the O
least O
sensation O
of O
warmth O
from O
such O
a O
handful O
of O
fuel. O
The O
fireplace O
was O
an O
old O
one, O
built O
by O
some O
Dutch O
merchant O
long O
ago, O
and O
paved O
all O
round O
with O
quaint O
Dutch O
tiles, O
designed O
to O
illustrate O
the O
Scriptures. O
There O
were O
Cains O
and O
Abels, O
Pharaoh's O
daughters; O
Queens O
of O
Sheba, O
Angelic O
messengers O
descending O
through O
the O
air O
on O
clouds O
like O
feather–beds, O
Abrahams, O
Belshazzars, O
Apostles O
putting O
off O
to O
sea O
in O
butter–boats, O
hundreds O
of O
figures O
to O
attract O
his O
thoughts—and O
yet O
that O
face O
of O
Marley, O
seven O
years O
dead, O
came O
like O
the O
ancient O
Prophet's O
rod, O
and O
swallowed O
up O
the O
whole. O
If O
each O
smooth O
tile O
had O
been O
a O
blank O
at O
first, O
with O
power O
to O
shape O
some O
picture O
on O
its O
surface O
from O
the O
disjointed O
fragments O
of O
his O
thoughts, O
there O
would O
have O
been O
a O
copy O
of O
old O
Marley's O
head O
on O
every O
one. O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
"Humbug!", O
said O
Scrooge; O
and O
walked O
across O
the O
room. O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
After O
several O
turns, O
he O
sat O
down O
again. O
As O
he O
threw O
his O
head O
back O
in O
the O
chair, O
his O
glance O
happened O
to O
rest O
upon O
a O
bell, O
a O
disused O
bell, O
that O
hung O
in O
the O
room, O
and O
communicated O
for O
some O
purpose O
now O
forgotten O
with O
a O
chamber O
in O
the O
highest O
story O
of O
the O
building. O
It O
was O
with O
great O
astonishment, O
and O
with O
a O
strange, O
inexplicable O
dread, O
that O
as O
he O
looked, O
he O
saw O
this O
bell O
begin O
to O
swing. O
It O
swung O
so O
softly O
in O
the O
outset O
that O
it O
scarcely O
made O
a O
sound; O
but O
soon O
it O
rang O
out O
loudly, O
and O
so O
did O
every O
bell O
in O
the O
house. O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
This O
might O
have O
lasted O
half O
a O
minute, O
or O
a O
minute, O
but O
it O
seemed O
an O
hour. O
The O
bells O
ceased O
as O
they O
had O
begun, O
together. O
They O
were O
succeeded O
by O
a O
clanking O
noise, O
deep O
down O
below; O
as O
if O
some O
person O
were O
dragging O
a O
heavy O
chain O
over O
the O
casks O
in O
the O
wine–merchant's O
cellar. O
Scrooge O
then O
remembered O
to O
have O
heard O
that O
ghosts O
in O
haunted O
houses O
were O
described O
as O
dragging O
chains. O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
The O
cellar–door O
flew O
open O
with O
a O
booming O
sound, O
and O
then O
he O
heard O
the O
noise O
much O
louder, O
on O
the O
floors O
below; O
then O
coming O
up O
the O
stairs; O
then O
coming O
straight O
towards O
his O
door. O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
"It's O
humbug O
still!", O
said O
Scrooge. O
"I O
won't O
believe O
it." O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
His O
colour O
changed O
though, O
when, O
without O
a O
pause, O
it O
came O
on O
through O
the O
heavy O
door, O
and O
passed O
into O
the O
room O
before O
his O
eyes. O
Upon O
its O
coming O
in, O
the O
dying O
flame O
leaped O
up, O
as O
though O
it O
cried O
"I O
know O
him; O
Marley’s O
Ghost!" O
and O
fell O
again. O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
The O
same O
face: O
the O
very O
same. O
Marley O
in O
his O
pigtail, O
usual O
waistcoat, O
tights O
and O
boots; O
the O
tassels O
on O
the O
latter O
bristling, O
like O
his O
pigtail, O
and O
his O
coat–skirts, O
and O
the O
hair O
upon O
his O
head. O
The O
chain O
he O
drew O
was O
clasped O
about O
his O
middle. O
It O
was O
long, O
and O
wound O
about O
him O
like O
a O
tail; O
and O
it O
was O
made O
(for O
Scrooge O
observed O
it O
closely) O
of O
cash–boxes, O
keys, O
padlocks, O
ledgers, O
deeds, O
and O
heavy O
purses O
wrought O
in O
steel. O
His O
body O
was O
transparent; O
so O
that O
Scrooge, O
observing O
him, O
and O
looking O
through O
his O
waistcoat, O
could O
see O
the O
two O
buttons O
on O
his O
coat O
behind. O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
Scrooge O
had O
often O
heard O
it O
said O
that O
Marley O
had O
no O
bowels, O
but O
he O
had O
never O
believed O
it O
until O
now. O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
No, O
nor O
did O
he O
believe O
it O
even O
now. O
Though O
he O
looked O
the O
phantom O
through O
and O
through, O
and O
saw O
it O
standing O
before O
him; O
though O
he O
felt O
the O
chilling O
influence O
of O
its O
death–cold O
eyes; O
and O
marked O
the O
very O
texture O
of O
the O
folded O
kerchief O
bound O
about O
its O
head O
and O
chin, O
which O
wrapper O
he O
had O
not O
observed O
before; O
he O
was O
still O
incredulous, O
and O
fought O
against O
his O
senses. O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
"How O
now!", O
said O
Scrooge, O
caustic O
and O
cold O
as O
ever. O
"What O
do O
you O
want O
with O
me?" O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
"Much!"—Marley's O
voice, O
no O
doubt O
about O
it. O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
"Who O
are O
you?" O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
"Ask O
me O
who O
I O
was." O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
"Who O
were O
you O
then?", O
said O
Scrooge, O
raising O
his O
voice. O
"You're O
particular, O
for O
a O
shade." O
He O
was O
going O
to O
say O
"to O
a O
shade", O
but O
substituted O
this, O
as O
more O
appropriate. O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
"In O
life O
I O
was O
your O
partner, O
Jacob O
Marley." O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
"Can O
you—can O
you O
sit O
down?", O
asked O
Scrooge, O
looking O
doubtfully O
at O
him. O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
"I O
can." O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
"Do O
it, O
then." O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
Scrooge O
asked O
the O
question, O
because O
he O
didn't O
know O
whether O
a O
ghost O
so O
transparent O
might O
find O
himself O
in O
a O
condition O
to O
take O
a O
chair; O
and O
felt O
that O
in O
the O
event O
of O
its O
being O
impossible, O
it O
might O
involve O
the O
necessity O
of O
an O
embarrassing O
explanation. O
But O
the O
ghost O
sat O
down O
on O
the O
opposite O
side O
of O
the O
fireplace, O
as O
if O
he O
were O
quite O
used O
to O
it. O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
"You O
don't O
believe O
in O
me", O
observed O
the O
Ghost. O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
"I O
don't", O
said O
Scrooge. O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
"What O
evidence O
would O
you O
have O
of O
my O
reality O
beyond O
that O
of O
your O
senses?" O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
"I O
don't O
know", O
said O
Scrooge. O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
"Why O
do O
you O
doubt O
your O
senses?" O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
"Because", O
said O
Scrooge, O
"a O
little O
thing O
affects O
them. O
A O
slight O
disorder O
of O
the O
stomach O
makes O
them O
cheats. O
You O
may O
be O
an O
undigested O
bit O
of O
beef, O
a O
blot O
of O
mustard, O
a O
crumb O
of O
cheese, O
a O
fragment O
of O
an O
underdone O
potato. O
There's O
more O
of O
gravy O
than O
of O
grave O
about O
you, O
whatever O
you O
are!" O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
Scrooge O
was O
not O
much O
in O
the O
habit O
of O
cracking O
jokes, O
nor O
did O
he O
feel, O
in O
his O
heart, O
by O
any O
means O
waggish O
then. O
The O
truth O
is, O
that O
he O
tried O
to O
be O
smart, O
as O
a O
means O
of O
distracting O
his O
own O
attention, O
and O
keeping O
down O
his O
terror; O
for O
the O
spectre's O
voice O
disturbed O
the O
very O
marrow O
in O
his O
bones. O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
To O
sit, O
staring O
at O
those O
fixed O
glazed O
eyes, O
in O
silence O
for O
a O
moment, O
would O
play, O
Scrooge O
felt, O
the O
very O
deuce O
with O
him. O
There O
was O
something O
very O
awful, O
too, O
in O
the O
spectre's O
being O
provided O
with O
an O
infernal O
atmosphere O
of O
its O
own. O
Scrooge O
could O
not O
feel O
it O
himself, O
but O
this O
was O
clearly O
the O
case; O
for O
though O
the O
Ghost O
sat O
perfectly O
motionless, O
its O
hair, O
and O
skirts, O
and O
tassels, O
were O
still O
agitated O
as O
by O
the O
hot O
vapour O
from O
an O
oven. O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
"You O
see O
this O
toothpick?", O
said O
Scrooge, O
returning O
quickly O
to O
the O
charge, O
for O
the O
reason O
just O
assigned; O
and O
wishing, O
though O
it O
were O
only O
for O
a O
second, O
to O
divert O
the O
vision's O
stony O
gaze O
from O
himself. O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
"I O
do", O
replied O
the O
Ghost. O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
"You O
are O
not O
looking O
at O
it", O
said O
Scrooge. O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
"But O
I O
see O
it", O
said O
the O
Ghost, O
"notwithstanding." O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
"Well!", O
returned O
Scrooge. O
"I O
have O
but O
to O
swallow O
this, O
and O
be O
for O
the O
rest O
of O
my O
days O
persecuted O
by O
a O
legion O
of O
goblins, O
all O
of O
my O
own O
creation. O
Humbug, O
I O
tell O
you! O
humbug!" O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
At O
this O
the O
spirit O
raised O
a O
frightful O
cry, O
and O
shook O
its O
chain O
with O
such O
a O
dismal O
and O
appalling O
noise, O
that O
Scrooge O
held O
on O
tight O
to O
his O
chair, O
to O
save O
himself O
from O
falling O
in O
a O
swoon. O
But O
how O
much O
greater O
was O
his O
horror, O
when O
the O
phantom O
taking O
off O
the O
bandage O
round O
its O
head, O
as O
if O
it O
were O
too O
warm O
to O
wear O
indoors, O
its O
lower O
jaw O
dropped O
down O
upon O
its O
breast! O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
Scrooge O
fell O
upon O
his O
knees, O
and O
clasped O
his O
hands O
before O
his O
face. O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
"Mercy!", O
he O
said. O
"Dreadful O
apparition, O
why O
do O
you O
trouble O
me?" O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
"Man O
of O
the O
worldly O
mind!", O
replied O
the O
Ghost. O
"Do O
you O
believe O
in O
me O
or O
not?" O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
"I O
do", O
said O
Scrooge. O
"I O
must. O
But O
why O
do O
spirits O
walk O
the O
earth, O
and O
why O
do O
they O
come O
to O
me?" O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
"It O
is O
required O
of O
every O
man", O
the O
Ghost O
returned, O
"that O
the O
spirit O
within O
him O
should O
walk O
abroad O
among O
his O
fellowmen, O
and O
travel O
far O
and O
wide; O
and O
if O
that O
spirit O
goes O
not O
forth O
in O
life, O
it O
is O
condemned O
to O
do O
so O
after O
death. O
It O
is O
doomed O
to O
wander O
through O
the O
world—oh, O
woe O
is O
me!—and O
witness O
what O
it O
cannot O
share, O
but O
might O
have O
shared O
on O
earth, O
and O
turned O
to O
happiness!" O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
Again O
the O
spectre O
raised O
a O
cry, O
and O
shook O
its O
chain O
and O
wrung O
its O
shadowy O
hands. O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
"You O
are O
fettered", O
said O
Scrooge, O
trembling. O
"Tell O
me O
why?" O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
"I O
wear O
the O
chain O
I O
forged O
in O
life", O
replied O
the O
Ghost. O
"I O
made O
it O
link O
by O
link, O
and O
yard O
by O
yard; O
I O
girded O
it O
on O
of O
my O
own O
free O
will, O
and O
of O
my O
own O
free O
will O
I O
wore O
it. O
Is O
its O
pattern O
strange O
to O
you?" O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
Scrooge O
trembled O
more O
and O
more. O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
"Or O
would O
you O
know", O
pursued O
the O
Ghost, O
"the O
weight O
and O
length O
of O
the O
strong O
coil O
you O
bear O
yourself? O
It O
was O
full O
as O
heavy O
and O
as O
long O
as O
this, O
seven O
Christmas O
Eves O
ago. O
You O
have O
laboured O
on O
it, O
since. O
It O
is O
a O
ponderous O
chain!" O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
Scrooge O
glanced O
about O
him O
on O
the O
floor, O
in O
the O
expectation O
of O
finding O
himself O
surrounded O
by O
some O
fifty O
or O
sixty O
fathoms O
of O
iron O
cable: O
but O
he O
could O
see O
nothing. O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
"Jacob", O
he O
said, O
imploringly. O
"Old O
Jacob O
Marley, O
tell O
me O
more. O
Speak O
comfort O
to O
me, O
Jacob!" O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
"I O
have O
none O
to O
give", O
the O
Ghost O
replied. O
"It O
comes O
from O
other O
regions, O
Ebenezer O
Scrooge, O
and O
is O
conveyed O
by O
other O
ministers, O
to O
other O
kinds O
of O
men. O
Nor O
can O
I O
tell O
you O
what O
I O
would. O
A O
very O
little O
more O
is O
all O
permitted O
to O
me. O
I O
cannot O
rest, O
I O
cannot O
stay, O
I O
cannot O
linger O
anywhere. O
My O
spirit O
never O
walked O
beyond O
our O
counting–house—mark O
me!—in O
life O
my O
spirit O
never O
roved O
beyond O
the O
narrow O
limits O
of O
our O
money–changing O
hole; O
and O
weary O
journeys O
lie O
before O
me!" O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
It O
was O
a O
habit O
with O
Scrooge, O
whenever O
he O
became O
thoughtful, O
to O
put O
his O
hands O
in O
his O
breeches O
pockets. O
Pondering O
on O
what O
the O
Ghost O
had O
said, O
he O
did O
so O
now, O
but O
without O
lifting O
up O
his O
eyes, O
or O
getting O
off O
his O
knees. O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
"You O
must O
have O
been O
very O
slow O
about O
it, O
Jacob", O
Scrooge O
observed, O
in O
a O
business–like O
manner, O
though O
with O
humility O
and O
deference. O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
"Slow!", O
the O
Ghost O
repeated. O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
"Seven O
years O
dead", O
mused O
Scrooge. O
"And O
travelling O
all O
the O
time!" O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
"The O
whole O
time", O
said O
the O
Ghost. O
"No O
rest, O
no O
peace. O
Incessant O
torture O
of O
remorse." O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
"You O
travel O
fast?", O
said O
Scrooge. O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
"On O
the O
wings O
of O
the O
wind", O
replied O
the O
Ghost. O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
"You O
might O
have O
got O
over O
a O
great O
quantity O
of O
ground O
in O
seven O
years", O
said O
Scrooge. O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
The O
Ghost, O
on O
hearing O
this, O
set O
up O
another O
cry, O
and O
clanked O
its O
chain O
so O
hideously O
in O
the O
dead O
silence O
of O
the O
night, O
that O
the O
Ward O
would O
have O
been O
justified O
in O
indicting O
it O
for O
a O
nuisance. O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
"Oh, O
captive, O
bound, O
and O
double–ironed", O
cried O
the O
phantom, O
"not O
to O
know, O
that O
ages O
of O
incessant O
labour O
by O
immortal O
creatures, O
for O
this O
earth O
must O
pass O
into O
eternity O
before O
the O
good O
of O
which O
it O
is O
susceptible O
is O
all O
developed. O
Not O
to O
know O
that O
any O
Christian O
spirit O
working O
kindly O
in O
its O
little O
sphere, O
whatever O
it O
may O
be, O
will O
find O
its O
mortal O
life O
too O
short O
for O
its O
vast O
means O
of O
usefulness. O
Not O
to O
know O
that O
no O
space O
of O
regret O
can O
make O
amends O
for O
one O
life's O
opportunity O
misused! O
Yet O
such O
was O
I! O
Oh! O
such O
was O
I!" O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
"But O
you O
were O
always O
a O
good O
man O
of O
business, O
Jacob", O
faltered O
Scrooge, O
who O
now O
began O
to O
apply O
this O
to O
himself. O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
"Business!", O
cried O
the O
Ghost, O
wringing O
its O
hands O
again. O
"Mankind O
was O
my O
business. O
The O
common O
welfare O
was O
my O
business; O
charity, O
mercy, O
forbearance, O
and O
benevolence, O
were, O
all, O
my O
business. O
The O
dealings O
of O
my O
trade O
were O
but O
a O
drop O
of O
water O
in O
the O
comprehensive O
ocean O
of O
my O
business!" O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
It O
held O
up O
its O
chain O
at O
arm's O
length, O
as O
if O
that O
were O
the O
cause O
of O
all O
its O
unavailing O
grief, O
and O
flung O
it O
heavily O
upon O
the O
ground O
again. O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
"At O
this O
time O
of O
the O
rolling O
year", O
the O
spectre O
said, O
"I O
suffer O
most. O
Why O
did O
I O
walk O
through O
crowds O
of O
fellow–beings O
with O
my O
eyes O
turned O
down, O
and O
never O
raise O
them O
to O
that O
blessed O
Star O
which O
led O
the O
Wise O
Men O
to O
a O
poor O
abode! O
Were O
there O
no O
poor O
homes O
to O
which O
its O
light O
would O
have O
conducted O
me!" O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
Scrooge O
was O
very O
much O
dismayed O
to O
hear O
the O
spectre O
going O
on O
at O
this O
rate, O
and O
began O
to O
quake O
exceedingly. O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
"Hear O
me!", O
cried O
the O
Ghost. O
"My O
time O
is O
nearly O
gone." O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
"I O
will", O
said O
Scrooge. O
"But O
don't O
be O
hard O
upon O
me! O
Don't O
be O
flowery, O
Jacob! O
Pray!" O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
"How O
it O
is O
that O
I O
appear O
before O
you O
in O
a O
shape O
that O
you O
can O
see, O
I O
may O
not O
tell. O
I O
have O
sat O
invisible O
beside O
you O
many O
and O
many O
a O
day." O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
It O
was O
not O
an O
agreeable O
idea. O
Scrooge O
shivered, O
and O
wiped O
the O
perspiration O
from O
his O
brow. O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
"That O
is O
no O
light O
part O
of O
my O
penance", O
pursued O
the O
Ghost. O
"I O
am O
here O
tonight O
to O
warn O
you, O
that O
you O
have O
yet O
a O
chance O
and O
hope O
of O
escaping O
my O
fate. O
A O
chance O
and O
hope O
of O
my O
procuring, O
Ebenezer." O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
"You O
were O
always O
a O
good O
friend O
to O
me", O
said O
Scrooge. O
"Thank'ee!" O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
"You O
will O
be O
haunted", O
resumed O
the O
Ghost, O
"by O
three O
spirits." O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
Scrooge's O
countenance O
fell O
almost O
as O
low O
as O
the O
Ghost's O
had O
done. O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
"Is O
that O
the O
chance O
and O
hope O
you O
mentioned, O
Jacob?", O
he O
demanded, O
in O
a O
faltering O
voice. O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
"It O
is." O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
"I—I O
think O
I'd O
rather O
not", O
said O
Scrooge. O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
"Without O
their O
visits", O
said O
the O
Ghost, O
"you O
cannot O
hope O
to O
shun O
the O
path O
I O
tread. O
Expect O
the O
first O
tomorrow, O
when O
the O
bell O
tolls O
one." O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
"Couldn't O
I O
take O
'em O
all O
at O
once, O
and O
have O
it O
over, O
Jacob?", O
hinted O
Scrooge. O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
"Expect O
the O
second O
on O
the O
next O
night O
at O
the O
same O
hour. O
The O
third O
upon O
the O
next O
night O
when O
the O
last O
stroke O
of O
twelve O
has O
ceased O
to O
vibrate. O
Look O
to O
see O
me O
no O
more; O
and O
look O
that, O
for O
your O
own O
sake, O
you O
remember O
what O
has O
passed O
between O
us!" O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
When O
it O
had O
said O
these O
words, O
the O
spectre O
took O
its O
wrapper O
from O
the O
table, O
and O
bound O
it O
round O
its O
head, O
as O
before. O
Scrooge O
knew O
this, O
by O
the O
smart O
sound O
its O
teeth O
made, O
when O
the O
jaws O
were O
brought O
together O
by O
the O
bandage. O
He O
ventured O
to O
raise O
his O
eyes O
again, O
and O
found O
his O
supernatural O
visitor O
confronting O
him O
in O
an O
erect O
attitude, O
with O
its O
chain O
wound O
over O
and O
about O
its O
arm. O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
The O
apparition O
walked O
backward O
from O
him; O
and O
at O
every O
step O
it O
took, O
the O
window O
raised O
itself O
a O
little, O
so O
that O
when O
the O
spectre O
reached O
it, O
it O
was O
wide O
open. O
It O
beckoned O
Scrooge O
to O
approach, O
which O
he O
did. O
When O
they O
were O
within O
two O
paces O
of O
each O
other, O
Marley's O
Ghost O
held O
up O
its O
hand, O
warning O
him O
to O
come O
no O
nearer. O
Scrooge O
stopped. O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
Not O
so O
much O
in O
obedience, O
as O
in O
surprise O
and O
fear: O
for O
on O
the O
raising O
of O
the O
hand, O
he O
became O
sensible O
of O
confused O
noises O
in O
the O
air; O
incoherent O
sounds O
of O
lamentation O
and O
regret; O
wailings O
inexpressibly O
sorrowful O
and O
self–accusatory. O
The O
spectre, O
after O
listening O
for O
a O
moment, O
joined O
in O
the O
mournful O
dirge; O
and O
floated O
out O
upon O
the O
bleak, O
dark O
night. O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
Scrooge O
followed O
to O
the O
window: O
desperate O
in O
his O
curiosity. O
He O
looked O
out. O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
The O
air O
was O
filled O
with O
phantoms, O
wandering O
hither O
and O
thither O
in O
restless O
haste, O
and O
moaning O
as O
they O
went. O
Every O
one O
of O
them O
wore O
chains O
like O
Marley's O
Ghost; O
some O
few O
(they O
might O
be O
guilty O
governments) O
were O
linked O
together; O
none O
were O
free. O
Many O
had O
been O
personally O
known O
to O
Scrooge O
in O
their O
lives. O
He O
had O
been O
quite O
familiar O
with O
one O
old O
ghost, O
in O
a O
white O
waistcoat, O
with O
a O
monstrous O
iron O
safe O
attached O
to O
its O
ankle, O
who O
cried O
piteously O
at O
being O
unable O
to O
assist O
a O
wretched O
woman O
with O
an O
infant, O
whom O
it O
saw O
below, O
upon O
a O
door–step. O
The O
misery O
with O
them O
all O
was, O
clearly, O
that O
they O
sought O
to O
interfere, O
for O
good, O
in O
human O
matters, O
and O
had O
lost O
the O
power O
for O
ever. O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
Whether O
these O
creatures O
faded O
into O
mist, O
or O
mist O
enshrouded O
them, O
he O
could O
not O
tell. O
But O
they O
and O
their O
spirit O
voices O
faded O
together; O
and O
the O
night O
became O
as O
it O
had O
been O
when O
he O
walked O
home. O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
 O
Scrooge O
closed O
the O
window, O
and O
examined O
the O
door O
by O
which O
the O
Ghost O
had O
entered. O
It O
was O
double–locked, O
as O
he O
had O
locked O
it O
with O
his O
own O
hands, O
and O
the O
bolts O
were O
undisturbed. O
He O
tried O
to O
say O
"Humbug!" O
but O
stopped O
at O
the O
first O
syllable. O
And O
being, O
from O
the O
emotion O
he O
had O
undergone, O
or O
the O
fatigues O
of O
the O
day, O
or O
his O
glimpse O
of O
the O
Invisible O
World, O
or O
the O
dull O
conversation O
of O
the O
Ghost, O
or O
the O
lateness O
of O
the O
hour, O
much O
in O
need O
of O
repose; O
went O
straight O
to O
bed, O
without O
undressing, O
and O
fell O
asleep O
upon O
the O
instant. O
When O
Scrooge O
awoke, O
it O
was O
so O
dark, O
that O
looking O
out O
of O
bed, O
he O
could O
scarcely O
distinguish O
the O
transparent O
window O
from O
the O
opaque O
walls O
of O
his O
chamber. O
He O
was O
endeavouring O
to O
pierce O
the O
darkness O
with O
his O
ferret O
eyes, O
when O
the O
chimes O
of O
a O
neighbouring O
church O
struck O
the O
four O
quarters. O
So O
he O
listened O
for O
the O
hour. O
To O
his O
great O
astonishment O
the O
heavy O
bell O
went O
on O
from O
six O
to O
seven, O
and O
from O
seven O
to O
eight, O
and O
regularly O
up O
to O
twelve; O
then O
stopped. O
Twelve! O
It O
was O
past O
two O
when O
he O
went O
to O
bed. O
The O
clock O
was O
wrong. O
An O
icicle O
must O
have O
got O
into O
the O
works. O
Twelve! O
He O
touched O
the O
spring O
of O
his O
repeater, O
to O
correct O
this O
most O
preposterous O
clock. O
Its O
rapid O
little O
pulse O
beat O
twelve; O
and O
stopped. O
"Why, O
it O
isn't O
possible," O
said O
Scrooge, O
"that O
I O
can O
have O
slept O
through O
a O
whole O
day O
and O
far O
into O
another O
night. O
It O
isn't O
possible O
that O
anything O
has O
happened O
to O
the O
sun, O
and O
this O
is O
twelve O
at O
noon!" O
The O
idea O
being O
an O
alarming O
one, O
he O
scrambled O
out O
of O
bed, O
and O
groped O
his O
way O
to O
the O
window. O
He O
was O
obliged O
to O
rub O
the O
frost O
off O
with O
the O
sleeve O
of O
his O
dressing-gown O
before O
he O
could O
see O
anything; O
and O
could O
see O
very O
little O
then. O
All O
he O
could O
make O
out O
was, O
that O
it O
was O
still O
very O
foggy O
and O
extremely O
cold, O
and O
that O
there O
was O
no O
noise O
of O
people O
running O
to O
and O
fro, O
and O
making O
a O
great O
stir, O
as O
there O
unquestionably O
would O
have O
been O
if O
night O
had O
beaten O
off O
bright O
day, O
and O
taken O
possession O
of O
the O
world. O
This O
was O
a O
great O
relief, O
because O
"three O
days O
after O
sight O
of O
this O
First O
of O
Exchange O
pay O
to O
Mr. O
Ebenezer O
Scrooge O
or O
his O
order," O
and O
so O
forth, O
would O
have O
become O
a O
mere O
United O
States' O
security O
if O
there O
were O
no O
days O
to O
count O
by. O
Scrooge O
went O
to O
bed O
again, O
and O
thought, O
and O
thought, O
and O
thought O
it O
over O
and O
over O
and O
over, O
and O
could O
make O
nothing O
of O
it. O
The O
more O
he O
thought, O
the O
more O
perplexed O
he O
was; O
and O
the O
more O
he O
endeavoured O
not O
to O
think, O
the O
more O
he O
thought. O
Marley's O
Ghost O
bothered O
him O
exceedingly. O
Every O
time O
he O
resolved O
within O
himself, O
after O
mature O
inquiry, O
that O
it O
was O
all O
a O
dream, O
his O
mind O
flew O
back O
again, O
like O
a O
strong O
spring O
released, O
to O
its O
first O
position, O
and O
presented O
the O
same O
problem O
to O
be O
worked O
all O
through, O
"Was O
it O
a O
dream O
or O
not?" O
Scrooge O
lay O
in O
this O
state O
until O
the O
chimes O
had O
gone O
three O
quarters O
more, O
when O
he O
remembered, O
on O
a O
sudden, O
that O
the O
Ghost O
had O
warned O
him O
of O
a O
visitation O
when O
the O
bell O
tolled O
one. O
He O
resolved O
to O
lie O
awake O
until O
the O
hour O
was O
past; O
and, O
considering O
that O
he O
could O
no O
more O
go O
to O
sleep O
than O
go O
to O
Heaven, O
this O
was O
perhaps O
the O
wisest O
resolution O
in O
his O
power. O
The O
quarter O
was O
so O
long, O
that O
he O
was O
more O
than O
once O
convinced O
he O
must O
have O
sunk O
into O
a O
doze O
unconsciously, O
and O
missed O
the O
clock. O
At O
length O
it O
broke O
upon O
his O
listening O
ear. O
"Ding, O
dong!" O
"A O
quarter O
past," O
said O
Scrooge, O
counting. O
"Ding, O
dong!" O
"Half O
past!" O
said O
Scrooge. O
"Ding, O
dong!" O
"A O
quarter O
to O
it," O
said O
Scrooge. O
"Ding, O
dong!" O
"The O
hour O
itself," O
said O
Scrooge, O
triumphantly, O
"and O
nothing O
else!" O
He O
spoke O
before O
the O
hour O
bell O
sounded, O
which O
it O
now O
did O
with O
a O
deep, O
dull, O
hollow, O
melancholy O
One. O
Light O
flashed O
up O
in O
the O
room O
upon O
the O
instant, O
and O
the O
curtains O
of O
his O
bed O
were O
drawn. O
The O
curtains O
of O
his O
bed O
were O
drawn O
aside, O
I O
tell O
you, O
by O
a O
hand. O
Not O
the O
curtains O
at O
his O
feet, O
nor O
the O
curtains O
at O
his O
back, O
but O
those O
to O
which O
his O
face O
was O
addressed. O
The O
curtains O
of O
his O
bed O
were O
drawn O
aside; O
and O
Scrooge, O
starting O
up O
into O
a O
half-recumbent O
attitude, O
found O
himself O
face O
to O
face O
with O
the O
unearthly O
visitor O
who O
drew O
them: O
as O
close O
to O
it O
as O
I O
am O
now O
to O
you, O
and O
I O
am O
standing O
in O
the O
spirit O
at O
your O
elbow. O
It O
was O
a O
strange O
figure—like O
a O
child: O
yet O
not O
so O
like O
a O
child O
as O
like O
an O
old O
man, O
viewed O
through O
some O
supernatural O
medium, O
which O
gave O
him O
the O
appearance O
of O
having O
receded O
from O
the O
view, O
and O
being O
diminished O
to O
a O
child's O
proportions. O
Its O
hair, O
which O
hung O
about O
its O
neck O
and O
down O
its O
back, O
was O
white O
as O
if O
with O
age; O
and O
yet O
the O
face O
had O
not O
a O
wrinkle O
in O
it, O
and O
the O
tenderest O
bloom O
was O
on O
the O
skin. O
The O
arms O
were O
very O
long O
and O
muscular; O
the O
hands O
the O
same, O
as O
if O
its O
hold O
were O
of O
uncommon O
strength. O
Its O
legs O
and O
feet, O
most O
delicately O
formed, O
were, O
like O
those O
upper O
members, O
bare. O
It O
wore O
a O
tunic O
of O
the O
purest O
white; O
and O
round O
its O
waist O
was O
bound O
a O
lustrous O
belt, O
the O
sheen O
of O
which O
was O
beautiful. O
It O
held O
a O
branch O
of O
fresh O
green O
holly O
in O
its O
hand; O
and, O
in O
singular O
contradiction O
of O
that O
wintry O
emblem, O
had O
its O
dress O
trimmed O
with O
summer O
flowers. O
But O
the O
strangest O
thing O
about O
it O
was, O
that O
from O
the O
crown O
of O
its O
head O
there O
sprung O
a O
bright O
clear O
jet O
of O
light, O
by O
which O
all O
this O
was O
visible; O
and O
which O
was O
doubtless O
the O
occasion O
of O
its O
using, O
in O
its O
duller O
moments, O
a O
great O
extinguisher O
for O
a O
cap, O
which O
it O
now O
held O
under O
its O
arm. O
Even O
this, O
though, O
when O
Scrooge O
looked O
at O
it O
with O
increasing O
steadiness, O
was O
not O
its O
strangest O
quality. O
For O
as O
its O
belt O
sparkled O
and O
glittered O
now O
in O
one O
part O
and O
now O
in O
another, O
and O
what O
was O
light O
one O
instant, O
at O
another O
time O
was O
dark, O
so O
the O
figure O
itself O
fluctuated O
in O
its O
distinctness: O
being O
now O
a O
thing O
with O
one O
arm, O
now O
with O
one O
leg, O
now O
with O
twenty O
legs, O
now O
a O
pair O
of O
legs O
without O
a O
head, O
now O
a O
head O
without O
a O
body: O
of O
which O
dissolving O
parts, O
no O
outline O
would O
be O
visible O
in O
the O
dense O
gloom O
wherein O
they O
melted O
away. O
And O
in O
the O
very O
wonder O
of O
this, O
it O
would O
be O
itself O
again; O
distinct O
and O
clear O
as O
ever. O
"Are O
you O
the O
Spirit, O
sir, O
whose O
coming O
was O
foretold O
to O
me?" O
asked O
Scrooge. O
"I O
am!" O
The O
voice O
was O
soft O
and O
gentle. O
Singularly O
low, O
as O
if O
instead O
of O
being O
so O
close O
beside O
him, O
it O
were O
at O
a O
distance. O
"Who, O
and O
what O
are O
you?" O
Scrooge O
demanded. O
"I O
am O
the O
Ghost O
of O
Christmas O
Past." O
"Long O
past?" O
inquired O
Scrooge: O
observant O
of O
its O
dwarfish O
stature. O
"No. O
Your O
past." O
Perhaps, O
Scrooge O
could O
not O
have O
told O
anybody O
why, O
if O
anybody O
could O
have O
asked O
him; O
but O
he O
had O
a O
special O
desire O
to O
see O
the O
Spirit O
in O
his O
cap; O
and O
begged O
him O
to O
be O
covered. O
"What!" O
exclaimed O
the O
Ghost, O
"would O
you O
so O
soon O
put O
out, O
with O
worldly O
hands, O
the O
light O
I O
give? O
Is O
it O
not O
enough O
that O
you O
are O
one O
of O
those O
whose O
passions O
made O
this O
cap, O
and O
force O
me O
through O
whole O
trains O
of O
years O
to O
wear O
it O
low O
upon O
my O
brow!" O
Scrooge O
reverently O
disclaimed O
all O
intention O
to O
offend, O
or O
any O
knowledge O
of O
having O
wilfully O
"bonneted" O
the O
Spirit O
at O
any O
period O
of O
his O
life. O
He O
then O
made O
bold O
to O
inquire O
what O
business O
brought O
him O
there. O
"Your O
welfare!" O
said O
the O
Ghost. O
Scrooge O
expressed O
himself O
much O
obliged, O
but O
could O
not O
help O
thinking O
that O
a O
night O
of O
unbroken O
rest O
would O
have O
been O
more O
conducive O
to O
that O
end. O
The O
Spirit O
must O
have O
heard O
him O
thinking, O
for O
it O
said O
immediately: O
"Your O
reclamation, O
then. O
Take O
heed!" O
It O
put O
out O
its O
strong O
hand O
as O
it O
spoke, O
and O
clasped O
him O
gently O
by O
the O
arm. O
"Rise! O
and O
walk O
with O
me!" O
It O
would O
have O
been O
in O
vain O
for O
Scrooge O
to O
plead O
that O
the O
weather O
and O
the O
hour O
were O
not O
adapted O
to O
pedestrian O
purposes; O
that O
bed O
was O
warm, O
and O
the O
thermometer O
a O
long O
way O
below O
freezing; O
that O
he O
was O
clad O
but O
lightly O
in O
his O
slippers, O
dressing-gown, O
and O
nightcap; O
and O
that O
he O
had O
a O
cold O
upon O
him O
at O
that O
time. O
The O
grasp, O
though O
gentle O
as O
a O
woman's O
hand, O
was O
not O
to O
be O
resisted. O
He O
rose: O
but O
finding O
that O
the O
Spirit O
made O
towards O
the O
window, O
clasped O
its O
robe O
in O
supplication. O
"I O
am O
a O
mortal," O
Scrooge O
remonstrated, O
"and O
liable O
to O
fall." O
"Bear O
but O
a O
touch O
of O
my O
hand O
there," O
said O
the O
Spirit, O
laying O
it O
upon O
his O
heart, O
"and O
you O
shall O
be O
upheld O
in O
more O
than O
this!" O
As O
the O
words O
were O
spoken, O
they O
passed O
through O
the O
wall, O
and O
stood O
upon O
an O
open O
country O
road, O
with O
fields O
on O
either O
hand. O
The O
city O
had O
entirely O
vanished. O
Not O
a O
vestige O
of O
it O
was O
to O
be O
seen. O
The O
darkness O
and O
the O
mist O
had O
vanished O
with O
it, O
for O
it O
was O
a O
clear, O
cold, O
winter O
day, O
with O
snow O
upon O
the O
ground. O
"Good O
Heaven!" O
said O
Scrooge, O
clasping O
his O
hands O
together, O
as O
he O
looked O
about O
him. O
"I O
was O
bred O
in O
this O
place. O
I O
was O
a O
boy O
here!" O
The O
Spirit O
gazed O
upon O
him O
mildly. O
Its O
gentle O
touch, O
though O
it O
had O
been O
light O
and O
instantaneous, O
appeared O
still O
present O
to O
the O
old O
man's O
sense O
of O
feeling. O
He O
was O
conscious O
of O
a O
thousand O
odours O
floating O
in O
the O
air, O
each O
one O
connected O
with O
a O
thousand O
thoughts, O
and O
hopes, O
and O
joys, O
and O
cares O
long, O
long, O
forgotten! O
"Your O
lip O
is O
trembling," O
said O
the O
Ghost. O
"And O
what O
is O
that O
upon O
your O
cheek?" O
Scrooge O
muttered, O
with O
an O
unusual O
catching O
in O
his O
voice, O
that O
it O
was O
a O
pimple; O
and O
begged O
the O
Ghost O
to O
lead O
him O
where O
he O
would. O
"You O
recollect O
the O
way?" O
inquired O
the O
Spirit. O
"Remember O
it!" O
cried O
Scrooge O
with O
fervour—"I O
could O
walk O
it O
blindfold." O
"Strange O
to O
have O
forgotten O
it O
for O
so O
many O
years!" O
observed O
the O
Ghost. O
"Let O
us O
go O
on." O
They O
walked O
along O
the O
road; O
Scrooge O
recognising O
every O
gate, O
and O
post, O
and O
tree; O
until O
a O
little O
market-town O
appeared O
in O
the O
distance, O
with O
its O
bridge, O
its O
church, O
and O
winding O
river. O
Some O
shaggy O
ponies O
now O
were O
seen O
trotting O
towards O
them O
with O
boys O
upon O
their O
backs, O
who O
called O
to O
other O
boys O
in O
country O
gigs O
and O
carts, O
driven O
by O
farmers. O
All O
these O
boys O
were O
in O
great O
spirits, O
and O
shouted O
to O
each O
other, O
until O
the O
broad O
fields O
were O
so O
full O
of O
merry O
music, O
that O
the O
crisp O
air O
laughed O
to O
hear O
it. O
"These O
are O
but O
shadows O
of O
the O
things O
that O
have O
been," O
said O
the O
Ghost. O
"They O
have O
no O
consciousness O
of O
us." O
The O
jocund O
travellers O
came O
on; O
and O
as O
they O
came, O
Scrooge O
knew O
and O
named O
them O
every O
one. O
"Why O
was O
he O
rejoiced O
beyond O
all O
bounds O
to O
see O
them! O
Why O
did O
his O
cold O
eye O
glisten, O
and O
his O
heart O
leap O
up O
as O
they O
went O
past! O
Why O
was O
he O
filled O
with O
gladness O
when O
he O
heard O
them O
give O
each O
other O
Merry O
Christmas, O
as O
they O
parted O
at O
cross-roads O
and-bye O
ways, O
for O
their O
several O
homes! O
What O
was O
merry O
Christmas O
to O
Scrooge? O
Out O
upon O
merry O
Christmas! O
What O
good O
had O
it O
ever O
done O
to O
him? O
"The O
school O
is O
not O
quite O
deserted," O
said O
the O
Ghost. O
"A O
solitary O
child, O
neglected O
by O
his O
friends, O
is O
left O
there O
still." O
Scrooge O
said O
he O
knew O
it. O
And O
he O
sobbed. O
They O
left O
the O
high-road, O
by O
a O
well O
remembered O
lane, O
and O
soon O
approached O
a O
mansion O
of O
dull O
red O
brick, O
with O
a O
little O
weathercock-surmounted O
cupola, O
on O
the O
roof, O
and O
a O
bell O
hanging O
in O
it. O
It O
was O
a O
large O
house, O
but O
one O
of O
broken O
fortunes; O
for O
the O
spacious O
offices O
were O
little O
used, O
their O
walls O
were O
damp O
and O
mossy, O
their O
windows O
broken, O
and O
their O
gates O
decayed. O
Fowls O
clucked O
and O
strutted O
in O
the O
stables; O
and O
the O
coach-houses O
and O
sheds O
were O
overrun O
with O
grass. O
Nor O
was O
it O
more O
retentive O
of O
its O
ancient O
state, O
within; O
for O
entering O
the O
dreary O
hall, O
and O
glancing O
through O
the O
open O
doors O
of O
many O
rooms, O
they O
found O
them O
poorly O
furnished, O
cold, O
and O
vast. O
There O
was O
an O
earthy O
savour O
in O
the O
air, O
a O
chilly O
bareness O
in O
the O
place, O
which O
associated O
itself O
somehow O
with O
too O
much O
getting O
up O
by O
candle-light, O
and O
not O
too O
much O
to O
eat. O
They O
went, O
the O
Ghost O
and O
Scrooge, O
across O
the O
hall, O
to O
a O
door O
at O
the O
back O
of O
the O
house. O
It O
opened O
before O
them, O
and O
disclosed O
a O
long, O
bare, O
melancholy O
room, O
made O
barer O
still O
by O
lines O
of O
plain O
deal O
forms O
and O
desks. O
At O
one O
of O
these O
a O
lonely O
boy O
was O
reading O
near O
a O
feeble O
fire; O
and O
Scrooge O
sat O
down O
upon O
a O
form, O
and O
wept O
to O
see O
his O
poor O
forgotten O
self O
as O
he O
had O
used O
to O
be. O
Not O
a O
latent O
echo O
in O
the O
house, O
not O
a O
squeak O
and O
scuffle O
from O
the O
mice O
behind O
the O
panelling, O
not O
a O
drip O
from O
the O
half-thawed O
water-spout O
in O
the O
dull O
yard O
behind, O
not O
a O
sigh O
among O
the O
leafless O
boughs O
of O
one O
despondent O
poplar, O
not O
the O
idle O
swinging O
of O
an O
empty O
store-house O
door, O
no, O
not O
a O
clicking O
in O
the O
fire, O
but O
fell O
upon O
the O
heart O
of O
Scrooge O
with O
softening O
influence, O
and O
gave O
a O
freer O
passage O
to O
his O
tears. O
The O
Spirit O
touched O
him O
on O
the O
arm, O
and O
pointed O
to O
his O
younger O
self, O
intent O
upon O
his O
reading. O
Suddenly O
a O
man, O
in O
foreign O
garments: O
wonderfully O
real O
and O
distinct O
to O
look O
at: O
stood O
outside O
the O
window, O
with O
an O
axe O
stuck O
in O
his O
belt, O
and O
leading O
an O
ass O
laden O
with O
wood O
by O
the O
bridle. O
"Why, O
it's O
Ali O
Baba!" O
Scrooge O
exclaimed O
in O
ecstacy. O
"It's O
dear O
old O
honest O
Ali O
Baba! O
Yes, O
yes, O
I O
know! O
One O
Christmas O
time, O
when O
yonder O
solitary O
child O
was O
left O
here O
all O
alone, O
he O
did O
come, O
for O
the O
first O
time, O
just O
like O
that. O
Poor O
boy! O
And O
Valentine," O
said O
Scrooge, O
"and O
his O
wild O
brother, O
Orson; O
there O
they O
go! O
And O
what's O
his O
name, O
who O
was O
put O
down O
in O
his O
drawers, O
asleep, O
at O
the O
Gate O
of O
Damascus; O
don't O
you O
see O
him! O
And O
the O
Sultan's O
Groom O
turned O
upside-down O
by O
the O
Genii; O
there O
he O
is O
upon O
his O
head! O
Serve O
him O
right. O
I'm O
glad O
of O
it. O
What O
business O
had O
he O
to O
be O
married O
to O
the O
Princess!" O
To O
hear O
Scrooge O
expending O
all O
the O
earnestness O
of O
his O
nature O
on O
such O
subjects, O
in O
a O
most O
extraordinary O
voice O
between O
laughing O
and O
crying; O
and O
to O
see O
his O
heightened O
and O
excited O
face; O
would O
have O
been O
a O
surprise O
to O
his O
business O
friends O
in O
the O
city, O
indeed. O
"There's O
the O
Parrot!" O
cried O
Scrooge. O
"Green O
body O
and O
yellow O
tail, O
with O
a O
thing O
like O
a O
lettuce O
growing O
out O
of O
the O
top O
of O
his O
head; O
there O
he O
is! O
Poor O
Robin O
Crusoe, O
he O
called O
him, O
when O
he O
came O
home O
again O
after O
sailing O
round O
the O
island. O
'Poor O
Robin O
Crusoe, O
where O
have O
you O
been, O
Robin O
Crusoe?' O
The O
man O
thought O
he O
was O
dreaming, O
but O
he O
wasn't. O
It O
was O
the O
Parrot, O
you O
know. O
There O
goes O
Friday, O
running O
for O
his O
life O
to O
the O
little O
creek! O
Halloa! O
Hoop! O
Halloo!" O
Then, O
with O
a O
rapidity O
of O
transition O
very O
foreign O
to O
his O
usual O
character, O
he O
said, O
in O
pity O
for O
his O
former O
self, O
"Poor O
boy!" O
and O
cried O
again. O
"I O
wish," O
Scrooge O
muttered, O
putting O
his O
hand O
in O
his O
pocket, O
and O
looking O
about O
him, O
after O
drying O
his O
eyes O
with O
his O
cuff: O
"but O
it's O
too O
late O
now." O
"What O
is O
the O
matter?" O
asked O
the O
Spirit. O
"Nothing," O
said O
Scrooge. O
"Nothing. O
There O
was O
a O
boy O
singing O
a O
Christmas O
Carol O
at O
my O
door O
last O
night. O
I O
should O
like O
to O
have O
given O
him O
something: O
that's O
all." O
The O
Ghost O
smiled O
thoughtfully, O
and O
waved O
its O
hand: O
saying O
as O
it O
did O
so, O
"Let O
us O
see O
another O
Christmas!" O
Scrooge's O
former O
self O
grew O
larger O
at O
the O
words, O
and O
the O
room O
became O
a O
little O
darker O
and O
more O
dirty. O
The O
pannels O
shrunk, O
the O
windows O
cracked; O
fragments O
of O
plaster O
fell O
out O
of O
the O
ceiling, O
and O
the O
naked O
laths O
were O
shown O
instead: O
but O
how O
all O
this O
was O
brought O
about, O
Scrooge O
knew O
no O
more O
than O
you O
do. O
He O
only O
knew O
that O
it O
was O
quite O
correct; O
that O
everything O
had O
happened O
so; O
that O
there O
he O
was, O
alone O
again, O
when O
all O
the O
other O
boys O
had O
gone O
home O
for O
the O
jolly O
holidays. O
He O
was O
not O
reading O
now, O
but O
walking O
up O
and O
down O
despairingly. O
Scrooge O
looked O
at O
the O
Ghost, O
and O
with O
a O
mournful O
shaking O
of O
his O
head, O
glanced O
anxiously O
towards O
the O
door. O
It O
opened; O
and O
a O
little O
girl, O
much O
younger O
than O
the O
boy, O
came O
darting O
in, O
and O
putting O
her O
arms O
about O
his O
neck, O
and O
often O
kissing O
him, O
addressed O
him O
as O
her O
"Dear, O
dear O
brother." O
"I O
have O
come O
to O
bring O
you O
home, O
dear O
brother!" O
said O
the O
child, O
clapping O
her O
tiny O
hands, O
and O
bending O
down O
to O
laugh. O
"To O
bring O
you O
home, O
home, O
home!" O
"Home, O
little O
Fan?" O
returned O
the O
boy. O
"Yes!" O
said O
the O
child, O
brimful O
of O
glee, O
"Home, O
for O
good O
and O
all. O
Home, O
for O
ever O
and O
ever. O
Father O
is O
so O
much O
kinder O
than O
he O
used O
to O
be, O
that O
home's O
like O
Heaven! O
He O
spoke O
so O
gently O
to O
me O
one O
dear O
night O
when O
I O
was O
going O
to O
bed, O
that O
I O
was O
not O
afraid O
to O
ask O
him O
once O
more O
if O
you O
might O
come O
home; O
and O
he O
said O
Yes, O
you O
should; O
and O
sent O
me O
in O
a O
coach O
to O
bring O
you. O
And O
you're O
to O
be O
a O
man!" O
said O
the O
child, O
opening O
her O
eyes, O
"and O
are O
never O
to O
come O
back O
here; O
but O
first, O
we're O
to O
be O
together O
all O
the O
Christmas O
long, O
and O
have O
the O
merriest O
time O
in O
all O
the O
world." O
"You O
are O
quite O
a O
woman, O
little O
Fan!" O
exclaimed O
the O
boy. O
She O
clapped O
her O
hands O
and O
laughed, O
and O
tried O
to O
touch O
his O
head; O
but O
being O
too O
little, O
laughed O
again, O
and O
stood O
on O
tiptoe O
to O
embrace O
him. O
Then O
she O
began O
to O
drag O
him, O
in O
her O
childish O
eagerness, O
towards O
the O
door; O
and O
he, O
nothing O
loth O
to O
go, O
accompanied O
her. O
A O
terrible O
voice O
in O
the O
hall O
cried, O
"Bring O
down O
Master O
Scrooge's O
box, O
there!" O
and O
in O
the O
hall O
appeared O
the O
schoolmaster O
himself, O
who O
glared O
on O
Master O
Scrooge O
with O
a O
ferocious O
condescension, O
and O
threw O
him O
into O
a O
dreadful O
state O
of O
mind O
by O
shaking O
hands O
with O
him. O
He O
then O
conveyed O
him O
and O
his O
sister O
into O
the O
veriest O
old O
well O
of O
a O
shivering O
best-parlour O
that O
ever O
was O
seen, O
where O
the O
maps O
upon O
the O
wall, O
and O
the O
celestial O
and O
terrestrial O
globes O
in O
the O
windows, O
were O
waxy O
with O
cold. O
Here O
he O
produced O
a O
decanter O
of O
curiously O
light O
wine, O
and O
a O
block O
of O
curiously O
heavy O
cake, O
and O
administered O
instalments O
of O
those O
dainties O
to O
the O
young O
people: O
at O
the O
same O
time, O
sending O
out O
a O
meagre O
servant O
to O
offer O
a O
glass O
of O
"something" O
to O
the O
postboy, O
who O
answered O
that O
he O
thanked O
the O
gentleman, O
but O
if O
it O
was O
the O
same O
tap O
as O
he O
had O
tasted O
before, O
he O
had O
rather O
not. O
Master O
Scrooge's O
trunk O
being O
by O
this O
time O
tied O
on O
to O
the O
top O
of O
the O
chaise, O
the O
children O
bade O
the O
schoolmaster O
good-bye O
right O
willingly; O
and O
getting O
into O
it, O
drove O
gaily O
down O
the O
garden-sweep: O
the O
quick O
wheels O
dashing O
the O
hoar-frost O
and O
snow O
from O
off O
the O
dark O
leaves O
of O
the O
evergreens O
like O
spray. O
"Always O
a O
delicate O
creature, O
whom O
a O
breath O
might O
have O
withered," O
said O
the O
Ghost. O
"But O
she O
had O
a O
large O
heart!" O
"So O
she O
had," O
cried O
Scrooge. O
"You're O
right. O
I'll O
not O
gainsay O
it, O
Spirit. O
God O
forbid!" O
"She O
died O
a O
woman," O
said O
the O
Ghost," O
and O
had, O
as O
I O
think, O
children." O
"One O
child," O
Scrooge O
returned. O
"True," O
said O
the O
Ghost. O
"Your O
nephew!" O
Scrooge O
seemed O
uneasy O
in O
his O
mind; O
and O
answered O
briefly, O
"Yes." O
Although O
they O
had O
but O
that O
moment O
left O
the O
school O
behind O
them, O
they O
were O
now O
in O
the O
busy O
thoroughfares O
of O
a O
city, O
where O
shadowy O
passengers O
passed O
and O
repassed; O
where O
shadowy O
carts O
and O
coaches O
battled O
for O
the O
way, O
and O
all O
the O
strife O
and O
tumult O
of O
a O
real O
city O
were. O
It O
was O
made O
plain O
enough, O
by O
the O
dressing O
of O
the O
shops, O
that O
here O
too O
it O
was O
Christmas O
time O
again; O
but O
it O
was O
evening, O
and O
the O
streets O
were O
lighted O
up. O
The O
Ghost O
stopped O
at O
a O
certain O
warehouse O
door, O
and O
asked O
Scrooge O
if O
he O
knew O
it. O
"Know O
it!" O
said O
Scrooge. O
"Was O
I O
apprenticed O
here!" O
They O
went O
in. O
At O
sight O
of O
an O
old O
gentleman O
in O
a O
Welch O
wig, O
sitting O
behind O
such O
a O
high O
desk, O
that O
if O
he O
had O
been O
two O
inches O
taller O
he O
must O
have O
knocked O
his O
head O
against O
the O
ceiling, O
Scrooge O
cried O
in O
great O
excitement: O
"Why, O
it's O
old O
Fezziwig! O
Bless O
his O
heart; O
it's O
Fezziwig O
alive O
again!" O
Old O
Fezziwig O
laid O
down O
his O
pen O
and O
looked O
up O
at O
the O
clock, O
which O
pointed O
to O
the O
hour O
of O
seven. O
He O
rubbed O
his O
hands; O
adjusted O
his O
capacious O
waistcoat; O
laughed O
all O
over O
himself, O
from O
his O
shoes O
to O
his O
organ O
of O
benevolence; O
and O
called O
out O
in O
a O
comfortable, O
oily, O
rich, O
fat, O
jovial O
voice: O
"Yo O
ho, O
there! O
Ebenezer! O
Dick!" O
Scrooge's O
former O
self, O
now O
grown O
a O
young O
man, O
came O
briskly O
in, O
accompanied O
by O
his O
fellow-'prentice. O
"Dick O
Wilkins, O
to O
be O
sure!" O
said O
Scrooge O
to O
the O
Ghost. O
"Bless O
me, O
yes. O
There O
he O
is. O
He O
was O
very O
much O
attached O
to O
me, O
was O
Dick. O
Poor O
Dick! O
Dear, O
dear!" O
"Yo O
ho, O
my O
boys!" O
said O
Fezziwig. O
"No O
more O
work O
to-night. O
Christmas O
Eve, O
Dick. O
Christmas, O
Ebenezer! O
Let's O
have O
the O
shutters O
up," O
cried O
old O
Fezziwig, O
with O
a O
sharp O
clap O
of O
his O
hands, O
"before O
a O
man O
can O
say, O
Jack O
Robinson!" O
You O
wouldn't O
believe O
how O
those O
two O
fellows O
went O
at O
it! O
They O
charged O
into O
the O
street O
with O
the O
shutters—one, O
two, O
three—had O
'em O
up O
in O
their O
places—four, O
five, O
six—barred O
'em O
and O
pinned O
'em—seven, O
eight, O
nine—and O
came O
back O
before O
you O
could O
have O
got O
to O
twelve, O
panting O
like O
race-horses. O
"Hilli-ho!" O
cried O
old O
Fezziwig, O
skipping O
down O
from O
the O
high O
desk, O
with O
wonderful O
agility. O
"Clear O
away, O
my O
lads, O
and O
let's O
have O
lots O
of O
room O
here! O
Hilli-ho, O
Dick! O
Chirrup, O
Ebenezer!" O
Clear O
away! O
There O
was O
nothing O
they O
wouldn't O
have O
cleared O
away, O
or O
couldn't O
have O
cleared O
away, O
with O
old O
Fezziwig O
looking O
on. O
It O
was O
done O
in O
a O
minute. O
Every O
movable O
was O
packed O
off, O
as O
if O
it O
were O
dismissed O
from O
public O
life O
for O
evermore; O
the O
floor O
was O
swept O
and O
watered, O
the O
lamps O
were O
trimmed, O
fuel O
was O
heaped O
upon O
the O
fire; O
and O
the O
warehouse O
was O
as O
snug, O
and O
warm, O
and O
dry, O
and O
bright O
a O
ball-room, O
as O
you O
would O
desire O
to O
see O
upon O
a O
winter's O
night. O
In O
came O
a O
fiddler O
with O
a O
music-book, O
and O
went O
up O
to O
the O
lofty O
desk, O
and O
made O
an O
orchestra O
of O
it, O
and O
tuned O
like O
fifty O
stomach-aches. O
In O
came O
Mrs. O
Fezziwig, O
one O
vast O
substantial O
smile. O
In O
came O
the O
three O
Miss O
Fezziwigs, O
beaming O
and O
loveable. O
In O
came O
the O
six O
young O
followers O
whose O
hearts O
they O
broke. O
In O
came O
all O
the O
young O
men O
and O
women O
employed O
in O
the O
business. O
In O
came O
the O
housemaid, O
with O
her O
cousin, O
the O
baker. O
In O
came O
the O
cook, O
with O
her O
brother's O
particular O
friend, O
the O
milkman. O
In O
came O
the O
boy O
from O
over O
the O
way, O
who O
was O
suspected O
of O
not O
having O
board O
enough O
from O
his O
master; O
trying O
to O
hide O
himself O
behind O
the O
girl O
from O
next O
door O
but O
one, O
who O
was O
proved O
to O
have O
had O
her O
ears O
pulled O
by O
her O
Mistress. O
In O
they O
all O
came, O
one O
after O
another; O
some O
shyly, O
some O
boldly, O
some O
gracefully, O
some O
awkwardly, O
some O
pushing, O
some O
pulling; O
in O
they O
all O
came, O
anyhow O
and O
everyhow. O
Away O
they O
all O
went, O
twenty O
couple O
at O
once, O
hands O
half O
round O
and O
back O
again O
the O
other O
way; O
down O
the O
middle O
and O
up O
again; O
round O
and O
round O
in O
various O
stages O
of O
affectionate O
grouping; O
old O
top O
couple O
always O
turning O
up O
in O
the O
wrong O
place; O
new O
top O
couple O
starting O
off O
again, O
as O
soon O
as O
they O
got O
there; O
all O
top O
couples O
at O
last, O
and O
not O
a O
bottom O
one O
to O
help O
them. O
When O
this O
result O
was O
brought O
about, O
old O
Fezziwig, O
clapping O
his O
hands O
to O
stop O
the O
dance, O
cried O
out, O
"Well O
done!" O
and O
the O
fiddler O
plunged O
his O
hot O
face O
into O
a O
pot O
of O
porter, O
especially O
provided O
for O
that O
purpose. O
But O
scorning O
rest O
upon O
his O
reappearance, O
he O
instantly O
began O
again, O
though O
there O
were O
no O
dancers O
yet, O
as O
if O
the O
other O
fiddler O
had O
been O
carried O
home, O
exhausted, O
on O
a O
shutter; O
and O
he O
were O
a O
bran-new O
man O
resolved O
to O
beat O
him O
out O
of O
sight, O
or O
perish. O
There O
were O
more O
dances, O
and O
there O
were O
forfeits, O
and O
more O
dances, O
and O
there O
was O
cake, O
and O
there O
was O
negus, O
and O
there O
was O
a O
great O
piece O
of O
Cold O
Roast, O
and O
there O
was O
a O
great O
piece O
of O
Cold O
Boiled, O
and O
there O
were O
mince-pies, O
and O
plenty O
of O
beer. O
But O
the O
great O
effect O
of O
the O
evening O
came O
after O
the O
Roast O
and O
Boiled, O
when O
the O
fiddler O
(an O
artful O
dog, O
mind! O
The O
sort O
of O
man O
who O
knew O
his O
business O
better O
than O
you O
or O
I O
could O
have O
told O
it O
him!) O
struck O
up O
"Sir O
Roger O
de O
Coverley." O
Then O
old O
Fezziwig O
stood O
out O
to O
dance O
with O
Mrs. O
Fezziwig. O
Top O
couple O
too; O
with O
a O
good O
stiff O
piece O
of O
work O
cut O
out O
for O
them; O
three O
or O
four O
and O
twenty O
pair O
of O
partners; O
people O
who O
were O
not O
to O
be O
trifled O
with; O
people O
who O
would O
dance, O
and O
had O
no O
notion O
of O
walking. O
But O
if O
they O
had O
been O
twice O
as O
many: O
ah, O
four O
times: O
old O
Fezziwig O
would O
have O
been O
a O
match O
for O
them, O
and O
so O
would O
Mrs. O
Fezziwig. O
As O
to O
her, O
she O
was O
worthy O
to O
be O
his O
partner O
in O
every O
sense O
of O
the O
term. O
If O
that's O
not O
high O
praise, O
tell O
me O
higher, O
and O
I'll O
use O
it. O
A O
positive O
light O
appeared O
to O
issue O
from O
Fezziwig's O
calves. O
They O
shone O
in O
every O
part O
of O
the O
dance O
like O
moons. O
You O
couldn't O
have O
predicted, O
at O
any O
given O
time, O
what O
would O
become O
of O
'em O
next. O
And O
when O
old O
Fezziwig O
and O
Mrs. O
Fezziwig O
had O
gone O
all O
through O
the O
dance; O
advance O
and O
retire, O
hold O
hands O
with O
your O
partner; O
bow O
and O
curtsey; O
corkscrew; O
thread-the-needle, O
and O
back O
again O
to O
your O
place; O
Fezziwig O
"cut"—cut O
so O
deftly, O
that O
he O
appeared O
to O
wink O
with O
his O
legs, O
and O
came O
upon O
his O
feet O
again O
without O
a O
stagger. O
When O
the O
clock O
struck O
eleven, O
this O
domestic O
ball O
broke O
up. O
Mr. O
and O
Mrs. O
Fezziwig O
took O
their O
stations, O
one O
on O
either O
side O
the O
door, O
and O
shaking O
hands O
with O
every O
person O
individually O
as O
he O
or O
she O
went O
out, O
wished O
him O
or O
her O
a O
Merry O
Christmas. O
When O
everybody O
had O
retired O
but O
the O
two O
'prentices, O
they O
did O
the O
same O
to O
them; O
and O
thus O
the O
cheerful O
voices O
died O
away, O
and O
the O
lads O
were O
left O
to O
their O
beds; O
which O
were O
under O
a O
counter O
in O
the O
back-shop. O
During O
the O
whole O
of O
this O
time, O
Scrooge O
had O
acted O
like O
a O
man O
out O
of O
his O
wits. O
His O
heart O
and O
soul O
were O
in O
the O
scene, O
and O
with O
his O
former O
self. O
He O
corroborated O
everything, O
remembered O
everything, O
enjoyed O
everything, O
and O
underwent O
the O
strangest O
agitation. O
It O
was O
not O
until O
now, O
when O
the O
bright O
faces O
of O
his O
former O
self O
and O
Dick O
were O
turned O
from O
them, O
that O
he O
remembered O
the O
Ghost, O
and O
became O
conscious O
that O
it O
was O
looking O
full O
upon O
him, O
while O
the O
light O
upon O
its O
head O
burnt O
very O
clear. O
"A O
small O
matter," O
said O
the O
Ghost, O
"to O
make O
these O
silly O
folks O
so O
full O
of O
gratitude." O
"Small!" O
echoed O
Scrooge. O
The O
Spirit O
signed O
to O
him O
to O
listen O
to O
the O
two O
apprentices, O
who O
were O
pouring O
out O
their O
hearts O
in O
praise O
of O
Fezziwig: O
and O
when O
he O
had O
done O
so, O
said, O
"Why! O
Is O
it O
not? O
he O
has O
spent O
but O
a O
few O
pounds O
of O
your O
mortal O
money: O
three O
or O
four, O
perhaps. O
Is O
that O
so O
much O
that O
he O
deserves O
this O
praise?" O
"It O
isn't O
that," O
said O
Scrooge, O
heated O
by O
the O
remark, O
and O
speaking O
unconsciously O
like O
his O
former, O
not O
his O
latter, O
self. O
"It O
isn't O
that, O
Spirit, O
He O
has O
the O
power O
to O
render O
us O
happy O
or O
unhappy; O
to O
make O
our O
service O
light O
or O
burdensome; O
a O
pleasure O
or O
a O
toil. O
Say O
that O
his O
power O
lies O
in O
words O
and O
looks; O
in O
things O
so O
slight O
and O
insignificant O
that O
it O
is O
impossible O
to O
add O
and O
count O
'em O
up: O
what O
then? O
The O
happiness O
he O
gives, O
is O
quite O
as O
great O
as O
if O
it O
cost O
a O
fortune." O
He O
felt O
the O
Spirit's O
glance, O
and O
stopped. O
"What O
is O
the O
matter?" O
asked O
the O
Ghost. O
"Nothing O
particular," O
said O
Scrooge. O
"Something, O
I O
think?" O
the O
Ghost O
insisted. O
"No," O
said O
Scrooge, O
"No. O
I O
should O
like O
to O
be O
able O
to O
say O
a O
word O
or O
two O
to O
my O
clerk O
just O
now! O
That's O
all." O
His O
former O
self O
turned O
down O
the O
lamps O
as O
he O
gave O
utterance O
to O
the O
wish; O
and O
Scrooge O
and O
the O
Ghost O
again O
stood O
side O
by O
side O
in O
the O
open O
air. O
"My O
time O
grows O
short," O
observed O
the O
Spirit. O
"Quick!" O
This O
was O
not O
addressed O
to O
Scrooge, O
or O
to O
any O
one O
whom O
he O
could O
see, O
but O
it O
produced O
an O
immediate O
effect. O
For O
again O
Scrooge O
saw O
himself. O
He O
was O
older O
now; O
a O
man O
in O
the O
prime O
of O
life. O
His O
face O
had O
not O
the O
harsh O
and O
rigid O
lines O
of O
later O
years; O
but O
it O
had O
begun O
to O
wear O
the O
signs O
of O
care O
and O
avarice. O
There O
was O
an O
eager, O
greedy, O
restless O
motion O
in O
the O
eye, O
which O
showed O
the O
passion O
that O
had O
taken O
root, O
and O
where O
the O
shadow O
of O
the O
growing O
tree O
would O
fall. O
He O
was O
not O
alone, O
but O
sat O
by O
the O
side O
of O
a O
fair O
young O
girl O
in O
a O
mourning-dress: O
in O
whose O
eyes O
there O
were O
tears, O
which O
sparkled O
in O
the O
light O
that O
shone O
out O
of O
the O
Ghost O
of O
Christmas O
Past. O
"It O
matters O
little," O
she O
said, O
softly. O
"To O
you, O
very O
little. O
Another O
idol O
has O
displaced O
me; O
and O
if O
it O
can O
cheer O
and O
comfort O
you O
in O
time O
to O
come, O
as O
I O
would O
have O
tried O
to O
do, O
I O
have O
no O
just O
cause O
to O
grieve." O
"What O
Idol O
has O
displaced O
you?" O
he O
rejoined. O
"A O
golden O
one." O
"This O
is O
the O
even-handed O
dealing O
of O
the O
world!" O
he O
said. O
"There O
is O
nothing O
on O
which O
it O
is O
so O
hard O
as O
poverty; O
and O
there O
is O
nothing O
it O
professes O
to O
condemn O
with O
such O
severity O
as O
the O
pursuit O
of O
wealth!" O
"You O
fear O
the O
world O
too O
much," O
she O
answered, O
gently. O
"All O
your O
other O
hopes O
have O
merged O
into O
the O
hope O
of O
being O
beyond O
the O
chance O
of O
its O
sordid O
reproach. O
I O
have O
seen O
your O
nobler O
aspirations O
fall O
off O
one O
by O
one, O
until O
the O
master-passion, O
Gain, O
engrosses O
you. O
Have O
I O
not?" O
"What O
then?" O
he O
retorted. O
"Even O
if O
I O
have O
grown O
so O
much O
wiser, O
what O
then? O
I O
am O
not O
changed O
towards O
you." O
She O
shook O
her O
head. O
"Am O
I?" O
"Our O
contract O
is O
an O
old O
one. O
It O
was O
made O
when O
we O
were O
both O
poor O
and O
content O
to O
be O
so, O
until, O
in O
good O
season, O
we O
could O
improve O
our O
worldly O
fortune O
by O
our O
patient O
industry. O
You O
are O
changed. O
When O
it O
was O
made, O
you O
were O
another O
man." O
"I O
was O
a O
boy," O
he O
said O
impatiently. O
"Your O
own O
feeling O
tells O
you O
that O
you O
were O
not O
what O
you O
are," O
she O
returned. O
"I O
am. O
That O
which O
promised O
happiness O
when O
we O
were O
one O
in O
heart, O
is O
fraught O
with O
misery O
now O
that O
we O
are O
two. O
How O
often O
and O
how O
keenly O
I O
have O
thought O
of O
this, O
I O
will O
not O
say. O
It O
is O
enough O
that O
I O
have O
thought O
of O
it, O
and O
can O
release O
you." O
"Have O
I O
ever O
sought O
release?" O
"In O
words. O
No. O
Never." O
"In O
what, O
then?" O
"In O
a O
changed O
nature; O
in O
an O
altered O
spirit; O
in O
another O
atmosphere O
of O
life; O
another O
Hope O
as O
its O
great O
end. O
In O
everything O
that O
made O
my O
love O
of O
any O
worth O
or O
value O
in O
your O
sight. O
If O
this O
had O
never O
been O
between O
us," O
said O
the O
girl, O
looking O
mildly, O
but O
with O
steadiness, O
upon O
him; O
"tell O
me, O
would O
you O
seek O
me O
out O
and O
try O
to O
win O
me O
now? O
Ah, O
no!" O
He O
seemed O
to O
yield O
to O
the O
justice O
of O
this O
supposition, O
in O
spite O
of O
himself. O
But O
he O
said, O
with O
a O
struggle, O
"You O
think O
not." O
"O O
would O
gladly O
think O
otherwise O
if O
I O
could," O
she O
answered, O
"Heaven O
knows! O
When O
I O
have O
learned O
a O
Truth O
like O
this, O
I O
know O
how O
strong O
and O
irresistible O
it O
must O
be. O
But O
if O
you O
were O
free O
to-day, O
to-morrow, O
yesterday, O
can O
even O
I O
believe O
that O
you O
would O
choose O
a O
dowerless O
girl—you O
who, O
in O
your O
very O
confidence O
with O
her, O
weigh O
everything O
by O
Gain: O
or, O
choosing O
her, O
if O
for O
a O
moment O
you O
were O
false O
enough O
to O
your O
one O
guiding O
principle O
to O
do O
so, O
do O
I O
not O
know O
that O
your O
repentance O
and O
regret O
would O
surely O
follow? O
I O
do; O
and O
I O
release O
you. O
With O
a O
full O
heart, O
for O
the O
love O
of O
him O
you O
once O
were." O
He O
was O
about O
to O
speak; O
but O
with O
her O
head O
turned O
from O
him, O
she O
resumed. O
"You O
may—the O
memory O
of O
what O
is O
past O
half O
makes O
me O
hope O
you O
will—have O
pain O
in O
this. O
A O
very, O
very O
brief O
time, O
and O
you O
will O
dismiss O
the O
recollection O
of O
it, O
gladly, O
as O
an O
unprofitable O
dream, O
from O
which O
it O
happened O
well O
that O
you O
awoke. O
May O
you O
be O
happy O
in O
the O
life O
you O
have O
chosen!" O
She O
left O
him; O
and O
they O
parted. O
"Spirit!" O
said O
Scrooge, O
"show O
me O
no O
more! O
Conduct O
me O
home. O
Why O
do O
you O
delight O
to O
torture O
me?" O
"One O
shadow O
more!" O
exclaimed O
the O
Ghost. O
"No O
more!" O
cried O
Scrooge. O
"No O
more. O
I O
don't O
wish O
to O
see O
it. O
Show O
me O
no O
more!" O
But O
the O
relentless O
Ghost O
pinioned O
him O
in O
both O
his O
arms, O
and O
forced O
him O
to O
observe O
what O
happened O
next. O
They O
were O
in O
another O
scene O
and O
place: O
a O
room, O
not O
very O
large O
or O
handsome, O
but O
full O
of O
comfort. O
Near O
to O
the O
winter O
fire O
sat O
a O
beautiful O
young O
girl, O
so O
like O
the O
last O
that O
Scrooge O
believed O
it O
was O
the O
same, O
until O
he O
saw O
her, O
now O
a O
comely O
matron, O
sitting O
opposite O
her O
daughter. O
The O
noise O
in O
this O
room O
was O
perfectly O
tumultuous, O
for O
there O
were O
more O
children O
there, O
than O
Scrooge O
in O
his O
agitated O
state O
of O
mind O
could O
count; O
and, O
unlike O
the O
celebrated O
herd O
in O
the O
poem, O
they O
were O
not O
forty O
children O
conducting O
themselves O
like O
one, O
but O
every O
child O
was O
conducting O
itself O
like O
forty. O
The O
consequences O
were O
uproarious O
beyond O
belief; O
but O
no O
one O
seemed O
to O
care; O
on O
the O
contrary, O
the O
mother O
and O
daughter O
laughed O
heartily, O
and O
enjoyed O
it O
very O
much; O
and O
the O
latter, O
soon O
beginning O
to O
mingle O
in O
the O
sports, O
got O
pillaged O
by O
the O
young O
brigands O
most O
ruthlessly. O
What O
would O
I O
not O
have O
given O
to O
be O
one O
of O
them! O
Though O
I O
never O
could O
have O
been O
so O
rude, O
no, O
no! O
I O
wouldn't O
for O
the O
wealth O
of O
all O
the O
world O
have O
crushed O
that O
braided O
hair, O
and O
torn O
it O
down; O
and O
for O
the O
precious O
little O
shoe, O
I O
wouldn't O
have O
plucked O
it O
off, O
God O
bless O
my O
soul! O
to O
save O
my O
life. O
As O
to O
measuring O
her O
waist O
in O
sport, O
as O
they O
did, O
bold O
young O
brood, O
I O
couldn't O
have O
done O
it; O
I O
should O
have O
expected O
my O
arm O
to O
have O
grown O
round O
it O
for O
a O
punishment, O
and O
never O
come O
straight O
again. O
And O
yet O
I O
should O
have O
dearly O
liked, O
I O
own, O
to O
have O
touched O
her O
lips; O
to O
have O
questioned O
her, O
that O
she O
might O
have O
opened O
them; O
to O
have O
looked O
upon O
the O
lashes O
of O
her O
downcast O
eyes, O
and O
never O
raised O
a O
blush; O
to O
have O
let O
loose O
waves O
of O
hair, O
an O
inch O
of O
which O
would O
be O
a O
keepsake O
beyond O
price: O
in O
short, O
I O
should O
have O
liked, O
I O
do O
confess, O
to O
have O
had O
the O
lightest O
licence O
of O
a O
child, O
and O
yet O
been O
man O
enough O
to O
know O
its O
value. O
But O
now O
a O
knocking O
at O
the O
door O
was O
heard, O
and O
such O
a O
rush O
immediately O
ensued O
that O
she O
with O
laughing O
face O
and O
plundered O
dress O
was O
borne O
towards O
it O
the O
centre O
of O
a O
flushed O
and O
boisterous O
group, O
just O
in O
time O
to O
greet O
the O
father, O
who, O
came O
home O
attended O
by O
a O
man O
laden O
with O
Christmas O
toys O
and O
presents. O
Then O
the O
shouting O
and O
the O
struggling, O
and O
the O
onslaught O
that O
was O
made O
on O
the O
defenceless O
porter! O
The O
scaling O
him, O
with O
chairs O
for O
ladders, O
to O
dive O
into O
his O
pockets, O
despoil O
him O
of O
brown-paper O
parcels, O
hold O
on O
tight O
by O
his O
cravat, O
hug O
him O
round O
the O
neck, O
pommel O
his O
back, O
and O
kick O
his O
legs O
in O
irrepressible O
affection! O
The O
shouts O
of O
wonder O
and O
delight O
with O
which O
the O
development O
of O
every O
package O
was O
received! O
The O
terrible O
announcement O
that O
the O
baby O
had O
been O
taken O
in O
the O
act O
of O
putting O
a O
doll's O
frying-pan O
into O
his O
mouth, O
and O
was O
more O
than O
suspected O
of O
having O
swallowed O
a O
fictitious O
turkey, O
glued O
on O
a O
wooden O
platter! O
The O
immense O
relief O
of O
finding O
this O
a O
false O
alarm! O
The O
joy, O
and O
gratitude, O
and O
ecstacy! O
They O
are O
all O
indescribable O
alike. O
It O
is O
enough O
that O
by O
degrees O
the O
children O
and O
their O
emotions O
got O
out O
of O
the O
parlour O
and O
by O
one O
stair O
at O
a O
time, O
up O
to O
the O
top O
of O
the O
house; O
where O
they O
went O
to O
bed, O
and O
so O
subsided. O
And O
now O
Scrooge O
looked O
on O
more O
attentively O
than O
ever, O
when O
the O
master O
of O
the O
house, O
having O
his O
daughter O
leaning O
fondly O
on O
him, O
sat O
down O
with O
her O
and O
her O
mother O
at O
his O
own O
fireside; O
and O
when O
he O
thought O
that O
such O
another O
creature, O
quite O
as O
graceful O
and O
as O
full O
of O
promise, O
might O
have O
called O
him O
father, O
and O
been O
a O
spring-time O
in O
the O
haggard O
winter O
of O
his O
life, O
his O
sight O
grew O
very O
dim O
indeed. O
"Belle," O
said O
the O
husband, O
turning O
to O
his O
wife O
with O
a O
smile, O
"I O
saw O
an O
old O
friend O
of O
yours O
this O
afternoon." O
"Who O
was O
it?" O
"Guess!" O
"How O
can O
I? O
Tut, O
don't O
I O
know," O
she O
added O
in O
the O
same O
breath, O
laughing O
as O
he O
laughed. O
"Mr. O
Scrooge." O
"Mr. O
Scrooge O
it O
was. O
I O
passed O
his O
office O
window; O
and O
as O
it O
was O
not O
shut O
up, O
and O
he O
had O
a O
candle O
inside, O
I O
could O
scarcely O
help O
seeing O
him. O
His O
partner O
lies O
upon O
the O
point O
of O
death, O
I O
hear; O
and O
there O
he O
sat O
alone. O
Quite O
alone O
in O
the O
world, O
I O
do O
believe." O
"Spirit!" O
said O
Scrooge O
in O
a O
broken O
voice, O
"remove O
me O
from O
this O
place." O
"I O
told O
you O
these O
were O
shadows O
of O
the O
things O
that O
have O
been," O
said O
the O
Ghost. O
"That O
they O
are O
what O
they O
are, O
do O
not O
blame O
me!" O
"Remove O
me!" O
Scrooge O
exclaimed. O
"I O
cannot O
bear O
it!" O
He O
turned O
upon O
the O
Ghost, O
and O
seeing O
that O
it O
looked O
upon O
him O
with O
a O
face, O
in O
which O
in O
some O
strange O
way O
there O
were O
fragments O
of O
all O
the O
faces O
it O
had O
shown O
him, O
wrestled O
with O
it. O
"Leave O
me! O
Take O
me O
back. O
Haunt O
me O
no O
longer!" O
In O
the O
struggle, O
if O
that O
can O
be O
called O
a O
struggle O
in O
which O
the O
Ghost O
with O
no O
visible O
resistance O
on O
its O
own O
part O
was O
undisturbed O
by O
any O
effort O
of O
its O
adversary, O
Scrooge O
observed O
that O
its O
light O
was O
burning O
high O
and O
bright; O
and O
dimly O
connecting O
that O
with O
its O
influence O
over O
him, O
he O
seized O
the O
extinguisher-cap, O
and O
by O
a O
sudden O
action O
pressed O
it O
down O
upon O
its O
head. O
The O
Spirit O
dropped O
beneath O
it, O
so O
that O
the O
extinguisher O
covered O
its O
whole O
form; O
but O
though O
Scrooge O
pressed O
it O
down O
with O
all O
his O
force, O
he O
could O
not O
hide O
the O
light: O
which O
streamed O
from O
under O
it, O
in O
an O
unbroken O
flood O
upon O
the O
ground. O
He O
was O
conscious O
of O
being O
exhausted, O
and O
overcome O
by O
an O
irresistible O
drowsiness; O
and, O
further, O
of O
being O
in O
his O
own O
bedroom. O
He O
gave O
the O
cap O
a O
parting O
squeeze, O
in O
which O
his O
hand O
relaxed; O
and O
had O
barely O
time O
to O
reel O
to O
bed, O
before O
he O
sank O
into O
a O
heavy O
sleep. O
AWAKING O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
a O
prodigiously O
tough O
snore, O
and O
sitting O
up O
in O
bed O
to O
get O
his O
thoughts O
together, O
Scrooge O
had O
no O
occasion O
to O
be O
told O
that O
the O
bell O
was O
again O
upon O
the O
stroke O
of O
One. O
He O
felt O
that O
he O
was O
restored O
to O
consciousness O
in O
the O
right O
nick O
of O
time, O
for O
the O
especial O
purpose O
of O
holding O
a O
conference O
with O
the O
second O
messenger O
despatched O
to O
him O
through O
Jacob O
Marley's O
intervention. O
But O
finding O
that O
he O
turned O
uncomfortably O
cold O
when O
he O
began O
to O
wonder O
which O
of O
his O
curtains O
this O
new O
spectre O
would O
draw O
back, O
he O
put O
them O
every O
one O
aside O
with O
his O
own O
hands; O
and O
lying O
down O
again, O
established O
a O
sharp O
look-out O
all O
round O
the O
bed. O
For O
he O
wished O
to O
challenge O
the O
Spirit O
on O
the O
moment O
of O
its O
appearance, O
and O
did O
not O
wish O
to O
be O
taken O
by O
surprise, O
and O
made O
nervous. O
 O
Gentlemen O
of O
the O
free-and-easy O
sort, O
who O
plume O
themselves O
on O
being O
acquainted O
with O
a O
move O
or O
two, O
and O
being O
usually O
equal O
to O
the O
time-of-day, O
express O
the O
wide O
range O
of O
their O
capacity O
for O
adventure O
by O
observing O
that O
they O
are O
good O
for O
anything O
from O
pitch-and-toss O
to O
manslaughter; O
between O
which O
opposite O
extremes, O
no O
doubt, O
there O
lies O
a O
tolerably O
wide O
and O
comprehensive O
range O
of O
subjects. O
Without O
venturing O
for O
Scrooge O
quite O
as O
hardily O
as O
this, O
I O
don't O
mind O
calling O
on O
you O
to O
believe O
that O
he O
was O
ready O
for O
a O
good O
broad O
field O
of O
strange O
appearances, O
and O
that O
nothing O
between O
a O
baby O
and O
rhinoceros O
would O
have O
astonished O
him O
very O
much. O
 O
Now, O
being O
prepared O
for O
almost O
anything, O
he O
was O
not O
by O
any O
means O
prepared O
for O
nothing; O
and, O
consequently, O
when O
the O
Bell O
struck O
One, O
and O
no O
shape O
appeared, O
he O
was O
taken O
with O
a O
violent O
fit O
of O
trembling. O
Five O
minutes, O
ten O
minutes, O
a O
quarter O
of O
an O
hour O
went O
by, O
yet O
nothing O
came. O
All O
this O
time, O
he O
lay O
upon O
his O
bed, O
the O
very O
core O
and O
centre O
of O
a O
blaze O
of O
ruddy O
light, O
which O
streamed O
upon O
it O
when O
the O
clock O
proclaimed O
the O
hour; O
and O
which, O
being O
only O
light, O
was O
more O
alarming O
than O
a O
dozen O
ghosts, O
as O
he O
was O
powerless O
to O
make O
out O
what O
it O
meant, O
or O
would O
be O
at; O
and O
was O
sometimes O
apprehensive O
that O
he O
might O
be O
at O
that O
very O
moment O
an O
interesting O
case O
of O
spontaneous O
combustion, O
without O
having O
the O
consolation O
of O
knowing O
it. O
At O
last, O
however, O
he O
began O
to O
think--as O
you O
or O
I O
would O
have O
thought O
at O
first; O
for O
it O
is O
always O
the O
person O
not O
in O
the O
predicament O
who O
knows O
what O
ought O
to O
have O
been O
done O
in O
it, O
and O
would O
unquestionably O
have O
done O
it O
too--at O
last, O
I O
say, O
he O
began O
to O
think O
that O
the O
source O
and O
secret O
of O
this O
ghostly O
light O
might O
be O
in O
the O
adjoining O
room, O
from O
whence, O
on O
further O
tracing O
it, O
it O
seemed O
to O
shine. O
This O
idea O
taking O
full O
possession O
of O
his O
mind, O
he O
got O
up O
softly O
and O
shuffled O
in O
his O
slippers O
to O
the O
door. O
 O
The O
moment O
Scrooge's O
hand O
was O
on O
the O
lock, O
a O
strange O
voice O
called O
him O
by O
his O
name, O
and O
bade O
him O
enter. O
He O
obeyed. O
 O
It O
was O
his O
own O
room. O
There O
was O
no O
doubt O
about O
that. O
But O
it O
had O
undergone O
a O
surprising O
transformation. O
The O
walls O
and O
ceiling O
were O
so O
hung O
with O
living O
green, O
that O
it O
looked O
a O
perfect O
grove; O
from O
every O
part O
of O
which, O
bright O
gleaming O
berries O
glistened. O
The O
crisp O
leaves O
of O
holly, O
mistletoe, O
and O
ivy O
reflected O
back O
the O
light, O
as O
if O
so O
many O
little O
mirrors O
had O
been O
scattered O
there; O
and O
such O
a O
mighty O
blaze O
went O
roaring O
up O
the O
chimney, O
as O
that O
dull O
petrification O
of O
a O
hearth O
had O
never O
known O
in O
Scrooge's O
time, O
or O
Marley's, O
or O
for O
many O
and O
many O
a O
winter O
season O
gone. O
Heaped O
up O
on O
the O
floor, O
to O
form O
a O
kind O
of O
throne, O
were O
turkeys, O
geese, O
game, O
poultry, O
brawn, O
great O
joints O
of O
meat, O
sucking-pigs, O
long O
wreaths O
of O
sausages, O
mince-pies, O
plum-puddings, O
barrels O
of O
oysters, O
red-hot O
chestnuts, O
cherry-cheeked O
apples, O
juicy O
oranges, O
luscious O
pears, O
immense O
twelfth-cakes, O
and O
seething O
bowls O
of O
punch, O
that O
made O
the O
chamber O
dim O
with O
their O
delicious O
steam. O
In O
easy O
state O
upon O
this O
couch, O
there O
sat O
a O
jolly O
Giant, O
glorious O
to O
see; O
who O
bore O
a O
glowing O
torch, O
in O
shape O
not O
unlike O
Plenty's O
horn, O
and O
held O
it O
up, O
high O
up, O
to O
shed O
its O
light O
on O
Scrooge, O
as O
he O
came O
peeping O
round O
the O
door. O
 O
"Come O
in!" O
exclaimed O
the O
Ghost. O
"Come O
in! O
and O
know O
me O
better, O
man!" O
 O
Scrooge O
entered O
timidly, O
and O
hung O
his O
head O
before O
this O
Spirit. O
He O
was O
not O
the O
dogged O
Scrooge O
he O
had O
been; O
and O
though O
the O
Spirit's O
eyes O
were O
clear O
and O
kind, O
he O
did O
not O
like O
to O
meet O
them. O
 O
"I O
am O
the O
Ghost O
of O
Christmas O
Present," O
said O
the O
Spirit. O
"Look O
upon O
me!" O
 O
Scrooge O
reverently O
did O
so. O
It O
was O
clothed O
in O
one O
simple O
green O
robe, O
or O
mantle, O
bordered O
with O
white O
fur. O
This O
garment O
hung O
so O
loosely O
on O
the O
figure, O
that O
its O
capacious O
breast O
was O
bare, O
as O
if O
disdaining O
to O
be O
warded O
or O
concealed O
by O
any O
artifice. O
Its O
feet, O
observable O
beneath O
the O
ample O
folds O
of O
the O
garment, O
were O
also O
bare; O
and O
on O
its O
head O
it O
wore O
no O
other O
covering O
than O
a O
holly O
wreath, O
set O
here O
and O
there O
with O
shining O
icicles. O
Its O
dark O
brown O
curls O
were O
long O
and O
free; O
free O
as O
its O
genial O
face, O
its O
sparkling O
eye, O
its O
open O
hand, O
its O
cheery O
voice, O
its O
unconstrained O
demeanour, O
and O
its O
joyful O
air. O
Girded O
round O
its O
middle O
was O
an O
antique O
scabbard; O
but O
no O
sword O
was O
in O
it, O
and O
the O
ancient O
sheath O
was O
eaten O
up O
with O
rust. O
 O
"You O
have O
never O
seen O
the O
like O
of O
me O
before!" O
exclaimed O
the O
Spirit. O
 O
"Never," O
Scrooge O
made O
answer O
to O
it. O
 O
"Have O
never O
walked O
forth O
with O
the O
younger O
members O
of O
my O
family; O
meaning O
(for O
I O
am O
very O
young) O
my O
elder O
brothers O
born O
in O
these O
later O
years?" O
pursued O
the O
Phantom. O
 O
"I O
don't O
think O
I O
have," O
said O
Scrooge. O
"I O
am O
afraid O
I O
have O
not. O
Have O
you O
had O
many O
brothers, O
Spirit?" O
 O
"More O
than O
eighteen O
hundred," O
said O
the O
Ghost. O
 O
"A O
tremendous O
family O
to O
provide O
for!" O
muttered O
Scrooge. O
 O
The O
Ghost O
of O
Christmas O
Present O
rose. O
 O
"Spirit," O
said O
Scrooge O
submissively, O
"conduct O
me O
where O
you O
will. O
I O
went O
forth O
last O
night O
on O
compulsion, O
and O
I O
learnt O
a O
lesson O
which O
is O
working O
now. O
To-night, O
if O
you O
have O
aught O
to O
teach O
me, O
let O
me O
profit O
by O
it." O
 O
"Touch O
my O
robe!" O
 O
Scrooge O
did O
as O
he O
was O
told, O
and O
held O
it O
fast. O
 O
Holly, O
mistletoe, O
red O
berries, O
ivy, O
turkeys, O
geese, O
game, O
poultry, O
brawn, O
meat, O
pigs, O
sausages, O
oysters, O
pies, O
puddings, O
fruit, O
and O
punch, O
all O
vanished O
instantly. O
So O
did O
the O
room, O
the O
fire, O
the O
ruddy O
glow, O
the O
hour O
of O
night, O
and O
they O
stood O
in O
the O
city O
streets O
on O
Christmas O
morning, O
where O
(for O
the O
weather O
was O
severe) O
the O
people O
made O
a O
rough, O
but O
brisk O
and O
not O
unpleasant O
kind O
of O
music, O
in O
scraping O
the O
snow O
from O
the O
pavement O
in O
front O
of O
their O
dwellings, O
and O
from O
the O
tops O
of O
their O
houses, O
whence O
it O
was O
mad O
delight O
to O
the O
boys O
to O
see O
it O
come O
plumping O
down O
into O
the O
road O
below, O
and O
splitting O
into O
artificial O
little O
snow-storms. O
 O
The O
house O
fronts O
looked O
black O
enough, O
and O
the O
windows O
blacker, O
contrasting O
with O
the O
smooth O
white O
sheet O
of O
snow O
upon O
the O
roofs, O
and O
with O
the O
dirtier O
snow O
upon O
the O
ground; O
which O
last O
deposit O
had O
been O
ploughed O
up O
in O
deep O
furrows O
by O
the O
heavy O
wheels O
of O
carts O
and O
waggons; O
furrows O
that O
crossed O
and O
re-crossed O
each O
other O
hundreds O
of O
times O
where O
the O
great O
streets O
branched O
off; O
and O
made O
intricate O
channels, O
hard O
to O
trace O
in O
the O
thick O
yellow O
mud O
and O
icy O
water. O
The O
sky O
was O
gloomy, O
and O
the O
shortest O
streets O
were O
choked O
up O
with O
a O
dingy O
mist, O
half O
thawed, O
half O
frozen, O
whose O
heavier O
particles O
descended O
in O
a O
shower O
of O
sooty O
atoms, O
as O
if O
all O
the O
chimneys O
in O
Great O
Britain O
had, O
by O
one O
consent, O
caught O
fire, O
and O
were O
blazing O
away O
to O
their O
dear O
hearts' O
content. O
There O
was O
nothing O
very O
cheerful O
in O
the O
climate O
or O
the O
town, O
and O
yet O
was O
there O
an O
air O
of O
cheerfulness O
abroad O
that O
the O
clearest O
summer O
air O
and O
brightest O
summer O
sun O
might O
have O
endeavoured O
to O
diffuse O
in O
vain. O
 O
For, O
the O
people O
who O
were O
shovelling O
away O
on O
the O
housetops O
were O
jovial O
and O
full O
of O
glee; O
calling O
out O
to O
one O
another O
from O
the O
parapets, O
and O
now O
and O
then O
exchanging O
a O
facetious O
snowball--better-natured O
missile O
far O
than O
many O
a O
wordy O
jest-- O
laughing O
heartily O
if O
it O
went O
right O
and O
not O
less O
heartily O
if O
it O
went O
wrong. O
The O
poulterers' O
shops O
were O
still O
half O
open, O
and O
the O
fruiterers' O
were O
radiant O
in O
their O
glory. O
There O
were O
great, O
round, O
pot-bellied O
baskets O
of O
chestnuts, O
shaped O
like O
the O
waistcoats O
of O
jolly O
old O
gentlemen, O
lolling O
at O
the O
doors, O
and O
tumbling O
out O
into O
the O
street O
in O
their O
apoplectic O
opulence. O
There O
were O
ruddy, O
brown-faced, O
broad-girthed O
Spanish O
Onions, O
shining O
in O
the O
fatness O
of O
their O
growth O
like O
Spanish O
Friars, O
and O
winking O
from O
their O
shelves O
in O
wanton O
slyness O
at O
the O
girls O
as O
they O
went O
by, O
and O
glanced O
demurely O
at O
the O
hung-up O
mistletoe. O
There O
were O
pears O
and O
apples, O
clustered O
high O
in O
blooming O
pyramids; O
there O
were O
bunches O
of O
grapes, O
made, O
in O
the O
shopkeepers' O
benevolence O
to O
dangle O
from O
conspicuous O
hooks, O
that O
people's O
mouths O
might O
water O
gratis O
as O
they O
passed; O
there O
were O
piles O
of O
filberts, O
mossy O
and O
brown, O
recalling, O
in O
their O
fragrance, O
ancient O
walks O
among O
the O
woods, O
and O
pleasant O
shufflings O
ankle O
deep O
through O
withered O
leaves; O
there O
were O
Norfolk O
Biffins, O
squat O
and O
swarthy, O
setting O
off O
the O
yellow O
of O
the O
oranges O
and O
lemons, O
and, O
in O
the O
great O
compactness O
of O
their O
juicy O
persons, O
urgently O
entreating O
and O
beseeching O
to O
be O
carried O
home O
in O
paper O
bags O
and O
eaten O
after O
dinner. O
The O
very O
gold O
and O
silver O
fish, O
set O
forth O
among O
these O
choice O
fruits O
in O
a O
bowl, O
though O
members O
of O
a O
dull O
and O
stagnant-blooded O
race, O
appeared O
to O
know O
that O
there O
was O
something O
going O
on; O
and, O
to O
a O
fish, O
went O
gasping O
round O
and O
round O
their O
little O
world O
in O
slow O
and O
passionless O
excitement. O
 O
The O
Grocers'! O
oh, O
the O
Grocers'! O
nearly O
closed, O
with O
perhaps O
two O
shutters O
down, O
or O
one; O
but O
through O
those O
gaps O
such O
glimpses! O
It O
was O
not O
alone O
that O
the O
scales O
descending O
on O
the O
counter O
made O
a O
merry O
sound, O
or O
that O
the O
twine O
and O
roller O
parted O
company O
so O
briskly, O
or O
that O
the O
canisters O
were O
rattled O
up O
and O
down O
like O
juggling O
tricks, O
or O
even O
that O
the O
blended O
scents O
of O
tea O
and O
coffee O
were O
so O
grateful O
to O
the O
nose, O
or O
even O
that O
the O
raisins O
were O
so O
plentiful O
and O
rare, O
the O
almonds O
so O
extremely O
white, O
the O
sticks O
of O
cinnamon O
so O
long O
and O
straight, O
the O
other O
spices O
so O
delicious, O
the O
candied O
fruits O
so O
caked O
and O
spotted O
with O
molten O
sugar O
as O
to O
make O
the O
coldest O
lookers-on O
feel O
faint O
and O
subsequently O
bilious. O
Nor O
was O
it O
that O
the O
figs O
were O
moist O
and O
pulpy, O
or O
that O
the O
French O
plums O
blushed O
in O
modest O
tartness O
from O
their O
highly-decorated O
boxes, O
or O
that O
everything O
was O
good O
to O
eat O
and O
in O
its O
Christmas O
dress; O
but O
the O
customers O
were O
all O
so O
hurried O
and O
so O
eager O
in O
the O
hopeful O
promise O
of O
the O
day, O
that O
they O
tumbled O
up O
against O
each O
other O
at O
the O
door, O
crashing O
their O
wicker O
baskets O
wildly, O
and O
left O
their O
purchases O
upon O
the O
counter, O
and O
came O
running O
back O
to O
fetch O
them, O
and O
committed O
hundreds O
of O
the O
like O
mistakes, O
in O
the O
best O
humour O
possible; O
while O
the O
Grocer O
and O
his O
people O
were O
so O
frank O
and O
fresh O
that O
the O
polished O
hearts O
with O
which O
they O
fastened O
their O
aprons O
behind O
might O
have O
been O
their O
own, O
worn O
outside O
for O
general O
inspection, O
and O
for O
Christmas O
daws O
to O
peck O
at O
if O
they O
chose. O
 O
But O
soon O
the O
steeples O
called O
good O
people O
all, O
to O
church O
and O
chapel, O
and O
away O
they O
came, O
flocking O
through O
the O
streets O
in O
their O
best O
clothes, O
and O
with O
their O
gayest O
faces. O
And O
at O
the O
same O
time O
there O
emerged O
from O
scores O
of O
bye-streets, O
lanes, O
and O
nameless O
turnings, O
innumerable O
people, O
carrying O
their O
dinners O
to O
the O
bakers' O
shops. O
The O
sight O
of O
these O
poor O
revellers O
appeared O
to O
interest O
the O
Spirit O
very O
much, O
for O
he O
stood O
with O
Scrooge O
beside O
him O
in O
a O
baker's O
doorway, O
and O
taking O
off O
the O
covers O
as O
their O
bearers O
passed, O
sprinkled O
incense O
on O
their O
dinners O
from O
his O
torch. O
And O
it O
was O
a O
very O
uncommon O
kind O
of O
torch, O
for O
once O
or O
twice O
when O
there O
were O
angry O
words O
between O
some O
dinner-carriers O
who O
had O
jostled O
each O
other, O
he O
shed O
a O
few O
drops O
of O
water O
on O
them O
from O
it, O
and O
their O
good O
humour O
was O
restored O
directly. O
For O
they O
said, O
it O
was O
a O
shame O
to O
quarrel O
upon O
Christmas O
Day. O
And O
so O
it O
was! O
God O
love O
it, O
so O
it O
was! O
 O
In O
time O
the O
bells O
ceased, O
and O
the O
bakers O
were O
shut O
up; O
and O
yet O
there O
was O
a O
genial O
shadowing O
forth O
of O
all O
these O
dinners O
and O
the O
progress O
of O
their O
cooking, O
in O
the O
thawed O
blotch O
of O
wet O
above O
each O
baker's O
oven; O
where O
the O
pavement O
smoked O
as O
if O
its O
stones O
were O
cooking O
too. O
 O
"Is O
there O
a O
peculiar O
flavour O
in O
what O
you O
sprinkle O
from O
your O
torch?" O
asked O
Scrooge. O
 O
"There O
is. O
My O
own." O
 O
"Would O
it O
apply O
to O
any O
kind O
of O
dinner O
on O
this O
day?" O
asked O
Scrooge. O
 O
"To O
any O
kindly O
given. O
To O
a O
poor O
one O
most." O
 O
"Why O
to O
a O
poor O
one O
most?" O
asked O
Scrooge. O
 O
"Because O
it O
needs O
it O
most." O
 O
"Spirit," O
said O
Scrooge, O
after O
a O
moment's O
thought, O
"I O
wonder O
you, O
of O
all O
the O
beings O
in O
the O
many O
worlds O
about O
us, O
should O
desire O
to O
cramp O
these O
people's O
opportunities O
of O
innocent O
enjoyment." O
 O
"I!" O
cried O
the O
Spirit. O
 O
"You O
would O
deprive O
them O
of O
their O
means O
of O
dining O
every O
seventh O
day, O
often O
the O
only O
day O
on O
which O
they O
can O
be O
said O
to O
dine O
at O
all," O
said O
Scrooge. O
"Wouldn't O
you?" O
 O
"I!" O
cried O
the O
Spirit. O
 O
"You O
seek O
to O
close O
these O
places O
on O
the O
Seventh O
Day?" O
said O
Scrooge. O
"And O
it O
comes O
to O
the O
same O
thing." O
 O
"I O
seek!" O
exclaimed O
the O
Spirit. O
 O
"Forgive O
me O
if O
I O
am O
wrong. O
It O
has O
been O
done O
in O
your O
name, O
or O
at O
least O
in O
that O
of O
your O
family," O
said O
Scrooge. O
 O
"There O
are O
some O
upon O
this O
earth O
of O
yours," O
returned O
the O
Spirit, O
"who O
lay O
claim O
to O
know O
us, O
and O
who O
do O
their O
deeds O
of O
passion, O
pride, O
ill-will, O
hatred, O
envy, O
bigotry, O
and O
selfishness O
in O
our O
name, O
who O
are O
as O
strange O
to O
us O
and O
all O
our O
kith O
and O
kin, O
as O
if O
they O
had O
never O
lived. O
Remember O
that, O
and O
charge O
their O
doings O
on O
themselves, O
not O
us." O
 O
Scrooge O
promised O
that O
he O
would; O
and O
they O
went O
on, O
invisible, O
as O
they O
had O
been O
before, O
into O
the O
suburbs O
of O
the O
town. O
It O
was O
a O
remarkable O
quality O
of O
the O
Ghost O
(which O
Scrooge O
had O
observed O
at O
the O
baker's), O
that O
notwithstanding O
his O
gigantic O
size, O
he O
could O
accommodate O
himself O
to O
any O
place O
with O
ease; O
and O
that O
he O
stood O
beneath O
a O
low O
roof O
quite O
as O
gracefully O
and O
like O
a O
supernatural O
creature, O
as O
it O
was O
possible O
he O
could O
have O
done O
in O
any O
lofty O
hall. O
 O
And O
perhaps O
it O
was O
the O
pleasure O
the O
good O
Spirit O
had O
in O
showing O
off O
this O
power O
of O
his, O
or O
else O
it O
was O
his O
own O
kind, O
generous, O
hearty O
nature, O
and O
his O
sympathy O
with O
all O
poor O
men, O
that O
led O
him O
straight O
to O
Scrooge's O
clerk's; O
for O
there O
he O
went, O
and O
took O
Scrooge O
with O
him, O
holding O
to O
his O
robe; O
and O
on O
the O
threshold O
of O
the O
door O
the O
Spirit O
smiled, O
and O
stopped O
to O
bless O
Bob O
Cratchit's O
dwelling O
with O
the O
sprinkling O
of O
his O
torch. O
Think O
of O
that! O
Bob O
had O
but O
fifteen O
"Bob" O
a-week O
himself; O
he O
pocketed O
on O
Saturdays O
but O
fifteen O
copies O
of O
his O
Christian O
name; O
and O
yet O
the O
Ghost O
of O
Christmas O
Present O
blessed O
his O
four-roomed O
house! O
 O
Then O
up O
rose O
Mrs. O
Cratchit, O
Cratchit's O
wife, O
dressed O
out O
but O
poorly O
in O
a O
twice-turned O
gown, O
but O
brave O
in O
ribbons, O
which O
are O
cheap O
and O
make O
a O
goodly O
show O
for O
sixpence; O
and O
she O
laid O
the O
cloth, O
assisted O
by O
Belinda O
Cratchit, O
second O
of O
her O
daughters, O
also O
brave O
in O
ribbons; O
while O
Master O
Peter O
Cratchit O
plunged O
a O
fork O
into O
the O
saucepan O
of O
potatoes, O
and O
getting O
the O
corners O
of O
his O
monstrous O
shirt O
collar O
(Bob's O
private O
property, O
conferred O
upon O
his O
son O
and O
heir O
in O
honour O
of O
the O
day) O
into O
his O
mouth, O
rejoiced O
to O
find O
himself O
so O
gallantly O
attired, O
and O
yearned O
to O
show O
his O
linen O
in O
the O
fashionable O
Parks. O
And O
now O
two O
smaller O
Cratchits, O
boy O
and O
girl, O
came O
tearing O
in, O
screaming O
that O
outside O
the O
baker's O
they O
had O
smelt O
the O
goose, O
and O
known O
it O
for O
their O
own; O
and O
basking O
in O
luxurious O
thoughts O
of O
sage O
and O
onion, O
these O
young O
Cratchits O
danced O
about O
the O
table, O
and O
exalted O
Master O
Peter O
Cratchit O
to O
the O
skies, O
while O
he O
(not O
proud, O
although O
his O
collars O
nearly O
choked O
him) O
blew O
the O
fire, O
until O
the O
slow O
potatoes O
bubbling O
up, O
knocked O
loudly O
at O
the O
saucepan-lid O
to O
be O
let O
out O
and O
peeled. O
 O
"What O
has O
ever O
got O
your O
precious O
father O
then?" O
said O
Mrs. O
Cratchit. O
"And O
your O
brother, O
Tiny O
Tim! O
And O
Martha O
warn't O
as O
late O
last O
Christmas O
Day O
by O
half-an-hour?" O
 O
"Here's O
Martha, O
mother!" O
said O
a O
girl, O
appearing O
as O
she O
spoke. O
 O
"Here's O
Martha, O
mother!" O
cried O
the O
two O
young O
Cratchits. O
"Hurrah! O
There's O
such O
a O
goose, O
Martha!" O
 O
"Why, O
bless O
your O
heart O
alive, O
my O
dear, O
how O
late O
you O
are!" O
said O
Mrs. O
Cratchit, O
kissing O
her O
a O
dozen O
times, O
and O
taking O
off O
her O
shawl O
and O
bonnet O
for O
her O
with O
officious O
zeal. O
 O
"We'd O
a O
deal O
of O
work O
to O
finish O
up O
last O
night," O
replied O
the O
girl, O
"and O
had O
to O
clear O
away O
this O
morning, O
mother!" O
 O
"Well! O
Never O
mind O
so O
long O
as O
you O
are O
come," O
said O
Mrs. O
Cratchit. O
"Sit O
ye O
down O
before O
the O
fire, O
my O
dear, O
and O
have O
a O
warm, O
Lord O
bless O
ye!" O
 O
"No, O
no! O
There's O
father O
coming," O
cried O
the O
two O
young O
Cratchits, O
who O
were O
everywhere O
at O
once. O
"Hide, O
Martha, O
hide!" O
 O
So O
Martha O
hid O
herself, O
and O
in O
came O
little O
Bob, O
the O
father, O
with O
at O
least O
three O
feet O
of O
comforter O
exclusive O
of O
the O
fringe, O
hanging O
down O
before O
him; O
and O
his O
threadbare O
clothes O
darned O
up O
and O
brushed, O
to O
look O
seasonable; O
and O
Tiny O
Tim O
upon O
his O
shoulder. O
Alas O
for O
Tiny O
Tim, O
he O
bore O
a O
little O
crutch, O
and O
had O
his O
limbs O
supported O
by O
an O
iron O
frame! O
 O
"Why, O
where's O
our O
Martha?" O
cried O
Bob O
Cratchit, O
looking O
round. O
 O
"Not O
coming," O
said O
Mrs. O
Cratchit. O
 O
"Not O
coming!" O
said O
Bob, O
with O
a O
sudden O
declension O
in O
his O
high O
spirits; O
for O
he O
had O
been O
Tim's O
blood O
horse O
all O
the O
way O
from O
church, O
and O
had O
come O
home O
rampant. O
"Not O
coming O
upon O
Christmas O
Day!" O
 O
Martha O
didn't O
like O
to O
see O
him O
disappointed, O
if O
it O
were O
only O
in O
joke; O
so O
she O
came O
out O
prematurely O
from O
behind O
the O
closet O
door, O
and O
ran O
into O
his O
arms, O
while O
the O
two O
young O
Cratchits O
hustled O
Tiny O
Tim, O
and O
bore O
him O
off O
into O
the O
wash-house, O
that O
he O
might O
hear O
the O
pudding O
singing O
in O
the O
copper. O
 O
"And O
how O
did O
little O
Tim O
behave?" O
asked O
Mrs. O
Cratchit, O
when O
she O
had O
rallied O
Bob O
on O
his O
credulity, O
and O
Bob O
had O
hugged O
his O
daughter O
to O
his O
heart's O
content. O
 O
"As O
good O
as O
gold," O
said O
Bob, O
"and O
better. O
Somehow O
he O
gets O
thoughtful, O
sitting O
by O
himself O
so O
much, O
and O
thinks O
the O
strangest O
things O
you O
ever O
heard. O
He O
told O
me, O
coming O
home, O
that O
he O
hoped O
the O
people O
saw O
him O
in O
the O
church, O
because O
he O
was O
a O
cripple, O
and O
it O
might O
be O
pleasant O
to O
them O
to O
remember O
upon O
Christmas O
Day, O
who O
made O
lame O
beggars O
walk, O
and O
blind O
men O
see." O
 O
Bob's O
voice O
was O
tremulous O
when O
he O
told O
them O
this, O
and O
trembled O
more O
when O
he O
said O
that O
Tiny O
Tim O
was O
growing O
strong O
and O
hearty. O
 O
His O
active O
little O
crutch O
was O
heard O
upon O
the O
floor, O
and O
back O
came O
Tiny O
Tim O
before O
another O
word O
was O
spoken, O
escorted O
by O
his O
brother O
and O
sister O
to O
his O
stool O
before O
the O
fire; O
and O
while O
Bob, O
turning O
up O
his O
cuffs--as O
if, O
poor O
fellow, O
they O
were O
capable O
of O
being O
made O
more O
shabby--compounded O
some O
hot O
mixture O
in O
a O
jug O
with O
gin O
and O
lemons, O
and O
stirred O
it O
round O
and O
round O
and O
put O
it O
on O
the O
hob O
to O
simmer; O
Master O
Peter, O
and O
the O
two O
ubiquitous O
young O
Cratchits O
went O
to O
fetch O
the O
goose, O
with O
which O
they O
soon O
returned O
in O
high O
procession. O
 O
Such O
a O
bustle O
ensued O
that O
you O
might O
have O
thought O
a O
goose O
the O
rarest O
of O
all O
birds; O
a O
feathered O
phenomenon, O
to O
which O
a O
black O
swan O
was O
a O
matter O
of O
course--and O
in O
truth O
it O
was O
something O
very O
like O
it O
in O
that O
house. O
Mrs. O
Cratchit O
made O
the O
gravy O
(ready O
beforehand O
in O
a O
little O
saucepan) O
hissing O
hot; O
Master O
Peter O
mashed O
the O
potatoes O
with O
incredible O
vigour; O
Miss O
Belinda O
sweetened O
up O
the O
apple-sauce; O
Martha O
dusted O
the O
hot O
plates; O
Bob O
took O
Tiny O
Tim O
beside O
him O
in O
a O
tiny O
corner O
at O
the O
table; O
the O
two O
young O
Cratchits O
set O
chairs O
for O
everybody, O
not O
forgetting O
themselves, O
and O
mounting O
guard O
upon O
their O
posts, O
crammed O
spoons O
into O
their O
mouths, O
lest O
they O
should O
shriek O
for O
goose O
before O
their O
turn O
came O
to O
be O
helped. O
At O
last O
the O
dishes O
were O
set O
on, O
and O
grace O
was O
said. O
It O
was O
succeeded O
by O
a O
breathless O
pause, O
as O
Mrs. O
Cratchit, O
looking O
slowly O
all O
along O
the O
carving-knife, O
prepared O
to O
plunge O
it O
in O
the O
breast; O
but O
when O
she O
did, O
and O
when O
the O
long O
expected O
gush O
of O
stuffing O
issued O
forth, O
one O
murmur O
of O
delight O
arose O
all O
round O
the O
board, O
and O
even O
Tiny O
Tim, O
excited O
by O
the O
two O
young O
Cratchits, O
beat O
on O
the O
table O
with O
the O
handle O
of O
his O
knife, O
and O
feebly O
cried O
Hurrah! O
 O
There O
never O
was O
such O
a O
goose. O
Bob O
said O
he O
didn't O
believe O
there O
ever O
was O
such O
a O
goose O
cooked. O
Its O
tenderness O
and O
flavour, O
size O
and O
cheapness, O
were O
the O
themes O
of O
universal O
admiration. O
Eked O
out O
by O
apple-sauce O
and O
mashed O
potatoes, O
it O
was O
a O
sufficient O
dinner O
for O
the O
whole O
family; O
indeed, O
as O
Mrs. O
Cratchit O
said O
with O
great O
delight O
(surveying O
one O
small O
atom O
of O
a O
bone O
upon O
the O
dish), O
they O
hadn't O
ate O
it O
all O
at O
last! O
Yet O
every O
one O
had O
had O
enough, O
and O
the O
youngest O
Cratchits O
in O
particular, O
were O
steeped O
in O
sage O
and O
onion O
to O
the O
eyebrows! O
But O
now, O
the O
plates O
being O
changed O
by O
Miss O
Belinda, O
Mrs. O
Cratchit O
left O
the O
room O
alone--too O
nervous O
to O
bear O
witnesses--to O
take O
the O
pudding O
up O
and O
bring O
it O
in. O
 O
Suppose O
it O
should O
not O
be O
done O
enough! O
Suppose O
it O
should O
break O
in O
turning O
out! O
Suppose O
somebody O
should O
have O
got O
over O
the O
wall O
of O
the O
back-yard, O
and O
stolen O
it, O
while O
they O
were O
merry O
with O
the O
goose--a O
supposition O
at O
which O
the O
two O
young O
Cratchits O
became O
livid! O
All O
sorts O
of O
horrors O
were O
supposed. O
 O
Hallo! O
A O
great O
deal O
of O
steam! O
The O
pudding O
was O
out O
of O
the O
copper. O
A O
smell O
like O
a O
washing-day! O
That O
was O
the O
cloth. O
A O
smell O
like O
an O
eating-house O
and O
a O
pastrycook's O
next O
door O
to O
each O
other, O
with O
a O
laundress's O
next O
door O
to O
that! O
That O
was O
the O
pudding! O
In O
half O
a O
minute O
Mrs. O
Cratchit O
entered--flushed, O
but O
smiling O
proudly--with O
the O
pudding, O
like O
a O
speckled O
cannon-ball, O
so O
hard O
and O
firm, O
blazing O
in O
half O
of O
half-a-quartern O
of O
ignited O
brandy, O
and O
bedight O
with O
Christmas O
holly O
stuck O
into O
the O
top. O
 O
Oh, O
a O
wonderful O
pudding! O
Bob O
Cratchit O
said, O
and O
calmly O
too, O
that O
he O
regarded O
it O
as O
the O
greatest O
success O
achieved O
by O
Mrs. O
Cratchit O
since O
their O
marriage. O
Mrs. O
Cratchit O
said O
that O
now O
the O
weight O
was O
off O
her O
mind, O
she O
would O
confess O
she O
had O
had O
her O
doubts O
about O
the O
quantity O
of O
flour. O
Everybody O
had O
something O
to O
say O
about O
it, O
but O
nobody O
said O
or O
thought O
it O
was O
at O
all O
a O
small O
pudding O
for O
a O
large O
family. O
It O
would O
have O
been O
flat O
heresy O
to O
do O
so. O
Any O
Cratchit O
would O
have O
blushed O
to O
hint O
at O
such O
a O
thing. O
 O
At O
last O
the O
dinner O
was O
all O
done, O
the O
cloth O
was O
cleared, O
the O
hearth O
swept, O
and O
the O
fire O
made O
up. O
The O
compound O
in O
the O
jug O
being O
tasted, O
and O
considered O
perfect, O
apples O
and O
oranges O
were O
put O
upon O
the O
table, O
and O
a O
shovel-full O
of O
chestnuts O
on O
the O
fire. O
Then O
all O
the O
Cratchit O
family O
drew O
round O
the O
hearth, O
in O
what O
Bob O
Cratchit O
called O
a O
circle, O
meaning O
half O
a O
one; O
and O
at O
Bob O
Cratchit's O
elbow O
stood O
the O
family O
display O
of O
glass. O
Two O
tumblers, O
and O
a O
custard-cup O
without O
a O
handle. O
 O
These O
held O
the O
hot O
stuff O
from O
the O
jug, O
however, O
as O
well O
as O
golden O
goblets O
would O
have O
done; O
and O
Bob O
served O
it O
out O
with O
beaming O
looks, O
while O
the O
chestnuts O
on O
the O
fire O
sputtered O
and O
cracked O
noisily. O
Then O
Bob O
proposed: O
 O
"A O
Merry O
Christmas O
to O
us O
all, O
my O
dears. O
God O
bless O
us!" O
 O
Which O
all O
the O
family O
re-echoed. O
 O
"God O
bless O
us O
every O
one!" O
said O
Tiny O
Tim, O
the O
last O
of O
all. O
 O
He O
sat O
very O
close O
to O
his O
father's O
side O
upon O
his O
little O
stool. O
Bob O
held O
his O
withered O
little O
hand O
in O
his, O
as O
if O
he O
loved O
the O
child, O
and O
wished O
to O
keep O
him O
by O
his O
side, O
and O
dreaded O
that O
he O
might O
be O
taken O
from O
him. O
 O
"Spirit," O
said O
Scrooge, O
with O
an O
interest O
he O
had O
never O
felt O
before, O
"tell O
me O
if O
Tiny O
Tim O
will O
live." O
 O
"I O
see O
a O
vacant O
seat," O
replied O
the O
Ghost, O
"in O
the O
poor O
chimney-corner, O
and O
a O
crutch O
without O
an O
owner, O
carefully O
preserved. O
If O
these O
shadows O
remain O
unaltered O
by O
the O
Future, O
the O
child O
will O
die." O
 O
"No, O
no," O
said O
Scrooge. O
"Oh, O
no, O
kind O
Spirit! O
say O
he O
will O
be O
spared." O
 O
"If O
these O
shadows O
remain O
unaltered O
by O
the O
Future, O
none O
other O
of O
my O
race," O
returned O
the O
Ghost, O
"will O
find O
him O
here. O
What O
then? O
If O
he O
be O
like O
to O
die, O
he O
had O
better O
do O
it, O
and O
decrease O
the O
surplus O
population." O
 O
Scrooge O
hung O
his O
head O
to O
hear O
his O
own O
words O
quoted O
by O
the O
Spirit, O
and O
was O
overcome O
with O
penitence O
and O
grief. O
 O
"Man," O
said O
the O
Ghost, O
"if O
man O
you O
be O
in O
heart, O
not O
adamant, O
forbear O
that O
wicked O
cant O
until O
you O
have O
discovered O
What O
the O
surplus O
is, O
and O
Where O
it O
is. O
Will O
you O
decide O
what O
men O
shall O
live, O
what O
men O
shall O
die? O
It O
may O
be, O
that O
in O
the O
sight O
of O
Heaven, O
you O
are O
more O
worthless O
and O
less O
fit O
to O
live O
than O
millions O
like O
this O
poor O
man's O
child. O
Oh O
God! O
to O
hear O
the O
Insect O
on O
the O
leaf O
pronouncing O
on O
the O
too O
much O
life O
among O
his O
hungry O
brothers O
in O
the O
dust!" O
 O
Scrooge O
bent O
before O
the O
Ghost's O
rebuke, O
and O
trembling O
cast O
his O
eyes O
upon O
the O
ground. O
But O
he O
raised O
them O
speedily, O
on O
hearing O
his O
own O
name. O
 O
"Mr. O
Scrooge!" O
said O
Bob; O
"I'll O
give O
you O
Mr. O
Scrooge, O
the O
Founder O
of O
the O
Feast!" O
 O
"The O
Founder O
of O
the O
Feast O
indeed!" O
cried O
Mrs. O
Cratchit, O
reddening. O
"I O
wish O
I O
had O
him O
here. O
I'd O
give O
him O
a O
piece O
of O
my O
mind O
to O
feast O
upon, O
and O
I O
hope O
he'd O
have O
a O
good O
appetite O
for O
it." O
 O
"My O
dear," O
said O
Bob, O
"the O
children! O
Christmas O
Day." O
 O
"It O
should O
be O
Christmas O
Day, O
I O
am O
sure," O
said O
she, O
"on O
which O
one O
drinks O
the O
health O
of O
such O
an O
odious, O
stingy, O
hard, O
unfeeling O
man O
as O
Mr. O
Scrooge. O
You O
know O
he O
is, O
Robert! O
Nobody O
knows O
it O
better O
than O
you O
do, O
poor O
fellow!" O
 O
"My O
dear," O
was O
Bob's O
mild O
answer, O
"Christmas O
Day." O
 O
"I'll O
drink O
his O
health O
for O
your O
sake O
and O
the O
Day's," O
said O
Mrs. O
Cratchit, O
"not O
for O
his. O
Long O
life O
to O
him! O
A O
merry O
Christmas O
and O
a O
happy O
new O
year! O
He'll O
be O
very O
merry O
and O
very O
happy, O
I O
have O
no O
doubt!" O
 O
The O
children O
drank O
the O
toast O
after O
her. O
It O
was O
the O
first O
of O
their O
proceedings O
which O
had O
no O
heartiness. O
Tiny O
Tim O
drank O
it O
last O
of O
all, O
but O
he O
didn't O
care O
twopence O
for O
it. O
Scrooge O
was O
the O
Ogre O
of O
the O
family. O
The O
mention O
of O
his O
name O
cast O
a O
dark O
shadow O
on O
the O
party, O
which O
was O
not O
dispelled O
for O
full O
five O
minutes. O
 O
After O
it O
had O
passed O
away, O
they O
were O
ten O
times O
merrier O
than O
before, O
from O
the O
mere O
relief O
of O
Scrooge O
the O
Baleful O
being O
done O
with. O
Bob O
Cratchit O
told O
them O
how O
he O
had O
a O
situation O
in O
his O
eye O
for O
Master O
Peter, O
which O
would O
bring O
in, O
if O
obtained, O
full O
five-and-sixpence O
weekly. O
The O
two O
young O
Cratchits O
laughed O
tremendously O
at O
the O
idea O
of O
Peter's O
being O
a O
man O
of O
business; O
and O
Peter O
himself O
looked O
thoughtfully O
at O
the O
fire O
from O
between O
his O
collars, O
as O
if O
he O
were O
deliberating O
what O
particular O
investments O
he O
should O
favour O
when O
he O
came O
into O
the O
receipt O
of O
that O
bewildering O
income. O
Martha, O
who O
was O
a O
poor O
apprentice O
at O
a O
milliner's, O
then O
told O
them O
what O
kind O
of O
work O
she O
had O
to O
do, O
and O
how O
many O
hours O
she O
worked O
at O
a O
stretch, O
and O
how O
she O
meant O
to O
lie O
abed O
to-morrow O
morning O
for O
a O
good O
long O
rest; O
to-morrow O
being O
a O
holiday O
she O
passed O
at O
home. O
Also O
how O
she O
had O
seen O
a O
countess O
and O
a O
lord O
some O
days O
before, O
and O
how O
the O
lord O
"was O
much O
about O
as O
tall O
as O
Peter;" O
at O
which O
Peter O
pulled O
up O
his O
collars O
so O
high O
that O
you O
couldn't O
have O
seen O
his O
head O
if O
you O
had O
been O
there. O
All O
this O
time O
the O
chestnuts O
and O
the O
jug O
went O
round O
and O
round; O
and O
by-and-bye O
they O
had O
a O
song, O
about O
a O
lost O
child O
travelling O
in O
the O
snow, O
from O
Tiny O
Tim, O
who O
had O
a O
plaintive O
little O
voice, O
and O
sang O
it O
very O
well O
indeed. O
 O
There O
was O
nothing O
of O
high O
mark O
in O
this. O
They O
were O
not O
a O
handsome O
family; O
they O
were O
not O
well O
dressed; O
their O
shoes O
were O
far O
from O
being O
water-proof; O
their O
clothes O
were O
scanty; O
and O
Peter O
might O
have O
known, O
and O
very O
likely O
did, O
the O
inside O
of O
a O
pawnbroker's. O
But, O
they O
were O
happy, O
grateful, O
pleased O
with O
one O
another, O
and O
contented O
with O
the O
time; O
and O
when O
they O
faded, O
and O
looked O
happier O
yet O
in O
the O
bright O
sprinklings O
of O
the O
Spirit's O
torch O
at O
parting, O
Scrooge O
had O
his O
eye O
upon O
them, O
and O
especially O
on O
Tiny O
Tim, O
until O
the O
last. O
 O
By O
this O
time O
it O
was O
getting O
dark, O
and O
snowing O
pretty O
heavily; O
and O
as O
Scrooge O
and O
the O
Spirit O
went O
along O
the O
streets, O
the O
brightness O
of O
the O
roaring O
fires O
in O
kitchens, O
parlours, O
and O
all O
sorts O
of O
rooms, O
was O
wonderful. O
Here, O
the O
flickering O
of O
the O
blaze O
showed O
preparations O
for O
a O
cosy O
dinner, O
with O
hot O
plates O
baking O
through O
and O
through O
before O
the O
fire, O
and O
deep O
red O
curtains, O
ready O
to O
be O
drawn O
to O
shut O
out O
cold O
and O
darkness. O
There O
all O
the O
children O
of O
the O
house O
were O
running O
out O
into O
the O
snow O
to O
meet O
their O
married O
sisters, O
brothers, O
cousins, O
uncles, O
aunts, O
and O
be O
the O
first O
to O
greet O
them. O
Here, O
again, O
were O
shadows O
on O
the O
window-blind O
of O
guests O
assembling; O
and O
there O
a O
group O
of O
handsome O
girls, O
all O
hooded O
and O
fur-booted, O
and O
all O
chattering O
at O
once, O
tripped O
lightly O
off O
to O
some O
near O
neighbour's O
house; O
where, O
woe O
upon O
the O
single O
man O
who O
saw O
them O
enter--artful O
witches, O
well O
they O
knew O
it--in O
a O
glow! O
 O
But, O
if O
you O
had O
judged O
from O
the O
numbers O
of O
people O
on O
their O
way O
to O
friendly O
gatherings, O
you O
might O
have O
thought O
that O
no O
one O
was O
at O
home O
to O
give O
them O
welcome O
when O
they O
got O
there, O
instead O
of O
every O
house O
expecting O
company, O
and O
piling O
up O
its O
fires O
half-chimney O
high. O
Blessings O
on O
it, O
how O
the O
Ghost O
exulted! O
How O
it O
bared O
its O
breadth O
of O
breast, O
and O
opened O
its O
capacious O
palm, O
and O
floated O
on, O
outpouring, O
with O
a O
generous O
hand, O
its O
bright O
and O
harmless O
mirth O
on O
everything O
within O
its O
reach! O
The O
very O
lamplighter, O
who O
ran O
on O
before, O
dotting O
the O
dusky O
street O
with O
specks O
of O
light, O
and O
who O
was O
dressed O
to O
spend O
the O
evening O
somewhere, O
laughed O
out O
loudly O
as O
the O
Spirit O
passed, O
though O
little O
kenned O
the O
lamplighter O
that O
he O
had O
any O
company O
but O
Christmas! O
 O
And O
now, O
without O
a O
word O
of O
warning O
from O
the O
Ghost, O
they O
stood O
upon O
a O
bleak O
and O
desert O
moor, O
where O
monstrous O
masses O
of O
rude O
stone O
were O
cast O
about, O
as O
though O
it O
were O
the O
burial-place O
of O
giants; O
and O
water O
spread O
itself O
wheresoever O
it O
listed, O
or O
would O
have O
done O
so, O
but O
for O
the O
frost O
that O
held O
it O
prisoner; O
and O
nothing O
grew O
but O
moss O
and O
furze, O
and O
coarse O
rank O
grass. O
Down O
in O
the O
west O
the O
setting O
sun O
had O
left O
a O
streak O
of O
fiery O
red, O
which O
glared O
upon O
the O
desolation O
for O
an O
instant, O
like O
a O
sullen O
eye, O
and O
frowning O
lower, O
lower, O
lower O
yet, O
was O
lost O
in O
the O
thick O
gloom O
of O
darkest O
night. O
 O
"What O
place O
is O
this?" O
asked O
Scrooge. O
 O
"A O
place O
where O
Miners O
live, O
who O
labour O
in O
the O
bowels O
of O
the O
earth," O
returned O
the O
Spirit. O
"But O
they O
know O
me. O
See!" O
 O
A O
light O
shone O
from O
the O
window O
of O
a O
hut, O
and O
swiftly O
they O
advanced O
towards O
it. O
Passing O
through O
the O
wall O
of O
mud O
and O
stone, O
they O
found O
a O
cheerful O
company O
assembled O
round O
a O
glowing O
fire. O
An O
old, O
old O
man O
and O
woman, O
with O
their O
children O
and O
their O
children's O
children, O
and O
another O
generation O
beyond O
that, O
all O
decked O
out O
gaily O
in O
their O
holiday O
attire. O
The O
old O
man, O
in O
a O
voice O
that O
seldom O
rose O
above O
the O
howling O
of O
the O
wind O
upon O
the O
barren O
waste, O
was O
singing O
them O
a O
Christmas O
song--it O
had O
been O
a O
very O
old O
song O
when O
he O
was O
a O
boy--and O
from O
time O
to O
time O
they O
all O
joined O
in O
the O
chorus. O
So O
surely O
as O
they O
raised O
their O
voices, O
the O
old O
man O
got O
quite O
blithe O
and O
loud; O
and O
so O
surely O
as O
they O
stopped, O
his O
vigour O
sank O
again. O
 O
The O
Spirit O
did O
not O
tarry O
here, O
but O
bade O
Scrooge O
hold O
his O
robe, O
and O
passing O
on O
above O
the O
moor, O
sped--whither? O
Not O
to O
sea? O
To O
sea. O
To O
Scrooge's O
horror, O
looking O
back, O
he O
saw O
the O
last O
of O
the O
land, O
a O
frightful O
range O
of O
rocks, O
behind O
them; O
and O
his O
ears O
were O
deafened O
by O
the O
thundering O
of O
water, O
as O
it O
rolled O
and O
roared, O
and O
raged O
among O
the O
dreadful O
caverns O
it O
had O
worn, O
and O
fiercely O
tried O
to O
undermine O
the O
earth. O
 O
Built O
upon O
a O
dismal O
reef O
of O
sunken O
rocks, O
some O
league O
or O
so O
from O
shore, O
on O
which O
the O
waters O
chafed O
and O
dashed, O
the O
wild O
year O
through, O
there O
stood O
a O
solitary O
lighthouse. O
Great O
heaps O
of O
sea-weed O
clung O
to O
its O
base, O
and O
storm-birds O
--born O
of O
the O
wind O
one O
might O
suppose, O
as O
sea-weed O
of O
the O
water--rose O
and O
fell O
about O
it, O
like O
the O
waves O
they O
skimmed. O
 O
But O
even O
here, O
two O
men O
who O
watched O
the O
light O
had O
made O
a O
fire, O
that O
through O
the O
loophole O
in O
the O
thick O
stone O
wall O
shed O
out O
a O
ray O
of O
brightness O
on O
the O
awful O
sea. O
Joining O
their O
horny O
hands O
over O
the O
rough O
table O
at O
which O
they O
sat, O
they O
wished O
each O
other O
Merry O
Christmas O
in O
their O
can O
of O
grog; O
and O
one O
of O
them: O
the O
elder, O
too, O
with O
his O
face O
all O
damaged O
and O
scarred O
with O
hard O
weather, O
as O
the O
figure-head O
of O
an O
old O
ship O
might O
be: O
struck O
up O
a O
sturdy O
song O
that O
was O
like O
a O
Gale O
in O
itself. O
 O
Again O
the O
Ghost O
sped O
on, O
above O
the O
black O
and O
heaving O
sea O
--on, O
on--until, O
being O
far O
away, O
as O
he O
told O
Scrooge, O
from O
any O
shore, O
they O
lighted O
on O
a O
ship. O
They O
stood O
beside O
the O
helmsman O
at O
the O
wheel, O
the O
look-out O
in O
the O
bow, O
the O
officers O
who O
had O
the O
watch; O
dark, O
ghostly O
figures O
in O
their O
several O
stations; O
but O
every O
man O
among O
them O
hummed O
a O
Christmas O
tune, O
or O
had O
a O
Christmas O
thought, O
or O
spoke O
below O
his O
breath O
to O
his O
companion O
of O
some O
bygone O
Christmas O
Day, O
with O
homeward O
hopes O
belonging O
to O
it. O
And O
every O
man O
on O
board, O
waking O
or O
sleeping, O
good O
or O
bad, O
had O
had O
a O
kinder O
word O
for O
another O
on O
that O
day O
than O
on O
any O
day O
in O
the O
year; O
and O
had O
shared O
to O
some O
extent O
in O
its O
festivities; O
and O
had O
remembered O
those O
he O
cared O
for O
at O
a O
distance, O
and O
had O
known O
that O
they O
delighted O
to O
remember O
him. O
 O
It O
was O
a O
great O
surprise O
to O
Scrooge, O
while O
listening O
to O
the O
moaning O
of O
the O
wind, O
and O
thinking O
what O
a O
solemn O
thing O
it O
was O
to O
move O
on O
through O
the O
lonely O
darkness O
over O
an O
unknown O
abyss, O
whose O
depths O
were O
secrets O
as O
profound O
as O
Death: O
it O
was O
a O
great O
surprise O
to O
Scrooge, O
while O
thus O
engaged, O
to O
hear O
a O
hearty O
laugh. O
It O
was O
a O
much O
greater O
surprise O
to O
Scrooge O
to O
recognise O
it O
as O
his O
own O
nephew's O
and O
to O
find O
himself O
in O
a O
bright, O
dry, O
gleaming O
room, O
with O
the O
Spirit O
standing O
smiling O
by O
his O
side, O
and O
looking O
at O
that O
same O
nephew O
with O
approving O
affability! O
 O
"Ha, O
ha!" O
laughed O
Scrooge's O
nephew. O
"Ha, O
ha, O
ha!" O
 O
If O
you O
should O
happen, O
by O
any O
unlikely O
chance, O
to O
know O
a O
man O
more O
blest O
in O
a O
laugh O
than O
Scrooge's O
nephew, O
all O
I O
can O
say O
is, O
I O
should O
like O
to O
know O
him O
too. O
Introduce O
him O
to O
me, O
and O
I'll O
cultivate O
his O
acquaintance. O
 O
It O
is O
a O
fair, O
even-handed, O
noble O
adjustment O
of O
things, O
that O
while O
there O
is O
infection O
in O
disease O
and O
sorrow, O
there O
is O
nothing O
in O
the O
world O
so O
irresistibly O
contagious O
as O
laughter O
and O
good-humour. O
When O
Scrooge's O
nephew O
laughed O
in O
this O
way: O
holding O
his O
sides, O
rolling O
his O
head, O
and O
twisting O
his O
face O
into O
the O
most O
extravagant O
contortions: O
Scrooge's O
niece, O
by O
marriage, O
laughed O
as O
heartily O
as O
he. O
And O
their O
assembled O
friends O
being O
not O
a O
bit O
behindhand, O
roared O
out O
lustily. O
 O
"Ha, O
ha! O
Ha, O
ha, O
ha, O
ha!" O
 O
"He O
said O
that O
Christmas O
was O
a O
humbug, O
as O
I O
live!" O
cried O
Scrooge's O
nephew. O
"He O
believed O
it O
too!" O
 O
"More O
shame O
for O
him, O
Fred!" O
said O
Scrooge's O
niece, O
indignantly. O
Bless O
those O
women; O
they O
never O
do O
anything O
by O
halves. O
They O
are O
always O
in O
earnest. O
 O
She O
was O
very O
pretty: O
exceedingly O
pretty. O
With O
a O
dimpled, O
surprised-looking, O
capital O
face; O
a O
ripe O
little O
mouth, O
that O
seemed O
made O
to O
be O
kissed--as O
no O
doubt O
it O
was; O
all O
kinds O
of O
good O
little O
dots O
about O
her O
chin, O
that O
melted O
into O
one O
another O
when O
she O
laughed; O
and O
the O
sunniest O
pair O
of O
eyes O
you O
ever O
saw O
in O
any O
little O
creature's O
head. O
Altogether O
she O
was O
what O
you O
would O
have O
called O
provoking, O
you O
know; O
but O
satisfactory, O
too. O
Oh, O
perfectly O
satisfactory. O
 O
"He's O
a O
comical O
old O
fellow," O
said O
Scrooge's O
nephew, O
"that's O
the O
truth: O
and O
not O
so O
pleasant O
as O
he O
might O
be. O
However, O
his O
offences O
carry O
their O
own O
punishment, O
and O
I O
have O
nothing O
to O
say O
against O
him." O
 O
"I'm O
sure O
he O
is O
very O
rich, O
Fred," O
hinted O
Scrooge's O
niece. O
"At O
least O
you O
always O
tell O
me O
so." O
 O
"What O
of O
that, O
my O
dear!" O
said O
Scrooge's O
nephew. O
"His O
wealth O
is O
of O
no O
use O
to O
him. O
He O
don't O
do O
any O
good O
with O
it. O
He O
don't O
make O
himself O
comfortable O
with O
it. O
He O
hasn't O
the O
satisfaction O
of O
thinking--ha, O
ha, O
ha!--that O
he O
is O
ever O
going O
to O
benefit O
US O
with O
it." O
 O
"I O
have O
no O
patience O
with O
him," O
observed O
Scrooge's O
niece. O
Scrooge's O
niece's O
sisters, O
and O
all O
the O
other O
ladies, O
expressed O
the O
same O
opinion. O
 O
"Oh, O
I O
have!" O
said O
Scrooge's O
nephew. O
"I O
am O
sorry O
for O
him; O
I O
couldn't O
be O
angry O
with O
him O
if O
I O
tried. O
Who O
suffers O
by O
his O
ill O
whims! O
Himself, O
always. O
Here, O
he O
takes O
it O
into O
his O
head O
to O
dislike O
us, O
and O
he O
won't O
come O
and O
dine O
with O
us. O
What's O
the O
consequence? O
He O
don't O
lose O
much O
of O
a O
dinner." O
 O
"Indeed, O
I O
think O
he O
loses O
a O
very O
good O
dinner," O
interrupted O
Scrooge's O
niece. O
Everybody O
else O
said O
the O
same, O
and O
they O
must O
be O
allowed O
to O
have O
been O
competent O
judges, O
because O
they O
had O
just O
had O
dinner; O
and, O
with O
the O
dessert O
upon O
the O
table, O
were O
clustered O
round O
the O
fire, O
by O
lamplight. O
 O
"Well! O
I'm O
very O
glad O
to O
hear O
it," O
said O
Scrooge's O
nephew, O
"because O
I O
haven't O
great O
faith O
in O
these O
young O
housekeepers. O
What O
do O
you O
say, O
Topper?" O
 O
Topper O
had O
clearly O
got O
his O
eye O
upon O
one O
of O
Scrooge's O
niece's O
sisters, O
for O
he O
answered O
that O
a O
bachelor O
was O
a O
wretched O
outcast, O
who O
had O
no O
right O
to O
express O
an O
opinion O
on O
the O
subject. O
Whereat O
Scrooge's O
niece's O
sister--the O
plump O
one O
with O
the O
lace O
tucker: O
not O
the O
one O
with O
the O
roses--blushed. O
 O
"Do O
go O
on, O
Fred," O
said O
Scrooge's O
niece, O
clapping O
her O
hands. O
"He O
never O
finishes O
what O
he O
begins O
to O
say! O
He O
is O
such O
a O
ridiculous O
fellow!" O
 O
Scrooge's O
nephew O
revelled O
in O
another O
laugh, O
and O
as O
it O
was O
impossible O
to O
keep O
the O
infection O
off; O
though O
the O
plump O
sister O
tried O
hard O
to O
do O
it O
with O
aromatic O
vinegar; O
his O
example O
was O
unanimously O
followed. O
 O
"I O
was O
only O
going O
to O
say," O
said O
Scrooge's O
nephew, O
"that O
the O
consequence O
of O
his O
taking O
a O
dislike O
to O
us, O
and O
not O
making O
merry O
with O
us, O
is, O
as O
I O
think, O
that O
he O
loses O
some O
pleasant O
moments, O
which O
could O
do O
him O
no O
harm. O
I O
am O
sure O
he O
loses O
pleasanter O
companions O
than O
he O
can O
find O
in O
his O
own O
thoughts, O
either O
in O
his O
mouldy O
old O
office, O
or O
his O
dusty O
chambers. O
I O
mean O
to O
give O
him O
the O
same O
chance O
every O
year, O
whether O
he O
likes O
it O
or O
not, O
for O
I O
pity O
him. O
He O
may O
rail O
at O
Christmas O
till O
he O
dies, O
but O
he O
can't O
help O
thinking O
better O
of O
it--I O
defy O
him--if O
he O
finds O
me O
going O
there, O
in O
good O
temper, O
year O
after O
year, O
and O
saying O
Uncle O
Scrooge, O
how O
are O
you? O
If O
it O
only O
puts O
him O
in O
the O
vein O
to O
leave O
his O
poor O
clerk O
fifty O
pounds, O
that's O
something; O
and O
I O
think O
I O
shook O
him O
yesterday." O
 O
It O
was O
their O
turn O
to O
laugh O
now O
at O
the O
notion O
of O
his O
shaking O
Scrooge. O
But O
being O
thoroughly O
good-natured, O
and O
not O
much O
caring O
what O
they O
laughed O
at, O
so O
that O
they O
laughed O
at O
any O
rate, O
he O
encouraged O
them O
in O
their O
merriment, O
and O
passed O
the O
bottle O
joyously. O
 O
After O
tea, O
they O
had O
some O
music. O
For O
they O
were O
a O
musical O
family, O
and O
knew O
what O
they O
were O
about, O
when O
they O
sung O
a O
Glee O
or O
Catch, O
I O
can O
assure O
you: O
especially O
Topper, O
who O
could O
growl O
away O
in O
the O
bass O
like O
a O
good O
one, O
and O
never O
swell O
the O
large O
veins O
in O
his O
forehead, O
or O
get O
red O
in O
the O
face O
over O
it. O
Scrooge's O
niece O
played O
well O
upon O
the O
harp; O
and O
played O
among O
other O
tunes O
a O
simple O
little O
air O
(a O
mere O
nothing: O
you O
might O
learn O
to O
whistle O
it O
in O
two O
minutes), O
which O
had O
been O
familiar O
to O
the O
child O
who O
fetched O
Scrooge O
from O
the O
boarding-school, O
as O
he O
had O
been O
reminded O
by O
the O
Ghost O
of O
Christmas O
Past. O
When O
this O
strain O
of O
music O
sounded, O
all O
the O
things O
that O
Ghost O
had O
shown O
him, O
came O
upon O
his O
mind; O
he O
softened O
more O
and O
more; O
and O
thought O
that O
if O
he O
could O
have O
listened O
to O
it O
often, O
years O
ago, O
he O
might O
have O
cultivated O
the O
kindnesses O
of O
life O
for O
his O
own O
happiness O
with O
his O
own O
hands, O
without O
resorting O
to O
the O
sexton's O
spade O
that O
buried O
Jacob O
Marley. O
 O
But O
they O
didn't O
devote O
the O
whole O
evening O
to O
music. O
After O
a O
while O
they O
played O
at O
forfeits; O
for O
it O
is O
good O
to O
be O
children O
sometimes, O
and O
never O
better O
than O
at O
Christmas, O
when O
its O
mighty O
Founder O
was O
a O
child O
himself. O
Stop! O
There O
was O
first O
a O
game O
at O
blind-man's O
buff. O
Of O
course O
there O
was. O
And O
I O
no O
more O
believe O
Topper O
was O
really O
blind O
than O
I O
believe O
he O
had O
eyes O
in O
his O
boots. O
My O
opinion O
is, O
that O
it O
was O
a O
done O
thing O
between O
him O
and O
Scrooge's O
nephew; O
and O
that O
the O
Ghost O
of O
Christmas O
Present O
knew O
it. O
The O
way O
he O
went O
after O
that O
plump O
sister O
in O
the O
lace O
tucker, O
was O
an O
outrage O
on O
the O
credulity O
of O
human O
nature. O
Knocking O
down O
the O
fire-irons, O
tumbling O
over O
the O
chairs, O
bumping O
against O
the O
piano, O
smothering O
himself O
among O
the O
curtains, O
wherever O
she O
went, O
there O
went O
he! O
He O
always O
knew O
where O
the O
plump O
sister O
was. O
He O
wouldn't O
catch O
anybody O
else. O
If O
you O
had O
fallen O
up O
against O
him O
(as O
some O
of O
them O
did), O
on O
purpose, O
he O
would O
have O
made O
a O
feint O
of O
endeavouring O
to O
seize O
you, O
which O
would O
have O
been O
an O
affront O
to O
your O
understanding, O
and O
would O
instantly O
have O
sidled O
off O
in O
the O
direction O
of O
the O
plump O
sister. O
She O
often O
cried O
out O
that O
it O
wasn't O
fair; O
and O
it O
really O
was O
not. O
But O
when O
at O
last, O
he O
caught O
her; O
when, O
in O
spite O
of O
all O
her O
silken O
rustlings, O
and O
her O
rapid O
flutterings O
past O
him, O
he O
got O
her O
into O
a O
corner O
whence O
there O
was O
no O
escape; O
then O
his O
conduct O
was O
the O
most O
execrable. O
For O
his O
pretending O
not O
to O
know O
her; O
his O
pretending O
that O
it O
was O
necessary O
to O
touch O
her O
head-dress, O
and O
further O
to O
assure O
himself O
of O
her O
identity O
by O
pressing O
a O
certain O
ring O
upon O
her O
finger, O
and O
a O
certain O
chain O
about O
her O
neck; O
was O
vile, O
monstrous! O
No O
doubt O
she O
told O
him O
her O
opinion O
of O
it, O
when, O
another O
blind-man O
being O
in O
office, O
they O
were O
so O
very O
confidential O
together, O
behind O
the O
curtains. O
 O
Scrooge's O
niece O
was O
not O
one O
of O
the O
blind-man's O
buff O
party, O
but O
was O
made O
comfortable O
with O
a O
large O
chair O
and O
a O
footstool, O
in O
a O
snug O
corner, O
where O
the O
Ghost O
and O
Scrooge O
were O
close O
behind O
her. O
But O
she O
joined O
in O
the O
forfeits, O
and O
loved O
her O
love O
to O
admiration O
with O
all O
the O
letters O
of O
the O
alphabet. O
Likewise O
at O
the O
game O
of O
How, O
When, O
and O
Where, O
she O
was O
very O
great, O
and O
to O
the O
secret O
joy O
of O
Scrooge's O
nephew, O
beat O
her O
sisters O
hollow: O
though O
they O
were O
sharp O
girls O
too, O
as O
Topper O
could O
have O
told O
you. O
There O
might O
have O
been O
twenty O
people O
there, O
young O
and O
old, O
but O
they O
all O
played, O
and O
so O
did O
Scrooge; O
for O
wholly O
forgetting O
in O
the O
interest O
he O
had O
in O
what O
was O
going O
on, O
that O
his O
voice O
made O
no O
sound O
in O
their O
ears, O
he O
sometimes O
came O
out O
with O
his O
guess O
quite O
loud, O
and O
very O
often O
guessed O
quite O
right, O
too; O
for O
the O
sharpest O
needle, O
best O
Whitechapel, O
warranted O
not O
to O
cut O
in O
the O
eye, O
was O
not O
sharper O
than O
Scrooge; O
blunt O
as O
he O
took O
it O
in O
his O
head O
to O
be. O
 O
The O
Ghost O
was O
greatly O
pleased O
to O
find O
him O
in O
this O
mood, O
and O
looked O
upon O
him O
with O
such O
favour, O
that O
he O
begged O
like O
a O
boy O
to O
be O
allowed O
to O
stay O
until O
the O
guests O
departed. O
But O
this O
the O
Spirit O
said O
could O
not O
be O
done. O
 O
"Here O
is O
a O
new O
game," O
said O
Scrooge. O
"One O
half O
hour, O
Spirit, O
only O
one!" O
 O
It O
was O
a O
Game O
called O
Yes O
and O
No, O
where O
Scrooge's O
nephew O
had O
to O
think O
of O
something, O
and O
the O
rest O
must O
find O
out O
what; O
he O
only O
answering O
to O
their O
questions O
yes O
or O
no, O
as O
the O
case O
was. O
The O
brisk O
fire O
of O
questioning O
to O
which O
he O
was O
exposed, O
elicited O
from O
him O
that O
he O
was O
thinking O
of O
an O
animal, O
a O
live O
animal, O
rather O
a O
disagreeable O
animal, O
a O
savage O
animal, O
an O
animal O
that O
growled O
and O
grunted O
sometimes, O
and O
talked O
sometimes, O
and O
lived O
in O
London, O
and O
walked O
about O
the O
streets, O
and O
wasn't O
made O
a O
show O
of, O
and O
wasn't O
led O
by O
anybody, O
and O
didn't O
live O
in O
a O
menagerie, O
and O
was O
never O
killed O
in O
a O
market, O
and O
was O
not O
a O
horse, O
or O
an O
ass, O
or O
a O
cow, O
or O
a O
bull, O
or O
a O
tiger, O
or O
a O
dog, O
or O
a O
pig, O
or O
a O
cat, O
or O
a O
bear. O
At O
every O
fresh O
question O
that O
was O
put O
to O
him, O
this O
nephew O
burst O
into O
a O
fresh O
roar O
of O
laughter; O
and O
was O
so O
inexpressibly O
tickled, O
that O
he O
was O
obliged O
to O
get O
up O
off O
the O
sofa O
and O
stamp. O
At O
last O
the O
plump O
sister, O
falling O
into O
a O
similar O
state, O
cried O
out: O
 O
"I O
have O
found O
it O
out! O
I O
know O
what O
it O
is, O
Fred! O
I O
know O
what O
it O
is!" O
 O
"What O
is O
it?" O
cried O
Fred. O
 O
"It's O
your O
Uncle O
Scro-o-o-o-oge!" O
 O
Which O
it O
certainly O
was. O
Admiration O
was O
the O
universal O
sentiment, O
though O
some O
objected O
that O
the O
reply O
to O
"Is O
it O
a O
bear?" O
ought O
to O
have O
been O
"Yes;" O
inasmuch O
as O
an O
answer O
in O
the O
negative O
was O
sufficient O
to O
have O
diverted O
their O
thoughts O
from O
Mr. O
Scrooge, O
supposing O
they O
had O
ever O
had O
any O
tendency O
that O
way. O
 O
"He O
has O
given O
us O
plenty O
of O
merriment, O
I O
am O
sure," O
said O
Fred, O
"and O
it O
would O
be O
ungrateful O
not O
to O
drink O
his O
health. O
Here O
is O
a O
glass O
of O
mulled O
wine O
ready O
to O
our O
hand O
at O
the O
moment; O
and O
I O
say, O
'Uncle O
Scrooge!'" O
 O
"Well! O
Uncle O
Scrooge!" O
they O
cried. O
 O
"A O
Merry O
Christmas O
and O
a O
Happy O
New O
Year O
to O
the O
old O
man, O
whatever O
he O
is!" O
said O
Scrooge's O
nephew. O
"He O
wouldn't O
take O
it O
from O
me, O
but O
may O
he O
have O
it, O
nevertheless. O
Uncle O
Scrooge!" O
 O
Uncle O
Scrooge O
had O
imperceptibly O
become O
so O
gay O
and O
light O
of O
heart, O
that O
he O
would O
have O
pledged O
the O
unconscious O
company O
in O
return, O
and O
thanked O
them O
in O
an O
inaudible O
speech, O
if O
the O
Ghost O
had O
given O
him O
time. O
But O
the O
whole O
scene O
passed O
off O
in O
the O
breath O
of O
the O
last O
word O
spoken O
by O
his O
nephew; O
and O
he O
and O
the O
Spirit O
were O
again O
upon O
their O
travels. O
 O
Much O
they O
saw, O
and O
far O
they O
went, O
and O
many O
homes O
they O
visited, O
but O
always O
with O
a O
happy O
end. O
The O
Spirit O
stood O
beside O
sick O
beds, O
and O
they O
were O
cheerful; O
on O
foreign O
lands, O
and O
they O
were O
close O
at O
home; O
by O
struggling O
men, O
and O
they O
were O
patient O
in O
their O
greater O
hope; O
by O
poverty, O
and O
it O
was O
rich. O
In O
almshouse, O
hospital, O
and O
jail, O
in O
misery's O
every O
refuge, O
where O
vain O
man O
in O
his O
little O
brief O
authority O
had O
not O
made O
fast O
the O
door, O
and O
barred O
the O
Spirit O
out, O
he O
left O
his O
blessing, O
and O
taught O
Scrooge O
his O
precepts. O
 O
It O
was O
a O
long O
night, O
if O
it O
were O
only O
a O
night; O
but O
Scrooge O
had O
his O
doubts O
of O
this, O
because O
the O
Christmas O
Holidays O
appeared O
to O
be O
condensed O
into O
the O
space O
of O
time O
they O
passed O
together. O
It O
was O
strange, O
too, O
that O
while O
Scrooge O
remained O
unaltered O
in O
his O
outward O
form, O
the O
Ghost O
grew O
older, O
clearly O
older. O
Scrooge O
had O
observed O
this O
change, O
but O
never O
spoke O
of O
it, O
until O
they O
left O
a O
children's O
Twelfth O
Night O
party, O
when, O
looking O
at O
the O
Spirit O
as O
they O
stood O
together O
in O
an O
open O
place, O
he O
noticed O
that O
its O
hair O
was O
grey. O
 O
"Are O
spirits' O
lives O
so O
short?" O
asked O
Scrooge. O
 O
"My O
life O
upon O
this O
globe, O
is O
very O
brief," O
replied O
the O
Ghost. O
"It O
ends O
to-night." O
 O
"To-night!" O
cried O
Scrooge. O
 O
"To-night O
at O
midnight. O
Hark! O
The O
time O
is O
drawing O
near." O
 O
The O
chimes O
were O
ringing O
the O
three O
quarters O
past O
eleven O
at O
that O
moment. O
 O
"Forgive O
me O
if O
I O
am O
not O
justified O
in O
what O
I O
ask," O
said O
Scrooge, O
looking O
intently O
at O
the O
Spirit's O
robe, O
"but O
I O
see O
something O
strange, O
and O
not O
belonging O
to O
yourself, O
protruding O
from O
your O
skirts. O
Is O
it O
a O
foot O
or O
a O
claw?" O
 O
"It O
might O
be O
a O
claw, O
for O
the O
flesh O
there O
is O
upon O
it," O
was O
the O
Spirit's O
sorrowful O
reply. O
"Look O
here." O
 O
From O
the O
foldings O
of O
its O
robe, O
it O
brought O
two O
children; O
wretched, O
abject, O
frightful, O
hideous, O
miserable. O
They O
knelt O
down O
at O
its O
feet, O
and O
clung O
upon O
the O
outside O
of O
its O
garment. O
 O
"Oh, O
Man! O
look O
here. O
Look, O
look, O
down O
here!" O
exclaimed O
the O
Ghost. O
 O
They O
were O
a O
boy O
and O
girl. O
Yellow, O
meagre, O
ragged, O
scowling, O
wolfish; O
but O
prostrate, O
too, O
in O
their O
humility. O
Where O
graceful O
youth O
should O
have O
filled O
their O
features O
out, O
and O
touched O
them O
with O
its O
freshest O
tints, O
a O
stale O
and O
shrivelled O
hand, O
like O
that O
of O
age, O
had O
pinched, O
and O
twisted O
them, O
and O
pulled O
them O
into O
shreds. O
Where O
angels O
might O
have O
sat O
enthroned, O
devils O
lurked, O
and O
glared O
out O
menacing. O
No O
change, O
no O
degradation, O
no O
perversion O
of O
humanity, O
in O
any O
grade, O
through O
all O
the O
mysteries O
of O
wonderful O
creation, O
has O
monsters O
half O
so O
horrible O
and O
dread. O
 O
Scrooge O
started O
back, O
appalled. O
Having O
them O
shown O
to O
him O
in O
this O
way, O
he O
tried O
to O
say O
they O
were O
fine O
children, O
but O
the O
words O
choked O
themselves, O
rather O
than O
be O
parties O
to O
a O
lie O
of O
such O
enormous O
magnitude. O
 O
"Spirit! O
are O
they O
yours?" O
Scrooge O
could O
say O
no O
more. O
 O
"They O
are O
Man's," O
said O
the O
Spirit, O
looking O
down O
upon O
them. O
"And O
they O
cling O
to O
me, O
appealing O
from O
their O
fathers. O
This O
boy O
is O
Ignorance. O
This O
girl O
is O
Want. O
Beware O
them O
both, O
and O
all O
of O
their O
degree, O
but O
most O
of O
all O
beware O
this O
boy, O
for O
on O
his O
brow O
I O
see O
that O
written O
which O
is O
Doom, O
unless O
the O
writing O
be O
erased. O
Deny O
it!" O
cried O
the O
Spirit, O
stretching O
out O
its O
hand O
towards O
the O
city. O
"Slander O
those O
who O
tell O
it O
ye! O
Admit O
it O
for O
your O
factious O
purposes, O
and O
make O
it O
worse. O
And O
bide O
the O
end!" O
 O
"Have O
they O
no O
refuge O
or O
resource?" O
cried O
Scrooge. O
 O
"Are O
there O
no O
prisons?" O
said O
the O
Spirit, O
turning O
on O
him O
for O
the O
last O
time O
with O
his O
own O
words. O
"Are O
there O
no O
workhouses?" O
 O
The O
bell O
struck O
twelve. O
 O
Scrooge O
looked O
about O
him O
for O
the O
Ghost, O
and O
saw O
it O
not. O
As O
the O
last O
stroke O
ceased O
to O
vibrate, O
he O
remembered O
the O
prediction O
of O
old O
Jacob O
Marley, O
and O
lifting O
up O
his O
eyes, O
beheld O
a O
solemn O
Phantom, O
draped O
and O
hooded, O
coming, O
like O
a O
mist O
along O
the O
ground, O
towards O
him. O
The O
Phantom O
slowly, O
gravely, O
silently, O
approached. O
When O
it O
came O
near O
him, O
Scrooge O
bent O
down O
upon O
his O
knee; O
for O
in O
the O
very O
air O
through O
which O
this O
Spirit O
moved O
it O
seemed O
to O
scatter O
gloom O
and O
mystery. O
 O
It O
was O
shrouded O
in O
a O
deep O
black O
garment, O
which O
concealed O
its O
head, O
its O
face, O
its O
form, O
and O
left O
nothing O
of O
it O
visible O
save O
one O
outstretched O
hand. O
But O
for O
this O
it O
would O
have O
been O
difficult O
to O
detach O
its O
figure O
from O
the O
night, O
and O
separate O
it O
from O
the O
darkness O
by O
which O
it O
was O
surrounded. O
 O
He O
felt O
that O
it O
was O
tall O
and O
stately O
when O
it O
came O
beside O
him, O
and O
that O
its O
mysterious O
presence O
filled O
him O
with O
a O
solemn O
dread. O
He O
knew O
no O
more, O
for O
the O
Spirit O
neither O
spoke O
nor O
moved. O
 O
"I O
am O
in O
the O
presence O
of O
the O
Ghost O
of O
Christmas O
Yet O
To O
Come?" O
said O
Scrooge. O
 O
The O
Spirit O
answered O
not, O
but O
pointed O
downward O
with O
its O
hand. O
 O
"You O
are O
about O
to O
show O
me O
shadows O
of O
the O
things O
that O
have O
not O
happened, O
but O
will O
happen O
in O
the O
time O
before O
us," O
Scrooge O
pursued. O
"Is O
that O
so, O
Spirit?" O
 O
The O
upper O
portion O
of O
the O
garment O
was O
contracted O
for O
an O
instant O
in O
its O
folds, O
as O
if O
the O
Spirit O
had O
inclined O
its O
head. O
That O
was O
the O
only O
answer O
he O
received. O
 O
Although O
well O
used O
to O
ghostly O
company O
by O
this O
time, O
Scrooge O
feared O
the O
silent O
shape O
so O
much O
that O
his O
legs O
trembled O
beneath O
him, O
and O
he O
found O
that O
he O
could O
hardly O
stand O
when O
he O
prepared O
to O
follow O
it. O
The O
Spirit O
paused O
a O
moment, O
as O
observing O
his O
condition, O
and O
giving O
him O
time O
to O
recover. O
 O
But O
Scrooge O
was O
all O
the O
worse O
for O
this. O
It O
thrilled O
him O
with O
a O
vague O
uncertain O
horror, O
to O
know O
that O
behind O
the O
dusky O
shroud O
there O
were O
ghostly O
eyes O
intently O
fixed O
upon O
him, O
while O
he, O
though O
he O
stretched O
his O
own O
to O
the O
utmost, O
could O
see O
nothing O
but O
a O
spectral O
hand O
and O
one O
great O
heap O
of O
black. O
 O
"Ghost O
of O
the O
Future!" O
he O
exclaimed, O
"I O
fear O
you O
more O
than O
any O
Spectre O
I O
have O
seen. O
But, O
as O
I O
know O
your O
purpose O
is O
to O
do O
me O
good, O
and O
as O
I O
hope O
to O
live O
to O
be O
another O
man O
from O
what O
I O
was, O
I O
am O
prepared O
to O
bear O
you O
company, O
and O
do O
it O
with O
a O
thankful O
heart. O
Will O
you O
not O
speak O
to O
me?" O
 O
It O
gave O
him O
no O
reply. O
The O
hand O
was O
pointed O
straight O
before O
them. O
 O
"Lead O
on!" O
said O
Scrooge. O
"Lead O
on! O
The O
night O
is O
waning O
fast, O
and O
it O
is O
precious O
time O
to O
me, O
I O
know. O
Lead O
on, O
Spirit!" O
 O
The O
Phantom O
moved O
away O
as O
it O
had O
come O
towards O
him, O
Scrooge O
followed O
in O
the O
shadow O
of O
its O
dress, O
which O
bore O
him O
up, O
he O
thought, O
and O
carried O
him O
along. O
 O
They O
scarcely O
seemed O
to O
enter O
the O
city; O
for O
the O
city O
rather O
seemed O
to O
spring O
up O
about O
them, O
and O
encompass O
them O
of O
its O
own O
act. O
But O
there O
they O
were, O
in O
the O
heart O
of O
it; O
on O
'Change, O
amongst O
the O
merchants; O
who O
hurried O
up O
and O
down, O
and O
chinked O
the O
money O
in O
their O
pockets, O
and O
conversed O
in O
groups, O
and O
looked O
at O
their O
watches, O
and O
trifled O
thoughtfully O
with O
their O
great O
gold O
seals; O
and O
so O
forth, O
as O
Scrooge O
had O
seen O
them O
often. O
 O
The O
Spirit O
stopped O
beside O
one O
little O
knot O
of O
business O
men. O
Observing O
that O
the O
hand O
was O
pointed O
to O
them, O
Scrooge O
advanced O
to O
listen O
to O
their O
talk. O
 O
"No," O
said O
a O
great O
fat O
man O
with O
a O
monstrous O
chin, O
"I O
don't O
know O
much O
about O
it, O
either O
way. O
I O
only O
know O
he's O
dead." O
 O
"When O
did O
he O
die?" O
inquired O
another. O
 O
"Last O
night, O
I O
believe." O
 O
"Why, O
what O
was O
the O
matter O
with O
him?" O
asked O
a O
third, O
taking O
a O
vast O
quantity O
of O
snuff O
out O
of O
a O
very O
large O
snuff-box. O
"I O
thought O
he'd O
never O
die." O
 O
"God O
knows," O
said O
the O
first, O
with O
a O
yawn. O
 O
"What O
has O
he O
done O
with O
his O
money?" O
asked O
a O
red-faced O
gentleman O
with O
a O
pendulous O
excrescence O
on O
the O
end O
of O
his O
nose, O
that O
shook O
like O
the O
gills O
of O
a O
turkey-cock. O
 O
"I O
haven't O
heard," O
said O
the O
man O
with O
the O
large O
chin, O
yawning O
again. O
"Left O
it O
to O
his O
Company, O
perhaps. O
He O
hasn't O
left O
it O
to O
me. O
That's O
all O
know." O
 O
This O
pleasantry O
was O
received O
with O
a O
general O
laugh. O
 O
"It's O
likely O
to O
be O
a O
very O
cheap O
funeral," O
said O
the O
same O
speaker; O
"for O
upon O
my O
life O
I O
don't O
know O
of O
anybody O
to O
go O
to O
it. O
Suppose O
we O
make O
up O
a O
party O
and O
volunteer?" O
 O
"I O
don't O
mind O
going O
if O
a O
lunch O
is O
provided," O
observed O
the O
gentleman O
with O
the O
excrescence O
on O
his O
nose. O
"But O
I O
must O
be O
fed, O
if O
I O
make O
one." O
 O
Another O
laugh. O
 O
"Well, O
I O
am O
the O
most O
disinterested O
among O
you, O
after O
all," O
said O
the O
first O
speaker, O
"for O
I O
never O
wear O
black O
gloves, O
and O
I O
never O
eat O
lunch. O
But O
I'll O
offer O
to O
go, O
if O
anybody O
else O
will. O
When O
I O
come O
to O
think O
of O
it, O
I'm O
not O
at O
all O
sure O
that O
I O
wasn't O
his O
most O
particular O
friend; O
for O
we O
used O
to O
stop O
and O
speak O
whenever O
we O
met. O
Bye, O
bye!" O
 O
Speakers O
and O
listeners O
strolled O
away, O
and O
mixed O
with O
other O
groups. O
Scrooge O
knew O
the O
men, O
and O
looked O
towards O
the O
Spirit O
for O
an O
explanation. O
 O
The O
Phantom O
glided O
on O
into O
a O
street. O
Its O
finger O
pointed O
to O
two O
persons O
meeting. O
Scrooge O
listened O
again, O
thinking O
that O
the O
explanation O
might O
lie O
here. O
 O
He O
knew O
these O
men, O
also, O
perfectly. O
They O
were O
men O
of O
business: O
very O
wealthy, O
and O
of O
great O
importance. O
He O
had O
made O
a O
point O
always O
of O
standing O
well O
in O
their O
esteem: O
in O
a O
business O
point O
of O
view, O
that O
is; O
strictly O
in O
a O
business O
point O
of O
view. O
 O
"How O
are O
you?" O
said O
one. O
 O
"How O
are O
you?" O
returned O
the O
other. O
 O
"Well!" O
said O
the O
first. O
"Old O
Scratch O
has O
got O
his O
own O
at O
last, O
hey?" O
 O
"So O
I O
am O
told," O
returned O
the O
second. O
"Cold, O
isn't O
it?" O
 O
"Seasonable O
for O
Christmas O
time. O
You're O
not O
a O
skaiter, O
I O
suppose?" O
 O
"No. O
No. O
Something O
else O
to O
think O
of. O
Good O
morning!" O
 O
Not O
another O
word. O
That O
was O
their O
meeting, O
their O
conversation, O
and O
their O
parting. O
 O
Scrooge O
was O
at O
first O
inclined O
to O
be O
surprised O
that O
the O
Spirit O
should O
attach O
importance O
to O
conversations O
apparently O
so O
trivial; O
but O
feeling O
assured O
that O
they O
must O
have O
some O
hidden O
purpose, O
he O
set O
himself O
to O
consider O
what O
it O
was O
likely O
to O
be. O
They O
could O
scarcely O
be O
supposed O
to O
have O
any O
bearing O
on O
the O
death O
of O
Jacob, O
his O
old O
partner, O
for O
that O
was O
Past, O
and O
this O
Ghost's O
province O
was O
the O
Future. O
Nor O
could O
he O
think O
of O
any O
one O
immediately O
connected O
with O
himself, O
to O
whom O
he O
could O
apply O
them. O
But O
nothing O
doubting O
that O
to O
whomsoever O
they O
applied O
they O
had O
some O
latent O
moral O
for O
his O
own O
improvement, O
he O
resolved O
to O
treasure O
up O
every O
word O
he O
heard, O
and O
everything O
he O
saw; O
and O
especially O
to O
observe O
the O
shadow O
of O
himself O
when O
it O
appeared. O
For O
he O
had O
an O
expectation O
that O
the O
conduct O
of O
his O
future O
self O
would O
give O
him O
the O
clue O
he O
missed, O
and O
would O
render O
the O
solution O
of O
these O
riddles O
easy. O
 O
He O
looked O
about O
in O
that O
very O
place O
for O
his O
own O
image; O
but O
another O
man O
stood O
in O
his O
accustomed O
corner, O
and O
though O
the O
clock O
pointed O
to O
his O
usual O
time O
of O
day O
for O
being O
there, O
he O
saw O
no O
likeness O
of O
himself O
among O
the O
multitudes O
that O
poured O
in O
through O
the O
Porch. O
It O
gave O
him O
little O
surprise, O
however; O
for O
he O
had O
been O
revolving O
in O
his O
mind O
a O
change O
of O
life, O
and O
thought O
and O
hoped O
he O
saw O
his O
new-born O
resolutions O
carried O
out O
in O
this. O
 O
Quiet O
and O
dark, O
beside O
him O
stood O
the O
Phantom, O
with O
its O
outstretched O
hand. O
When O
he O
roused O
himself O
from O
his O
thoughtful O
quest, O
he O
fancied O
from O
the O
turn O
of O
the O
hand, O
and O
its O
situation O
in O
reference O
to O
himself, O
that O
the O
Unseen O
Eyes O
were O
looking O
at O
him O
keenly. O
It O
made O
him O
shudder, O
and O
feel O
very O
cold. O
 O
They O
left O
the O
busy O
scene, O
and O
went O
into O
an O
obscure O
part O
of O
the O
town, O
where O
Scrooge O
had O
never O
penetrated O
before, O
although O
he O
recognised O
its O
situation, O
and O
its O
bad O
repute. O
The O
ways O
were O
foul O
and O
narrow; O
the O
shops O
and O
houses O
wretched; O
the O
people O
half-naked, O
drunken, O
slipshod, O
ugly. O
Alleys O
and O
archways, O
like O
so O
many O
cesspools, O
disgorged O
their O
offences O
of O
smell, O
and O
dirt, O
and O
life, O
upon O
the O
straggling O
streets; O
and O
the O
whole O
quarter O
reeked O
with O
crime, O
with O
filth, O
and O
misery. O
 O
Far O
in O
this O
den O
of O
infamous O
resort, O
there O
was O
a O
low-browed, O
beetling O
shop, O
below O
a O
pent-house O
roof O
where O
iron, O
old O
rags, O
bottles, O
bones, O
and O
greasy O
offal, O
were O
bought. O
Upon O
the O
floor O
within, O
were O
piled O
up O
heaps O
of O
rusty O
keys, O
nails, O
chains, O
hinges, O
files, O
scales, O
weights, O
and O
refuse O
iron O
of O
all O
kinds. O
Secrets O
that O
few O
would O
like O
to O
scrutinise O
were O
bred O
and O
hidden O
in O
mountains O
of O
unseemly O
rags, O
masses O
of O
corrupted O
fat, O
and O
sepulchres O
of O
bones. O
Sitting O
in O
among O
the O
wares O
he O
dealt O
in, O
by O
a O
charcoal-stove, O
made O
of O
old O
bricks, O
was O
a O
gray-haired O
rascal, O
nearly O
seventy O
years O
of O
age; O
who O
had O
screened O
himself O
from O
the O
cold O
air O
without, O
by O
a O
frousy O
curtaining O
of O
miscellaneous O
tatters, O
hung O
upon O
a O
line; O
and O
smoked O
his O
pipe O
in O
all O
the O
luxury O
of O
calm O
retirement. O
 O
Scrooge O
and O
the O
Phantom O
came O
into O
the O
presence O
of O
this O
man, O
just O
as O
a O
woman O
with O
a O
heavy O
bundle O
slunk O
into O
the O
shop. O
But O
she O
had O
scarcely O
entered, O
when O
another O
woman, O
similarly O
laden, O
came O
in O
too; O
and O
she O
was O
closely O
followed O
by O
a O
man O
in O
faded O
black, O
who O
was O
no O
less O
startled O
by O
the O
sight O
of O
them, O
than O
they O
had O
been O
upon O
the O
recognition O
of O
each O
other. O
After O
a O
short O
period O
of O
blank O
astonishment, O
in O
which O
the O
old O
man O
with O
the O
pipe O
had O
joined O
them, O
they O
all O
three O
burst O
into O
a O
laugh. O
 O
"Let O
the O
charwoman O
alone O
to O
be O
the O
first!" O
cried O
she O
who O
had O
entered O
first. O
"Let O
the O
laundress O
alone O
to O
be O
the O
second; O
and O
let O
the O
undertaker's O
man O
alone O
to O
be O
the O
third. O
Look O
here, O
old O
Joe, O
here's O
a O
chance! O
If O
we O
haven't O
all O
three O
met O
here O
without O
meaning O
it!" O
 O
"You O
couldn't O
have O
met O
in O
a O
better O
place," O
said O
old O
Joe, O
removing O
his O
pipe O
from O
his O
mouth. O
"Come O
into O
the O
parlour. O
You O
were O
made O
free O
of O
it O
long O
ago, O
you O
know; O
and O
the O
other O
two O
an't O
strangers. O
Stop O
till O
I O
shut O
the O
door O
of O
the O
shop. O
Ah! O
How O
it O
skreeks! O
There O
an't O
such O
a O
rusty O
bit O
of O
metal O
in O
the O
place O
as O
its O
own O
hinges, O
I O
believe; O
and O
I'm O
sure O
there's O
no O
such O
old O
bones O
here, O
as O
mine. O
Ha, O
ha! O
We're O
all O
suitable O
to O
our O
calling, O
we're O
well O
matched. O
Come O
into O
the O
parlour. O
Come O
into O
the O
parlour." O
 O
The O
parlour O
was O
the O
space O
behind O
the O
screen O
of O
rags. O
The O
old O
man O
raked O
the O
fire O
together O
with O
an O
old O
stair-rod, O
and O
having O
trimmed O
his O
smoky O
lamp O
(for O
it O
was O
night), O
with O
the O
stem O
of O
his O
pipe, O
put O
it O
in O
his O
mouth O
again. O
 O
While O
he O
did O
this, O
the O
woman O
who O
had O
already O
spoken, O
threw O
her O
bundle O
on O
the O
floor O
and O
sat O
down O
in O
a O
flaunting O
manner O
on O
a O
stool; O
crossing O
her O
elbows O
on O
her O
knees, O
and O
looking O
with O
a O
bold O
defiance O
at O
the O
other O
two. O
 O
"What O
odds O
then! O
What O
odds, O
Mrs. O
Dilber?" O
said O
the O
woman. O
"Every O
person O
has O
a O
right O
to O
take O
care O
of O
themselves. O
He O
always O
did!" O
 O
"That's O
true, O
indeed!" O
said O
the O
laundress. O
"No O
man O
more O
so." O
 O
"Why, O
then, O
don't O
stand O
staring O
as O
if O
you O
was O
afraid, O
woman; O
who's O
the O
wiser? O
We're O
not O
going O
to O
pick O
holes O
in O
each O
other's O
coats, O
I O
suppose?" O
 O
"No, O
indeed!" O
said O
Mrs. O
Dilber O
and O
the O
man O
together. O
"We O
should O
hope O
not." O
 O
"Very O
well, O
then!" O
cried O
the O
woman. O
"That's O
enough. O
Who's O
the O
worse O
for O
the O
loss O
of O
a O
few O
things O
like O
these? O
Not O
a O
dead O
man, O
I O
suppose." O
 O
"No, O
indeed," O
said O
Mrs. O
Dilber, O
laughing. O
 O
"If O
he O
wanted O
to O
keep O
'em O
after O
he O
was O
dead, O
a O
wicked O
old O
screw," O
pursued O
the O
woman, O
"why O
wasn't O
he O
natural O
in O
his O
lifetime? O
If O
he O
had O
been, O
he'd O
have O
had O
somebody O
to O
look O
after O
him O
when O
he O
was O
struck O
with O
Death, O
instead O
of O
lying O
gasping O
out O
his O
last O
there, O
alone O
by O
himself." O
 O
"It's O
the O
truest O
word O
that O
ever O
was O
spoke," O
said O
Mrs. O
Dilber. O
"It's O
a O
judgment O
on O
him." O
 O
"I O
wish O
it O
was O
a O
little O
heavier O
one," O
replied O
the O
woman: O
"and O
it O
should O
have O
been, O
you O
may O
depend O
upon O
it, O
if O
I O
could O
have O
laid O
my O
hands O
on O
anything O
else. O
Open O
that O
bundle, O
old O
Joe, O
and O
let O
me O
know O
the O
value O
of O
it. O
Speak O
out O
plain. O
I'm O
not O
afraid O
to O
be O
the O
first, O
nor O
afraid O
for O
them O
to O
see O
it. O
We O
knew O
pretty O
well O
that O
we O
were O
helping O
ourselves, O
before O
we O
met O
here, O
I O
believe. O
It's O
no O
sin. O
Open O
the O
bundle, O
Joe." O
 O
But O
the O
gallantry O
of O
her O
friends O
would O
not O
allow O
of O
this; O
and O
the O
man O
in O
faded O
black, O
mounting O
the O
breach O
first, O
produced O
his O
plunder. O
It O
was O
not O
extensive. O
A O
seal O
or O
two, O
a O
pencil-case, O
a O
pair O
of O
sleeve-buttons, O
and O
a O
brooch O
of O
no O
great O
value, O
were O
all. O
They O
were O
severally O
examined O
and O
appraised O
by O
old O
Joe, O
who O
chalked O
the O
sums O
he O
was O
disposed O
to O
give O
for O
each O
upon O
the O
wall, O
and O
added O
them O
up O
into O
a O
total O
when O
he O
found O
that O
there O
was O
nothing O
more O
to O
come. O
 O
"That's O
your O
account," O
said O
Joe, O
"and O
I O
wouldn't O
give O
another O
sixpence, O
if O
I O
was O
to O
be O
boiled O
for O
not O
doing O
it. O
Who's O
next?" O
 O
Mrs. O
Dilber O
was O
next. O
Sheets O
and O
towels, O
a O
little O
wearing O
apparel, O
two O
old-fashioned O
silver O
teaspoons, O
a O
pair O
of O
sugar-tongs, O
and O
a O
few O
boots. O
Her O
account O
was O
stated O
on O
the O
wall O
in O
the O
same O
manner. O
 O
"I O
always O
give O
too O
much O
to O
ladies. O
It's O
a O
weakness O
of O
mine, O
and O
that's O
the O
way O
I O
ruin O
myself," O
said O
old O
Joe. O
"That's O
your O
account. O
If O
you O
asked O
me O
for O
another O
penny, O
and O
made O
it O
an O
open O
question, O
I'd O
repent O
of O
being O
so O
liberal, O
and O
knock O
off O
half-a-crown." O
 O
"And O
now O
undo O
my O
bundle, O
Joe," O
said O
the O
first O
woman. O
 O
Joe O
went O
down O
on O
his O
knees O
for O
the O
greater O
convenience O
of O
opening O
it, O
and O
having O
unfastened O
a O
great O
many O
knots, O
dragged O
out O
a O
large O
and O
heavy O
roll O
of O
some O
dark O
stuff. O
 O
"What O
do O
you O
call O
this?" O
said O
Joe. O
"Bed-curtains!" O
 O
"Ah!" O
returned O
the O
woman, O
laughing O
and O
leaning O
forward O
on O
her O
crossed O
arms. O
"Bed-curtains!" O
 O
"You O
don't O
mean O
to O
say O
you O
took O
'em O
down, O
rings O
and O
all, O
with O
him O
lying O
there?" O
said O
Joe. O
 O
"Yes O
I O
do," O
replied O
the O
woman. O
"Why O
not?" O
 O
"You O
were O
born O
to O
make O
your O
fortune," O
said O
Joe, O
"and O
you'll O
certainly O
do O
it." O
 O
"I O
certainly O
shan't O
hold O
my O
hand, O
when O
I O
can O
get O
anything O
in O
it O
by O
reaching O
it O
out, O
for O
the O
sake O
of O
such O
a O
man O
as O
He O
was, O
I O
promise O
you, O
Joe," O
returned O
the O
woman O
coolly. O
"Don't O
drop O
that O
oil O
upon O
the O
blankets, O
now." O
 O
"His O
blankets?" O
asked O
Joe. O
 O
"Whose O
else's O
do O
you O
think?" O
replied O
the O
woman. O
"He O
isn't O
likely O
to O
take O
cold O
without O
'em, O
I O
dare O
say." O
 O
"I O
hope O
he O
didn't O
die O
of O
anything O
catching? O
Eh?" O
said O
old O
Joe, O
stopping O
in O
his O
work, O
and O
looking O
up. O
 O
"Don't O
you O
be O
afraid O
of O
that," O
returned O
the O
woman. O
"I O
an't O
so O
fond O
of O
his O
company O
that O
I'd O
loiter O
about O
him O
for O
such O
things, O
if O
he O
did. O
Ah! O
You O
may O
look O
through O
that O
shirt O
till O
your O
eyes O
ache; O
but O
you O
won't O
find O
a O
hole O
in O
it, O
nor O
a O
threadbare O
place. O
It's O
the O
best O
he O
had, O
and O
a O
fine O
one O
too. O
They'd O
have O
wasted O
it, O
if O
it O
hadn't O
been O
for O
me." O
 O
"What O
do O
you O
call O
wasting O
of O
it?" O
asked O
old O
Joe. O
 O
"Putting O
it O
on O
him O
to O
be O
buried O
in, O
to O
be O
sure," O
replied O
the O
woman O
with O
a O
laugh. O
"Somebody O
was O
fool O
enough O
to O
do O
it, O
but O
I O
took O
it O
off O
again. O
If O
calico O
an't O
good O
enough O
for O
such O
a O
purpose, O
it O
isn't O
good O
enough O
for O
anything. O
It's O
quite O
as O
becoming O
to O
the O
body. O
He O
can't O
look O
uglier O
than O
he O
did O
in O
that O
one." O
 O
Scrooge O
listened O
to O
this O
dialogue O
in O
horror. O
As O
they O
sat O
grouped O
about O
their O
spoil, O
in O
the O
scanty O
light O
afforded O
by O
the O
old O
man's O
lamp, O
he O
viewed O
them O
with O
a O
detestation O
and O
disgust, O
which O
could O
hardly O
have O
been O
greater, O
though O
they O
had O
been O
obscene O
demons, O
marketing O
the O
corpse O
itself. O
 O
"Ha, O
ha!" O
laughed O
the O
same O
woman, O
when O
old O
Joe, O
producing O
a O
flannel O
bag O
with O
money O
in O
it, O
told O
out O
their O
several O
gains O
upon O
the O
ground. O
"This O
is O
the O
end O
of O
it, O
you O
see! O
He O
frightened O
every O
one O
away O
from O
him O
when O
he O
was O
alive, O
to O
profit O
us O
when O
he O
was O
dead! O
Ha, O
ha, O
ha!" O
 O
"Spirit!" O
said O
Scrooge, O
shuddering O
from O
head O
to O
foot. O
"I O
see, O
I O
see. O
The O
case O
of O
this O
unhappy O
man O
might O
be O
my O
own. O
My O
life O
tends O
that O
way, O
now. O
Merciful O
Heaven, O
what O
is O
this!" O
 O
He O
recoiled O
in O
terror, O
for O
the O
scene O
had O
changed, O
and O
now O
he O
almost O
touched O
a O
bed: O
a O
bare, O
uncurtained O
bed: O
on O
which, O
beneath O
a O
ragged O
sheet, O
there O
lay O
a O
something O
covered O
up, O
which, O
though O
it O
was O
dumb, O
announced O
itself O
in O
awful O
language. O
 O
The O
room O
was O
very O
dark, O
too O
dark O
to O
be O
observed O
with O
any O
accuracy, O
though O
Scrooge O
glanced O
round O
it O
in O
obedience O
to O
a O
secret O
impulse, O
anxious O
to O
know O
what O
kind O
of O
room O
it O
was. O
A O
pale O
light, O
rising O
in O
the O
outer O
air, O
fell O
straight O
upon O
the O
bed; O
and O
on O
it, O
plundered O
and O
bereft, O
unwatched, O
unwept, O
uncared O
for, O
was O
the O
body O
of O
this O
man. O
 O
Scrooge O
glanced O
towards O
the O
Phantom. O
Its O
steady O
hand O
was O
pointed O
to O
the O
head. O
The O
cover O
was O
so O
carelessly O
adjusted O
that O
the O
slightest O
raising O
of O
it, O
the O
motion O
of O
a O
finger O
upon O
Scrooge's O
part, O
would O
have O
disclosed O
the O
face. O
He O
thought O
of O
it, O
felt O
how O
easy O
it O
would O
be O
to O
do, O
and O
longed O
to O
do O
it; O
but O
had O
no O
more O
power O
to O
withdraw O
the O
veil O
than O
to O
dismiss O
the O
spectre O
at O
his O
side. O
 O
Oh O
cold, O
cold, O
rigid, O
dreadful O
Death, O
set O
up O
thine O
altar O
here, O
and O
dress O
it O
with O
such O
terrors O
as O
thou O
hast O
at O
thy O
command: O
for O
this O
is O
thy O
dominion! O
But O
of O
the O
loved, O
revered, O
and O
honoured O
head, O
thou O
canst O
not O
turn O
one O
hair O
to O
thy O
dread O
purposes, O
or O
make O
one O
feature O
odious. O
It O
is O
not O
that O
the O
hand O
is O
heavy O
and O
will O
fall O
down O
when O
released; O
it O
is O
not O
that O
the O
heart O
and O
pulse O
are O
still; O
but O
that O
the O
hand O
was O
open, O
generous, O
and O
true; O
the O
heart O
brave, O
warm, O
and O
tender; O
and O
the O
pulse O
a O
man's. O
Strike, O
Shadow, O
strike! O
And O
see O
his O
good O
deeds O
springing O
from O
the O
wound, O
to O
sow O
the O
world O
with O
life O
immortal! O
 O
No O
voice O
pronounced O
these O
words O
in O
Scrooge's O
ears, O
and O
yet O
he O
heard O
them O
when O
he O
looked O
upon O
the O
bed. O
He O
thought, O
if O
this O
man O
could O
be O
raised O
up O
now, O
what O
would O
be O
his O
foremost O
thoughts? O
Avarice, O
hard O
dealing, O
griping O
cares? O
They O
have O
brought O
him O
to O
a O
rich O
end, O
truly! O
 O
He O
lay, O
in O
the O
dark O
empty O
house, O
with O
not O
a O
man, O
a O
woman, O
or O
a O
child, O
to O
say O
he O
was O
kind O
to O
me O
in O
this O
or O
that, O
and O
for O
the O
memory O
of O
one O
kind O
word O
I O
will O
be O
kind O
to O
him. O
A O
cat O
was O
tearing O
at O
the O
door, O
and O
there O
was O
a O
sound O
of O
gnawing O
rats O
beneath O
the O
hearth-stone. O
What O
they O
wanted O
in O
the O
room O
of O
death, O
and O
why O
they O
were O
so O
restless O
and O
disturbed, O
Scrooge O
did O
not O
dare O
to O
think. O
 O
"Spirit!" O
he O
said, O
"this O
is O
a O
fearful O
place. O
In O
leaving O
it, O
I O
shall O
not O
leave O
its O
lesson, O
trust O
me. O
Let O
us O
go!" O
 O
Still O
the O
Ghost O
pointed O
with O
an O
unmoved O
finger O
to O
the O
head. O
 O
"I O
understand O
you," O
Scrooge O
returned, O
"and O
I O
would O
do O
it, O
if O
I O
could. O
But O
I O
have O
not O
the O
power, O
Spirit. O
I O
have O
not O
the O
power." O
 O
Again O
it O
seemed O
to O
look O
upon O
him. O
 O
"If O
there O
is O
any O
person O
in O
the O
town, O
who O
feels O
emotion O
caused O
by O
this O
man's O
death," O
said O
Scrooge O
quite O
agonized, O
"show O
that O
person O
to O
me, O
Spirit, O
I O
beseech O
you!" O
 O
The O
phantom O
spread O
its O
dark O
robe O
before O
him O
for O
a O
moment, O
like O
a O
wing; O
and O
withdrawing O
it, O
revealed O
a O
room O
by O
daylight, O
where O
a O
mother O
and O
her O
children O
were. O
 O
She O
was O
expecting O
some O
one, O
and O
with O
anxious O
eagerness; O
for O
she O
walked O
up O
and O
down O
the O
room; O
started O
at O
every O
sound; O
looked O
out O
from O
the O
window; O
glanced O
at O
the O
clock; O
tried, O
but O
in O
vain, O
to O
work O
with O
her O
needle; O
and O
could O
hardly O
bear O
the O
voices O
of O
the O
children O
in O
their O
play. O
 O
At O
length O
the O
long-expected O
knock O
was O
heard. O
She O
hurried O
to O
the O
door, O
and O
met O
her O
husband; O
a O
man O
whose O
face O
was O
care-worn O
and O
depressed, O
though O
he O
was O
young. O
There O
was O
a O
remarkable O
expression O
in O
it O
now; O
a O
kind O
of O
serious O
delight O
of O
which O
he O
felt O
ashamed, O
and O
which O
he O
struggled O
to O
repress. O
 O
He O
sat O
down O
to O
the O
dinner O
that O
had O
been O
hoarding O
for O
him O
by O
the O
fire; O
and O
when O
she O
asked O
him O
faintly O
what O
news O
(which O
was O
not O
until O
after O
a O
long O
silence), O
he O
appeared O
embarrassed O
how O
to O
answer. O
 O
"Is O
it O
good," O
she O
said, O
"or O
bad?"—to O
help O
him. O
 O
"Bad," O
he O
answered. O
 O
"We O
are O
quite O
ruined?" O
 O
"No. O
There O
is O
hope O
yet, O
Caroline." O
 O
"If O
he O
relents," O
she O
said, O
amazed, O
"there O
is! O
Nothing O
is O
past O
hope, O
if O
such O
a O
miracle O
has O
happened." O
 O
"He O
is O
past O
relenting," O
said O
her O
husband. O
"He O
is O
dead." O
 O
She O
was O
a O
mild O
and O
patient O
creature O
if O
her O
face O
spoke O
truth; O
but O
she O
was O
thankful O
in O
her O
soul O
to O
hear O
it, O
and O
she O
said O
so, O
with O
clasped O
hands. O
She O
prayed O
forgiveness O
the O
next O
moment, O
and O
was O
sorry; O
but O
the O
first O
was O
the O
emotion O
of O
her O
heart. O
 O
"What O
the O
half-drunken O
woman O
whom O
I O
told O
you O
of O
last O
night, O
said O
to O
me, O
when O
I O
tried O
to O
see O
him O
and O
obtain O
a O
week's O
delay; O
and O
what O
I O
thought O
was O
a O
mere O
excuse O
to O
avoid O
me; O
turns O
out O
to O
have O
been O
quite O
true. O
He O
was O
not O
only O
very O
ill, O
but O
dying, O
then." O
 O
"To O
whom O
will O
our O
debt O
be O
transferred?" O
 O
"I O
don't O
know. O
But O
before O
that O
time O
we O
shall O
be O
ready O
with O
the O
money; O
and O
even O
though O
we O
were O
not, O
it O
would O
be O
bad O
fortune O
indeed O
to O
find O
so O
merciless O
a O
creditor O
in O
his O
successor. O
We O
may O
sleep O
to-night O
with O
light O
hearts, O
Caroline!" O
 O
Yes. O
Soften O
it O
as O
they O
would, O
their O
hearts O
were O
lighter. O
The O
children's O
faces O
hushed, O
and O
clustered O
round O
to O
hear O
what O
they O
so O
little O
understood, O
were O
brighter; O
and O
it O
was O
a O
happier O
house O
for O
this O
man's O
death! O
The O
only O
emotion O
that O
the O
Ghost O
could O
show O
him, O
caused O
by O
the O
event, O
was O
one O
of O
pleasure. O
 O
"Let O
me O
see O
some O
tenderness O
connected O
with O
a O
death," O
said O
Scrooge; O
"or O
that O
dark O
chamber, O
Spirit, O
which O
we O
left O
just O
now, O
will O
be O
for O
ever O
present O
to O
me." O
 O
The O
Ghost O
conducted O
him O
through O
several O
streets O
familiar O
to O
his O
feet; O
and O
as O
they O
went O
along, O
Scrooge O
looked O
here O
and O
there O
to O
find O
himself, O
but O
nowhere O
was O
he O
to O
be O
seen. O
They O
entered O
poor O
Bob O
Cratchit's O
house; O
the O
dwelling O
he O
had O
visited O
before; O
and O
found O
the O
mother O
and O
the O
children O
seated O
round O
the O
fire. O
 O
Quiet. O
Very O
quiet. O
The O
noisy O
little O
Cratchits O
were O
as O
still O
as O
statues O
in O
one O
corner, O
and O
sat O
looking O
up O
at O
Peter, O
who O
had O
a O
book O
before O
him. O
The O
mother O
and O
her O
daughters O
were O
engaged O
in O
sewing. O
But O
surely O
they O
were O
very O
quiet! O
 O
"'And O
He O
took O
a O
child, O
and O
set O
him O
in O
the O
midst O
of O
them.'" O
 O
Where O
had O
Scrooge O
heard O
those O
words? O
He O
had O
not O
dreamed O
them. O
The O
boy O
must O
have O
read O
them O
out, O
as O
he O
and O
the O
Spirit O
crossed O
the O
threshold. O
Why O
did O
he O
not O
go O
on? O
 O
The O
mother O
laid O
her O
work O
upon O
the O
table, O
and O
put O
her O
hand O
up O
to O
her O
face. O
 O
"The O
colour O
hurts O
my O
eyes," O
she O
said. O
 O
The O
colour? O
Ah, O
poor O
Tiny O
Tim! O
 O
"They're O
better O
now O
again," O
said O
Cratchit's O
wife. O
"It O
makes O
them O
weak O
by O
candle-light; O
and O
I O
wouldn't O
show O
weak O
eyes O
to O
your O
father O
when O
he O
comes O
home, O
for O
the O
world. O
It O
must O
be O
near O
his O
time." O
 O
"Past O
it O
rather," O
Peter O
answered, O
shutting O
up O
his O
book. O
"But O
I O
think O
he's O
walked O
a O
little O
slower O
than O
he O
used, O
these O
few O
last O
evenings, O
mother." O
 O
They O
were O
very O
quiet O
again. O
At O
last O
she O
said, O
and O
in O
a O
steady O
cheerful O
voice, O
that O
only O
faultered O
once: O
 O
"I O
have O
known O
him O
walk O
with—I O
have O
known O
him O
walk O
with O
Tiny O
Tim O
upon O
his O
shoulder, O
very O
fast O
indeed." O
 O
"And O
so O
have O
I," O
cried O
Peter. O
"Often." O
 O
"And O
so O
have O
I!" O
exclaimed O
another. O
So O
had O
all. O
 O
"But O
he O
was O
very O
light O
to O
carry," O
she O
resumed, O
intent O
upon O
her O
work, O
"and O
his O
father O
loved O
him O
so, O
that O
it O
was O
no O
trouble—no O
trouble. O
And O
there O
is O
your O
father O
at O
the O
door!" O
 O
She O
hurried O
out O
to O
meet O
him; O
and O
little O
Bob O
in O
his O
comforter—he O
had O
need O
of O
it, O
poor O
fellow—came O
in. O
His O
tea O
was O
ready O
for O
him O
on O
the O
hob, O
and O
they O
all O
tried O
who O
should O
help O
him O
to O
it O
most. O
Then O
the O
two O
young O
Cratchits O
got O
upon O
his O
knees O
and O
laid, O
each O
child O
a O
little O
cheek, O
against O
his O
face, O
as O
if O
they O
said, O
"Don't O
mind O
it, O
father. O
Don't O
be O
grieved!" O
 O
Bob O
was O
very O
cheerful O
with O
them, O
and O
spoke O
pleasantly O
to O
all O
the O
family. O
He O
looked O
at O
the O
work O
upon O
the O
table, O
and O
praised O
the O
industry O
and O
speed O
of O
Mrs. O
Cratchit O
and O
the O
girls. O
They O
would O
be O
done O
long O
before O
Sunday O
he O
said. O
 O
"Sunday! O
You O
went O
to-day O
then, O
Robert?" O
said O
his O
wife. O
 O
"Yes, O
my O
dear," O
returned O
Bob. O
"I O
wish O
you O
could O
have O
gone. O
It O
would O
have O
done O
you O
good O
to O
see O
how O
green O
a O
place O
it O
is. O
But O
you'll O
see O
it O
often. O
I O
promised O
him O
that O
I O
would O
walk O
there O
on O
a O
Sunday. O
My O
little, O
little O
child!" O
cried O
Bob. O
"My O
little O
child!" O
 O
He O
broke O
down O
all O
at O
once. O
He O
couldn't O
help O
it. O
If O
he O
could O
have O
helped O
it, O
he O
and O
his O
child O
would O
have O
been O
farther O
apart O
perhaps O
than O
they O
were. O
 O
He O
left O
the O
room, O
and O
went O
up O
stairs O
into O
the O
room O
above, O
which O
was O
lighted O
cheerfully, O
and O
hung O
with O
Christmas. O
There O
was O
a O
chair O
set O
close O
beside O
the O
child, O
and O
there O
were O
signs O
of O
some O
one O
having O
been O
there, O
lately. O
Poor O
Bob O
sat O
down O
in O
it, O
and O
when O
he O
had O
thought O
a O
little O
and O
composed O
himself, O
he O
kissed O
the O
little O
face. O
He O
was O
reconciled O
to O
what O
had O
happened, O
and O
went O
down O
again O
quite O
happy. O
 O
They O
drew O
about O
the O
fire, O
and O
talked; O
the O
girls O
and O
mother O
working O
still. O
Bob O
told O
them O
of O
the O
extraordinary O
kindness O
of O
Mr. O
Scrooge's O
nephew, O
whom O
he O
had O
scarcely O
seen O
but O
once, O
and O
who, O
meeting O
him O
in O
the O
street O
that O
day, O
and O
seeing O
that O
he O
looked O
a O
little—"just O
a O
little O
down O
you O
know" O
said O
Bob, O
enquired O
what O
had O
happened O
to O
distress O
him. O
"On O
which," O
said O
Bob, O
"for O
he O
is O
the O
pleasantest-spoken O
gentleman O
you O
ever O
heard, O
I O
told O
him. O
'I O
am O
heartily O
sorry O
for O
it, O
Mr. O
Cratchit, O
he O
said, O
'and O
heartily O
sorry O
for O
your O
good O
wife.' O
By O
the O
bye, O
how O
he O
ever O
knew O
that, O
I O
don't O
know." O
 O
"Knew O
what, O
my O
dear?" O
 O
"Why, O
that O
you O
were O
a O
good O
wife," O
replied O
Bob. O
 O
"Everybody O
knows O
that!" O
said O
Peter. O
 O
"Very O
well O
observed, O
my O
boy!" O
cried O
Bob. O
"I O
hope O
they O
do. O
'Heartily O
sorry,' O
he O
said. O
'for O
your O
good O
wife. O
If O
I O
can O
be O
of O
service O
in O
you O
in O
any O
way,' O
he O
said, O
giving O
me O
his O
card, O
'that's O
where O
I O
live. O
Pray O
come O
to O
me.' O
Now, O
it O
wasn't," O
cried O
Bob, O
"for O
the O
sake O
of O
anything O
he O
might O
be O
able O
to O
do O
for O
us, O
so O
much O
as O
for O
his O
kind O
way, O
that O
this O
was O
quite O
delightful. O
It O
really O
seemed O
as O
if O
he O
had O
known O
our O
Tiny O
Tim, O
and O
felt O
with O
us." O
 O
"I'm O
sure O
he's O
a O
good O
soul!" O
said O
Mrs. O
Cratchit. O
 O
"You O
would O
be O
surer O
of O
it, O
my O
dear," O
returned O
Bob, O
"if O
you O
saw O
and O
spoke O
to O
him. O
I O
shouldn't O
be O
at O
all O
surprised, O
mark O
what O
I O
say, O
if O
he O
got O
Peter O
a O
better O
situation." O
 O
"Only O
hear O
that, O
Peter," O
said O
Mrs. O
Cratchit. O
 O
"And O
then," O
cried O
one O
of O
the O
girls, O
"Peter O
will O
be O
keeping O
company O
with O
some O
one, O
and O
setting O
up O
for O
himself." O
 O
"Get O
along O
with O
you!" O
retorted O
Peter, O
grinning. O
 O
"It's O
just O
as O
likely O
as O
not." O
said O
Bob, O
"one O
of O
these O
days; O
though O
there's O
plenty O
of O
time O
for O
that, O
my O
dear. O
But O
however O
and O
whenever O
we O
part O
from O
one O
another, O
I O
am O
sure O
we O
shall O
none O
of O
us O
forget O
poor O
Tiny O
Tim—shall O
we—or O
this O
first O
parting O
that O
there O
was O
among O
us?" O
 O
"Never, O
father!" O
cried O
they O
all. O
 O
"And O
I O
know," O
said O
Bob, O
"I O
know, O
my O
dears, O
that O
when O
we O
recollect O
how O
patient O
and O
how O
mild O
he O
was; O
although O
he O
was O
a O
little, O
little O
child; O
we O
shall O
not O
quarrel O
easily O
among O
ourselves, O
and O
forget O
poor O
Tiny O
Tim O
in O
doing O
it." O
 O
"No, O
never, O
father!" O
they O
all O
cried O
again. O
 O
"I O
am O
very O
happy," O
said O
little O
Bob, O
"I O
am O
very O
happy!" O
 O
Mrs. O
Cratchit O
kissed O
him, O
his O
daughters O
kissed O
him, O
the O
two O
young O
Cratchits O
kissed O
him, O
and O
Peter O
and O
himself O
shook O
hands. O
Spirit O
of O
Tiny O
Tim, O
thy O
childish O
essence O
was O
from O
God! O
 O
"Spectre," O
said O
Scrooge, O
"something O
informs O
me O
that O
our O
parting O
moment O
is O
at O
hand. O
I O
know O
it, O
but O
I O
know O
not O
how. O
Tell O
me O
what O
man O
that O
was O
whom O
we O
saw O
lying O
dead?" O
 O
The O
Ghost O
of O
Christmas O
Yet O
To O
Come O
conveyed O
him, O
as O
before—though O
at O
a O
different O
time, O
he O
thought: O
indeed, O
there O
seemed O
no O
order O
in O
these O
latter O
visions, O
save O
that O
they O
were O
in O
the O
Future—into O
the O
resorts O
of O
business O
men, O
but O
showed O
him O
not O
himself. O
Indeed, O
the O
Spirit O
did O
not O
stay O
for O
anything, O
but O
went O
straight O
on, O
as O
to O
the O
end O
just O
now O
desired, O
until O
besought O
by O
Scrooge O
to O
tarry O
for O
a O
moment. O
 O
"This O
court," O
said O
Scrooge, O
"through O
which O
we O
hurry O
now, O
is O
where O
my O
place O
of O
occupation O
is, O
and O
has O
been O
for O
a O
length O
of O
time. O
I O
see O
the O
house. O
Let O
me O
behold O
what O
I O
shall O
be, O
in O
days O
to O
come." O
 O
The O
Spirit O
stopped; O
the O
hand O
was O
pointed O
elsewhere. O
 O
"The O
house O
is O
yonder," O
Scrooge O
exclaimed. O
"Why O
do O
you O
point O
away?" O
 O
The O
inexorable O
finger O
underwent O
no O
change. O
 O
Scrooge O
hastened O
to O
the O
window O
of O
his O
office, O
and O
looked O
in. O
It O
was O
an O
office O
still, O
but O
not O
his. O
The O
furniture O
was O
not O
the O
same, O
and O
the O
figure O
in O
the O
chair O
was O
not O
himself. O
The O
Phantom O
pointed O
as O
before. O
 O
He O
joined O
it O
once O
again, O
and O
wondering O
why O
and O
whither O
he O
had O
gone, O
accompanied O
it O
until O
they O
reached O
an O
iron O
gate. O
He O
paused O
to O
look O
round O
before O
entering. O
 O
A O
churchyard. O
Here, O
then, O
the O
wretched O
man O
whose O
name O
he O
had O
now O
to O
learn, O
lay O
underneath O
the O
ground. O
It O
was O
a O
worthy O
place. O
Walled O
in O
by O
houses; O
overrun O
by O
grass O
and O
weeds, O
the O
growth O
of O
vegetation's O
death, O
not O
life; O
choked O
up O
with O
too O
much O
burying; O
fat O
with O
repleted O
appetite. O
A O
worthy O
place! O
 O
The O
Spirit O
stood O
among O
the O
graves, O
and O
pointed O
down O
to O
One. O
He O
advanced O
towards O
it O
trembling. O
The O
Phantom O
was O
exactly O
as O
it O
had O
been, O
but O
he O
dreaded O
that O
he O
saw O
new O
meaning O
in O
its O
solemn O
shape. O
 O
"Before O
I O
draw O
nearer O
to O
that O
stone O
to O
which O
you O
point," O
said O
Scrooge, O
"answer O
me O
one O
question. O
Are O
these O
the O
shadows O
of O
the O
things O
that O
Will O
be, O
or O
are O
they O
shadows O
of O
the O
things O
that O
May O
be, O
only?" O
 O
Still O
the O
Ghost O
pointed O
downward O
to O
the O
grave O
by O
which O
it O
stood. O
 O
"Men's O
courses O
will O
foreshadow O
certain O
ends, O
to O
which, O
if O
persevered O
in, O
they O
must O
lead," O
said O
Scrooge. O
"But O
if O
the O
courses O
be O
departed O
from, O
the O
ends O
will O
change. O
Say O
it O
is O
thus O
with O
what O
you O
show O
me!" O
 O
The O
Spirit O
was O
immovable O
as O
ever. O
 O
Scrooge O
crept O
towards O
it, O
trembling O
as O
he O
went; O
and O
following O
the O
finger, O
read O
upon O
the O
stone O
of O
the O
neglected O
grave O
his O
own O
name, O
Ebenezer O
Scrooge. O
 O
"Am O
I O
that O
man O
who O
lay O
upon O
the O
bed?" O
he O
cried, O
upon O
his O
knees. O
 O
The O
finger O
pointed O
from O
the O
grave O
to O
him, O
and O
back O
again. O
 O
"No, O
Spirit! O
Oh O
no, O
no!" O
 O
The O
finger O
still O
was O
there. O
 O
"Spirit!" O
he O
cried, O
tight O
clutching O
at O
its O
robe, O
"hear O
me! O
I O
am O
not O
the O
man O
I O
was. O
I O
will O
not O
be O
the O
man O
I O
must O
have O
been O
but O
for O
this O
intercourse. O
Why O
show O
me O
this, O
if O
I O
am O
past O
all O
hope?" O
 O
For O
the O
first O
time O
the O
hand O
appeared O
to O
shake. O
 O
"Good O
Spirit," O
he O
pursued, O
as O
down O
upon O
the O
ground O
he O
fell O
before O
it: O
"Your O
nature O
intercedes O
for O
me, O
and O
pities O
me. O
Assure O
me O
that O
I O
yet O
may O
change O
these O
shadows O
you O
have O
shown O
me, O
by O
an O
altered O
life!" O
The O
kind O
hand O
trembled. O
 O
"I O
will O
honour O
Christmas O
in O
my O
heart, O
and O
try O
to O
keep O
it O
all O
the O
year. O
I O
will O
live O
in O
the O
Past, O
the O
Present, O
and O
the O
Future. O
The O
Spirits O
of O
all O
Three O
shall O
strive O
within O
me. O
I O
will O
not O
shut O
out O
the O
lessons O
that O
they O
teach. O
Oh, O
tell O
me O
I O
may O
sponge O
away O
the O
writing O
on O
this O
stone!" O
 O
In O
his O
agony, O
he O
caught O
the O
spectral O
hand. O
It O
sought O
to O
free O
itself, O
but O
he O
was O
strong O
in O
his O
entreaty, O
and O
detained O
it. O
The O
Spirit, O
stronger O
yet, O
repulsed O
him. O
 O
Holding O
up O
his O
hands O
in O
one O
last O
prayer O
to O
have O
his O
fate O
reversed, O
he O
saw O
an O
alteration O
in O
the O
Phantom's O
hood O
and O
dress. O
It O
shrunk, O
collapsed, O
and O
dwindled O
down O
into O
a O
bedpost.j O

Yes! O
and O
the O
bedpost O
was O
his O
own. O
The O
bed O
was O
his O
own, O
the O
room O
was O
his O
own. O
Best O
and O
happiest O
of O
all, O
the O
Time O
before O
him O
was O
his O
own, O
to O
make O
amends O
in! O
 O
"I O
will O
live O
in O
the O
Past, O
the O
Present, O
and O
the O

Scrooge O
repeated, O
as O
he O
scrambled O
out O
of O
bed. O
"The O
Spirits O
of O
all O
Three O
shall O
strive O
within O

Oh O
Jacob O
Marley! O
Heaven, O
and O
the O
Christmas O

be O
praised O
for O
this! O
I O
say O
it O
on O
my O
knees, O
old O
Jacob; O
on O
my O
knees!" O
 O
He O
was O
so O
fluttered O
and O
so O
glowing O
with O
his O
good O
intentions, O
that O
his O
broken O
voice O
would O
scarcely O
answer O
to O
his O
call. O
He O
had O
been O
sobbing O
violently O
in O
his O
conflict O
with O
the O
Spirit, O
and O
his O
face O
was O
wet O
with O
tears. O
 O
"They O
are O
not O
torn O
down," O
cried O
Scrooge, O
folding O
one O
of O
his O
bed-curtains O
in O
his O
arms, O
"they O
are O
not O
torn O
down, O
rings O
and O
all. O
They O
are O
here: O
I O
am O
here: O
the O
shadows O
of O
the O
things O
that O
would O
have O
been, O
may O
be O
dispelled. O
They O
will O
be. O
I O
know O
they O
will!" O
 O
His O
hands O
were O
busy O
with O
his O
garments O
all O
this O
time: O
turning O
them O
inside O
out, O
putting O
them O
on O
upside O
down, O
tearing O
them, O
mislaying O
them, O
making O
them O
parties O
to O
every O
kind O
of O
extravagance. O
 O
"I O
don't O
know O
what O
to O
do!" O
cried O
Scrooge, O
laughing O
and O
crying O
in O
the O
same O
breath; O
and O
making O
a O
perfect O
Laocoön O
of O
himself O
with O
his O
stockings. O
"I O
am O
as O
light O
as O
a O
feather, O
I O
am O
as O
happy O
as O
an O
angel, O
I O
am O
as O
merry O
as O
a O
school-boy. O
I O
am O
as O
giddy O
as O
a O
drunken O
man. O
A O
merry O
Christmas O
to O
everybody! O
A O
happy O
New O
Year O
to O
all O
the O
world. O
Hallo O
here! O
Whoop! O
Hallo!" O
 O
He O
had O
frisked O
into O
the O
sitting-room, O
and O
was O
now O
standing O
there: O
perfectly O
winded. O
 O
"There's O
the O
saucepan O
that O
the O
gruel O
was O
in!" O
cried O
Scrooge, O
starting O
off O
again, O
and O
going O
round O
the O
fire-place. O
"There's O
the O
door, O
by O
which O
the O
Ghost O
of O
Jacob O
Marley O
entered! O
There's O
the O
corner O
where O
the O
Ghost O
of O
Christmas O
Present O
sat! O
There's O
the O
window O
where O
I O
saw O
the O
wandering O
Spirits! O
It's O
all O
right, O
it's O
all O
true, O
it O
all O
happened. O
Ha O
ha O
ha!" O
 O
Really, O
for O
a O
man O
who O
had O
been O
out O
of O
practice O
for O
so O
many O
years, O
it O
was O
a O
splendid O
laugh, O
a O
most O
illustrious O
laugh. O
The O
father O
of O
a O
long, O
long, O
line O
of O
brilliant O
laughs! O
 O
"I O
don't O
know O
what O
day O
of O
the O
month O
it O
is!" O
said O
Scrooge. O
"I O
don't O
know O
how O
long O
I've O
been O
among O
the O
Spirits. O
I O
don't O
know O
anything. O
I'm O
quite O
a O
baby. O
Never O
mind. O
I O
don't O
care. O
I'd O
rather O
be O
a O
baby. O
Hallo! O
Whoop! O
Hallo O
here!" O
 O
He O
was O
checked O
in O
his O
transports O
by O
the O
churches O
ringing O
out O
the O
lustiest O
peals O
he O
had O
ever O
heard. O
Clash, O
clang, O
hammer, O
ding, O
dong, O
bell. O
Bell, O
dong, O
ding, O
hammer, O
clang, O
clash! O
Oh, O
glorious, O
glorious! O
 O
Running O
to O
the O
window, O
he O
opened O
it, O
and O
put O
out O
his O
head. O
No O
fog, O
no O
mist; O
clear, O
bright, O
jovial, O
stirring, O
cold; O
cold, O
piping O
for O
the O
blood O
to O
dance O
to; O
Golden O
sunlight; O
Heavenly O
sky; O
sweet O
fresh O
air; O
merry O
bells. O
Oh, O
glorious. O
Glorious! O
 O
"What's O
to-day?" O
cried O
Scrooge, O
calling O
downward O
to O
a O
boy O
in O
Sunday O
clothes, O
who O
perhaps O
had O
loitered O
in O
to O
look O
about O
him. O
 O
"Eh?" O
returned O
the O
boy, O
with O
all O
his O
might O
of O
wonder. O
 O
"What's O
to-day, O
my O
fine O
fellow?" O
said O
Scrooge. O
 O
"To-day!" O
replied O
the O
boy. O
"Why, O
Christmas O
Day." O
 O
"It's O
Christmas O
Day!" O
said O
Scrooge O
to O
himself. O
"I O
haven't O
missed O
it. O
The O
Spirits O
have O
done O
it O
all O
in O
one O
night. O
They O
can O
do O
anything O
they O
like. O
Of O
course O
they O
can. O
Of O
course O
they O
can. O
Hallo, O
my O
fine O
fellow!" O
 O
"Hallo!" O
returned O
the O
boy. O
 O
"Do O
you O
know O
the O
Poulterer's, O
in O
the O
next O
street O
but O
one, O
at O
the O
corner?" O
Scrooge O
inquired. O
 O
"I O
should O
hope O
I O
did," O
replied O
the O
lad. O
 O
"An O
intelligent O
boy!" O
said O
Scrooge. O
"A O
remarkable O
boy! O
Do O
you O
know O
whether O
they've O
sold O
the O
prize O
Turkey O
that O
was O
hanging O
up O
there? O
Not O
the O
little O
prize O
Turkey: O
the O
big O
one?" O
 O
"What, O
the O
one O
as O
big O
as O
me?" O
returned O
the O
boy. O
 O
"What O
a O
delightful O
boy!" O
said O
Scrooge. O
"It's O
a O
pleasure O
to O
talk O
to O
him. O
Yes, O
my O
buck!" O
 O
"It's O
hanging O
there O
now," O
replied O
the O
boy. O
 O
"Is O
it?" O
said O
Scrooge. O
"Go O
and O
buy O
it." O
 O
"Walk-er!" O
exclaimed O
the O
boy. O
 O
"No, O
no," O
said O
Scrooge, O
"I O
am O
in O
earnest. O
Go O
and O
buy O
it, O
and O
tell O
'em O
to O
bring O
it O
here, O
that O
I O
may O
give O
them O
the O
direction O
where O
to O
take O
it. O
Come O
back O
with O
the O
man, O
and O
I'll O
give O
you O
a O
shilling. O
Come O
back O
with O
him O
in O
less O
than O
five O
minutes, O
and O
I'll O
give O
you O
half-a-crown!" O
 O
The O
boy O
was O
off O
like O
a O
shot. O
He O
must O
have O
had O
a O
steady O
hand O
at O
a O
trigger O
who O
could O
have O
got O
a O
shot O
off O
half O
so O
fast. O
 O
"I'll O
send O
it O
to O
Bob O
Cratchit's!" O
whispered O
Scrooge, O
rubbing O
his O
hands, O
and O
splitting O
with O
a O
laugh. O
"He O
sha'n't O
know O
who O
sends O
it. O
It's O
twice O
the O
size O
of O
Tiny O
Tim. O
Joe O
Miller O
never O
made O
such O
a O
joke O
as O
sending O
it O
to O
Bob's O
will O
be!" O
 O
The O
hand O
in O
which O
he O
wrote O
the O
address O
was O
not O
a O
steady O
one, O
but O
write O
it O
he O
did, O
somehow, O
and O
went O
down O
stairs O
to O
open O
the O
street O
door, O
ready O
for O
the O
coming O
of O
the O
poulterer's O
man. O
As O
he O
stood O
there, O
waiting O
his O
arrival, O
the O
knocker O
caught O
his O
eye. O
 O
"I O
shall O
love O
it, O
as O
long O
as O
I O
live!" O
cried O
Scrooge, O
patting O
it O
with O
his O
hand. O
"I O
scarcely O
ever O
looked O
at O
it O
before. O
What O
an O
honest O
expression O
it O
has O
in O
its O
face! O
It's O
a O
wonderful O
knocker!—Here's O
the O
Turkey. O
Hallo! O
Whoop! O
How O
are O
you! O
Merry O
Christmas!" O
 O
It O
was O
a O
Turkey! O
He O
never O
could O
have O
stood O
upon O
his O
legs, O
that O
bird. O
He O
would O
have O
snapped O
'em O
short O
off O
in O
a O
minute, O
like O
sticks O
of O
sealing-wax. O
 O
"Why, O
it's O
impossible O
to O
carry O
that O
to O
Camden O
Town," O
said O
Scrooge. O
"You O
must O
have O
a O
cab." O
 O
The O
chuckle O
with O
which O
he O
said O
this, O
and O
the O
chuckle O
with O
which O
he O
paid O
for O
the O
Turkey, O
and O
the O
chuckle O
with O
which O
he O
paid O
for O
the O
cab, O
and O
the O
chuckle O
with O
which O
he O
recompensed O
the O
boy, O
were O
only O
to O
be O
exceeded O
by O
the O
chuckle O
with O
which O
he O
sat O
down O
breathless O
in O
his O
chair O
again, O
and O
chuckled O
till O
he O
cried. O
 O
Shaving O
was O
not O
an O
easy O
task, O
for O
his O
hand O
continued O
to O
shake O
very O
much; O
and O
shaving O
requires O
attention, O
even O
when O
you O
don't O
dance O
while O
you O
are O
at O
it. O
But O
if O
he O
had O
cut O
the O
end O
of O
his O
nose O
off, O
he O
would O
have O
put O
a O
piece O
of O
sticking-plaister O
over O
it, O
and O
been O
quite O
satisfied. O
 O
He O
dressed O
himself O
"all O
in O
his O
best," O
and O
at O
last O
got O
out O
into O
the O
streets. O
The O
people O
were O
by O
this O
time O
pouring O
forth, O
as O
he O
had O
seen O
them O
with O
the O
Ghost O
of O
Christmas O
Present; O
and O
walking O
with O
his O
hands O
behind O
him, O
Scrooge O
regarded O
every O
one O
with O
a O
delighted O
smile. O
He O
looked O
so O
irresistibly O
pleasant, O
in O
a O
word, O
that O
three O
or O
four O
good-humoured O
fellows O
said, O
"Good O
morning, O
sir! O
A O
merry O
Christmas O
to O
you!" O
And O
Scrooge O
said O
often O
afterward, O
that O
of O
all O
the O
blithe O
sounds O
he O
had O
ever O
heard, O
those O
were O
the O
blithest O
in O
his O
ears. O
 O
He O
had O
not O
gone O
far, O
when O
coming O
on O
towards O
him O
he O
beheld O
the O
portly O
gentleman, O
who O
had O
walked O
into O
his O
counting-house O
the O
day O
before O
and O
said, O
"Scrooge O
and O
Marley's, O
I O
believe?" O
It O
sent O
a O
pang O
across O
his O
heart O
to O
think O
how O
this O
old O
gentleman O
would O
look O
upon O
him O
when O
they O
met; O
but O
he O
knew O
what O
path O
lay O
straight O
before O
him, O
and O
he O
took O
it. O
 O
"My O
dear O
sir," O
said O
Scrooge, O
quickening O
his O
pace, O
and O
taking O
the O
old O
gentleman O
by O
both O
his O
hands. O
"How O
do O
you O
do? O
I O
hope O
you O
succeeded O
yesterday. O
It O
was O
very O
kind O
of O
you. O
A O
merry O
Christmas O
to O
you, O
sir!" O
 O
"Mr. O
Scrooge?" O
 O
"Yes," O
said O
Scrooge. O
"That O
is O
my O
name, O
and O
I O
fear O
it O
may O
not O
be O
pleasant O
to O
you. O
Allow O
me O
to O
ask O
your O
pardon. O
And O
will O
you O
have O
the O
goodness"—here O
Scrooge O
whispered O
in O
his O
ear. O
 O
"Lord O
bless O
me!" O
cried O
the O
gentleman, O
as O
if O
his O
breath O
were O
gone, O
"My O
dear O
Mr. O
Scrooge, O
are O
you O
serious?" O
 O
"If O
you O
please," O
said O
Scrooge. O
"Not O
a O
farthing O
less. O
A O
great O
many O
back-payments O
are O
included O
in O
it, O
I O
assure O
you. O
Will O
you O
do O
me O
that O
favour?" O
 O
"My O
dear O
sir," O
said O
the O
other, O
shaking O
hands O
with O
him. O
"I O
don't O
know O
what O
to O
say O
to O
such O
munifi—" O
 O
"Don't O
say O
anything, O
please," O
retorted O
Scrooge. O
"Come O
and O
see O
me. O
Will O
you O
come O
and O
see O
me?" O
 O
"I O
will!" O
cried O
the O
old O
gentleman. O
And O
it O
was O
clear O
he O
meant O
to O
do O
it. O
 O
"Thank'ee," O
said O
Scrooge. O
"I O
am O
much O
obliged O
to O
you. O
I O
thank O
you O
fifty O
times. O
Bless O
you!" O
 O
He O
went O
to O
church, O
and O
walked O
about O
the O
streets, O
and O
watched O
the O
people O
hurrying O
to O
and O
fro, O
and O
patted O
children O
on O
the O
head, O
and O
questioned O
beggars, O
and O
looked O
down O
into O
the O
kitchens O
of O
houses, O
and O
up O
to O
the O
windows; O
and O
found O
that O
everything O
could O
yield O
him O
pleasure. O
He O
had O
never O
dreamed O
that O
any O
walk—that O
anything—could O
give O
him O
so O
much O
happiness. O
In O
the O
afternoon, O
he O
turned O
his O
steps O
towards O
his O
nephew's O
house. O
 O
He O
passed O
the O
door O
a O
dozen O
times, O
before O
he O
had O
the O
courage O
to O
go O
up O
and O
knock. O
But O
he O
made O
a O
dash, O
and O
did O
it: O
 O
"Is O
your O
master O
at O
home, O
my O
dear?" O
said O
Scrooge O
to O
the O
girl. O
Nice O
girl! O
Very. O
 O
"Yes, O
sir." O
 O
"Where O
is O
he, O
my O
love?" O
said O
Scrooge. O
 O
"He's O
in O
the O
dining-room, O
sir, O
along O
with O
mistress. O
I'll O
show O
you O
up O
stairs, O
if O
you O
please." O
 O
"Thank'ee. O
He O
knows O
me," O
said O
Scrooge, O
with O
his O
hand O
already O
on O
the O
dining-room O
lock. O
"I'll O
go O
in O
here, O
my O
dear." O
 O
He O
turned O
it O
gently, O
and O
sidled O
his O
face O
in, O
round O
the O
door. O
They O
were O
looking O
at O
the O
table O
(which O
was O
spread O
out O
in O
great O
array); O
for O
these O
young O
housekeepers O
are O
always O
nervous O
on O
such O
points, O
and O
like O
to O
see O
that O
everything O
is O
right. O
 O
"Fred!" O
said O
Scrooge. O
 O
Dear O
heart O
alive, O
how O
his O
niece O
by O
marriage O
started! O
Scrooge O
had O
forgotten, O
for O
the O
moment, O
about O
her O
sitting O
in O
the O
corner O
with O
the O
footstool, O
or O
he O
wouldn't O
have O
done O
it, O
on O
any O
account. O
 O
"Why O
bless O
my O
soul!" O
cried O
Fred, O
"who's O
that?" O
 O
"It's O
I. O
Your O
uncle O
Scrooge. O
I O
have O
come O
to O
dinner. O
Will O
you O
let O
me O
in, O
Fred?" O
 O
Let O
him O
in! O
It O
is O
a O
mercy O
he O
didn't O
shake O
his O
arm O
off. O
He O
was O
at O
home O
in O
five O
minutes. O
Nothing O
could O
be O
heartier. O
His O
niece O
looked O
just O
the O
same. O
So O
did O
Topper O
when O
he O
came. O
So O
did O
the O
plump O
sister, O
when O
she O
came. O
So O
did O
every O
one O
when O
they O
came. O
Wonderful O
party, O
wonderful O
games, O
wonderful O
unanimity, O
won-der-ful O
happiness! O
 O
But O
he O
was O
early O
at O
the O
office O
next O
morning. O
Oh O
he O
was O
early O
there. O
If O
he O
could O
only O
be O
there O
first, O
and O
catch O
Bob O
Cratchit O
coming O
late! O
That O
was O
the O
thing O
he O
had O
set O
his O
heart O
upon. O
 O
And O
he O
did O
it; O
yes O
he O
did! O
The O
clock O
struck O
nine. O
No O
Bob. O
A O
quarter O
past. O
No O
Bob. O
He O
was O
full O
eighteen O
minutes O
and O
a O
half, O
behind O
his O
time. O
Scrooge O
sat O
with O
his O
door O
wide O
open, O
that O
he O
might O
see O
him O
come O
into O
the O
Tank. O
 O
His O
hat O
was O
off, O
before O
he O
opened O
the O
door; O
his O
comforter O
too. O
He O
was O
on O
his O
stool O
in O
a O
jiffy; O
driving O
away O
with O
his O
pen, O
as O
if O
he O
were O
trying O
to O
overtake O
nine O
o'clock. O
 O
"Hallo!" O
growled O
Scrooge, O
in O
his O
accustomed O
voice O
as O
near O
as O
he O
could O
feign O
it. O
"What O
do O
you O
mean O
by O
coming O
here O
at O
this O
time O
of O
day?" O
 O
"I'm O
very O
sorry, O
sir," O
said O
Bob. O
"I O
am O
behind O
my O
time." O
 O
"You O
are?" O
repeated O
Scrooge. O
"Yes. O
I O
think O
you O
are. O
Step O
this O
way, O
if O
you O
please." O
 O
"It's O
only O
once O
a O
year, O
sir," O
pleaded O
Bob, O
appearing O
from O
the O
Tank. O
"It O
shall O
not O
be O
repeated. O
I O
was O
making O
rather O
merry O
yesterday, O
sir." O
 O
"Now, O
I'll O
tell O
you O
what, O
my O
friend," O
said O
Scrooge, O
"I O
am O
not O
going O
to O
stand O
this O
sort O
of O
thing O
any O
longer. O
And O
therefore," O
he O
continued, O
leaping O
from O
his O
stool, O
and O
giving O
Bob O
such O
a O
dig O
in O
the O
waistcoat O
that O
he O
staggered O
back O
into O
the O
Tank O
again: O
"and O
therefore O
I O
am O
about O
to O
raise O
your O
salary!" O
 O
Bob O
trembled, O
and O
got O
a O
little O
nearer O
to O
the O
ruler. O
He O
had O
a O
momentary O
idea O
of O
knocking O
Scrooge O
down O
with O
it; O
holding O
him; O
and O
calling O
to O
the O
people O
in O
the O
court O
for O
help O
and O
a O
strait-waistcoat. O
 O
"A O
merry O
Christmas, O
Bob!" O
said O
Scrooge, O
with O
an O
earnestness O
that O
could O
not O
be O
mistaken, O
as O
he O
clapped O
him O
on O
the O
back. O
"A O
merrier O
Christmas, O
Bob, O
my O
good O
fellow, O
than O
I O
have O
given O
you, O
for O
many O
a O
year! O
I'll O
raise O
your O
salary, O
and O
endeavour O
to O
assist O
your O
struggling O
family, O
and O
we O
will O
discuss O
your O
affairs O
this O
very O
afternoon, O
over O
a O
Christmas O
bowl O
of O
smoking O
bishop, O
Bob! O
 O
Make O
up O
the O
fires, O
and O
buy O
another O
coal-scuttle O
before O
you O
dot O
another O
i, O
Bob O
Cratchit!" O
 O
Scrooge O
was O
better O
than O
his O
word. O
He O
did O
it O
all, O
and O
infinitely O
more; O
and O
to O
Tiny O
Tim, O
who O
did O
not O
die, O
he O
was O
a O
second O
father. O
He O
became O
as O
good O
a O
friend, O
as O
good O
a O
master, O
and O
as O
good O
a O
man, O
as O
the O
good O
old O
city O
knew, O
or O
any O
other O
good O
old O
city, O
town, O
or O
borough, O
in O
the O
good O
old O
world. O
Some O
people O
laughed O
to O
see O
the O
alteration O
in O
him, O
but O
he O
let O
them O
laugh, O
and O
little O
heeded O
them; O
for O
he O
was O
wise O
enough O
to O
know O
that O
nothing O
ever O
happened O
on O
this O
globe, O
for O
good, O
at O
which O
some O
people O
did O
not O
have O
their O
fill O
of O
laughter O
in O
the O
outset; O
and O
knowing O
that O
such O
as O
these O
would O
be O
blind O
anyway, O
he O
thought O
it O
quite O
as O
well O
that O
they O
should O
wrinkle O
up O
their O
eyes O
in O
grins, O
as O
have O
the O
malady O
in O
less O
attractive O
forms. O
His O
own O
heart O
laughed: O
and O
that O
was O
quite O
enough O
for O
him. O
 O
He O
had O
no O
further O
intercourse O
with O
Spirits, O
but O
lived O
upon O
the O
Total O
Abstinence O
Principle, O
ever O
afterwards; O
and O
it O
was O
always O
said O
of O
him, O
that O
he O
knew O
how O
to O
keep O
Christmas O
well, O
if O
any O
man O
alive O
possessed O
the O
knowledge. O
May O
that O
be O
truly O
said O
of O
us, O
and O
all O
of O
us! O
And O
so, O
as O
Tiny O
Tim O
observed, O
God O
Bless O
Us, O
Every O
One! O
 O

 O
We O
were O
seated O
at O
breakfast O
one O
morning, O
my O
wife O
and O
I, O
when O
the O
maid O
brought O
in O
a O
telegram. O
It O
was O
from O
Sherlock O
Holmes O
and O
ran O
in O
this O
way: O
"Have O
you O
a O
couple O
of O
days O
to O
spare? O
Have O
just O
been O
wired O
for O
from O
the O
west O
of O
England O
in O
connection O
with O
Boscombe O
Valley O
tragedy. O
Shall O
be O
glad O
if O
you O
will O
come O
with O
me. O
Air O
and O
scenery O
perfect. O
Leave O
Paddington O
by O
the O
11:15." O
"What Quotation
do Quotation
you Quotation
say, Quotation
dear?" Quotation
said Cue
my Entity
wife, Entity
looking O
across O
at O
me. Entity
"Will Quotation
you Quotation
go?" Quotation
"I Quotation
really Quotation
don't Quotation
know Quotation
what Quotation
to Quotation
say. Quotation
I Quotation
have Quotation
a Quotation
fairly Quotation
long Quotation
list Quotation
at Quotation
present." Quotation
"Oh, Quotation
Anstruther Quotation
would Quotation
do Quotation
your Quotation
work Quotation
for Quotation
you. Quotation
You Quotation
have Quotation
been Quotation
looking Quotation
a Quotation
little Quotation
pale Quotation
lately. Quotation
I Quotation
think Quotation
that Quotation
the Quotation
change Quotation
would Quotation
do Quotation
you Quotation
good, Quotation
and Quotation
you Quotation
are Quotation
always Quotation
so Quotation
interested Quotation
in Quotation
Mr. Quotation
Sherlock Quotation
Holmes' Quotation
cases." Quotation
"I Quotation
should Quotation
be Quotation
ungrateful Quotation
if Quotation
I Quotation
were Quotation
not, Quotation
seeing Quotation
what Quotation
I Quotation
gained Quotation
through Quotation
one Quotation
of Quotation
them," Quotation
I Entity
answered. Cue
"But Quotation
if Quotation
I Quotation
am Quotation
to Quotation
go, Quotation
I Quotation
must Quotation
pack Quotation
at Quotation
once, Quotation
for Quotation
I Quotation
have Quotation
only Quotation
half Quotation
an Quotation
hour." Quotation
My O
experience O
of O
camp O
life O
in O
Afghanistan O
had O
at O
least O
had O
the O
effect O
of O
making O
me O
a O
prompt O
and O
ready O
traveller. O
My O
wants O
were O
few O
and O
simple, O
so O
that O
in O
less O
than O
the O
time O
stated O
I Entity
was O
in O
a O
cab O
with O
my O
valise, O
rattling O
away O
to O
Paddington O
Station. O
Sherlock O
Holmes O
was O
pacing O
up O
and O
down O
the O
platform, O
his O
tall, O
gaunt O
figure O
made O
even O
gaunter O
and O
taller O
by O
his O
long O
grey O
travelling-cloak O
and O
close-fitting O
cloth O
cap. O
"It Quotation
is Quotation
really Quotation
very Quotation
good Quotation
of Quotation
you Quotation
to Quotation
come, Quotation
Watson," Quotation
said Cue
he. Entity
"It Quotation
makes Quotation
a Quotation
considerable Quotation
difference Quotation
to Quotation
me, Quotation
having Quotation
someone Quotation
with Quotation
me Quotation
on Quotation
whom Quotation
I Quotation
can Quotation
thoroughly Quotation
rely. Quotation
Local Quotation
aid Quotation
is Quotation
always Quotation
either Quotation
worthless Quotation
or Quotation
else Quotation
biassed. Quotation
If Quotation
you Quotation
will Quotation
keep Quotation
the Quotation
two Quotation
corner Quotation
seats Quotation
I Quotation
shall Quotation
get Quotation
the Quotation
tickets." Quotation
We O
had O
the O
carriage O
to O
ourselves O
save O
for O
an O
immense O
litter O
of O
papers O
which O
Holmes O
had O
brought O
with O
him. O
Among O
these O
he O
rummaged O
and O
read, O
with O
intervals O
of O
note-taking O
and O
of O
meditation, O
until O
we O
were O
past O
Reading. O
Then O
he O
suddenly O
rolled O
them O
all O
into O
a O
gigantic O
ball O
and O
tossed O
them O
up O
onto O
the O
rack. O
"Have Quotation
you Quotation
heard Quotation
anything Quotation
of Quotation
the Quotation
case?" Quotation
he Entity
asked. Cue
"Not Quotation
a Quotation
word. Quotation
I Quotation
have Quotation
not Quotation
seen Quotation
a Quotation
paper Quotation
for Quotation
some Quotation
days." Quotation
"The Quotation
London Quotation
press Quotation
has Quotation
not Quotation
had Quotation
very Quotation
full Quotation
accounts. Quotation
I Quotation
have Quotation
just Quotation
been Quotation
looking Quotation
through Quotation
all Quotation
the Quotation
recent Quotation
papers Quotation
in Quotation
order Quotation
to Quotation
master Quotation
the Quotation
particulars. Quotation
It Quotation
seems, Quotation
from Quotation
what Quotation
I Quotation
gather, Quotation
to Quotation
be Quotation
one Quotation
of Quotation
those Quotation
simple Quotation
cases Quotation
which Quotation
are Quotation
so Quotation
extremely Quotation
difficult." Quotation
"That Quotation
sounds Quotation
a Quotation
little Quotation
paradoxical." Quotation
"But Quotation
it Quotation
is Quotation
profoundly Quotation
true. Quotation
Singularity Quotation
is Quotation
almost Quotation
invariably Quotation
a Quotation
clue. Quotation
The Quotation
more Quotation
featureless Quotation
and Quotation
commonplace Quotation
a Quotation
crime Quotation
is, Quotation
the Quotation
more Quotation
difficult Quotation
it Quotation
is Quotation
to Quotation
bring Quotation
it Quotation
home. Quotation
In Quotation
this Quotation
case, Quotation
however, Quotation
they Quotation
have Quotation
established Quotation
a Quotation
very Quotation
serious Quotation
case Quotation
against Quotation
the Quotation
son Quotation
of Quotation
the Quotation
murdered Quotation
man." Quotation
"It Quotation
is Quotation
a Quotation
murder, Quotation
then?" Quotation
"Well, Quotation
it Quotation
is Quotation
conjectured Quotation
to Quotation
be Quotation
so. Quotation
I Quotation
shall Quotation
take Quotation
nothing Quotation
for Quotation
granted Quotation
until Quotation
I Quotation
have Quotation
the Quotation
opportunity Quotation
of Quotation
looking Quotation
personally Quotation
into Quotation
it. Quotation
I Quotation
will Quotation
explain Quotation
the Quotation
state Quotation
of Quotation
things Quotation
to Quotation
you, Quotation
as Quotation
far Quotation
as Quotation
I Quotation
have Quotation
been Quotation
able Quotation
to Quotation
understand Quotation
it, Quotation
in Quotation
a Quotation
very Quotation
few Quotation
words. Quotation
 Quotation
Boscombe Quotation
Valley Quotation
is Quotation
a Quotation
country Quotation
district Quotation
not Quotation
very Quotation
far Quotation
from Quotation
Ross, Quotation
in Quotation
Herefordshire. Quotation
The Quotation
largest Quotation
landed Quotation
proprietor Quotation
in Quotation
that Quotation
part Quotation
is Quotation
a Quotation
Mr. Quotation
John Quotation
Turner, Quotation
who Quotation
made Quotation
his Quotation
money Quotation
in Quotation
Australia Quotation
and Quotation
returned Quotation
some Quotation
years Quotation
ago Quotation
to Quotation
the Quotation
old Quotation
country. Quotation
One Quotation
of Quotation
the Quotation
farms Quotation
which Quotation
he Quotation
held, Quotation
that Quotation
of Quotation
Hatherley, Quotation
was Quotation
let Quotation
to Quotation
Mr. Quotation
Charles Quotation
McCarthy, Quotation
who Quotation
was Quotation
also Quotation
an Quotation
ex-Australian. Quotation
The Quotation
men Quotation
had Quotation
known Quotation
each Quotation
other Quotation
in Quotation
the Quotation
colonies, Quotation
so Quotation
that Quotation
it Quotation
was Quotation
not Quotation
unnatural Quotation
that Quotation
when Quotation
they Quotation
came Quotation
to Quotation
settle Quotation
down Quotation
they Quotation
should Quotation
do Quotation
so Quotation
as Quotation
near Quotation
each Quotation
other Quotation
as Quotation
possible. Quotation
Turner Quotation
was Quotation
apparently Quotation
the Quotation
richer Quotation
man, Quotation
so Quotation
McCarthy Quotation
became Quotation
his Quotation
tenant Quotation
but Quotation
still Quotation
remained, Quotation
it Quotation
seems, Quotation
upon Quotation
terms Quotation
of Quotation
perfect Quotation
equality, Quotation
as Quotation
they Quotation
were Quotation
frequently Quotation
together. Quotation
McCarthy Quotation
had Quotation
one Quotation
son, Quotation
a Quotation
lad Quotation
of Quotation
eighteen, Quotation
and Quotation
Turner Quotation
had Quotation
an Quotation
only Quotation
daughter Quotation
of Quotation
the Quotation
same Quotation
age, Quotation
but Quotation
neither Quotation
of Quotation
them Quotation
had Quotation
wives Quotation
living. Quotation
They Quotation
appear Quotation
to Quotation
have Quotation
avoided Quotation
the Quotation
society Quotation
of Quotation
the Quotation
neighbouring Quotation
English Quotation
families Quotation
and Quotation
to Quotation
have Quotation
led Quotation
retired Quotation
lives, Quotation
though Quotation
both Quotation
the Quotation
McCarthys Quotation
were Quotation
fond Quotation
of Quotation
sport Quotation
and Quotation
were Quotation
frequently Quotation
seen Quotation
at Quotation
the Quotation
race-meetings Quotation
of Quotation
the Quotation
neighbourhood. Quotation
McCarthy Quotation
kept Quotation
two Quotation
servants Quotation
-- Quotation
a Quotation
man Quotation
and Quotation
a Quotation
girl. Quotation
Turner Quotation
had Quotation
a Quotation
considerable Quotation
household, Quotation
some Quotation
half-dozen Quotation
at Quotation
the Quotation
least. Quotation
That Quotation
is Quotation
as Quotation
much Quotation
as Quotation
I Quotation
have Quotation
been Quotation
able Quotation
to Quotation
gather Quotation
about Quotation
the Quotation
families. Quotation
Now Quotation
for Quotation
the Quotation
facts. Quotation
 Quotation
On Quotation
June Quotation
3rd, Quotation
that Quotation
is, Quotation
on Quotation
Monday Quotation
last, Quotation
McCarthy Quotation
left Quotation
his Quotation
house Quotation
at Quotation
Hatherley Quotation
about Quotation
three Quotation
in Quotation
the Quotation
afternoon Quotation
and Quotation
walked Quotation
down Quotation
to Quotation
the Quotation
Boscombe Quotation
Pool, Quotation
which Quotation
is Quotation
a Quotation
small Quotation
lake Quotation
formed Quotation
by Quotation
the Quotation
spreading Quotation
out Quotation
of Quotation
the Quotation
stream Quotation
which Quotation
runs Quotation
down Quotation
the Quotation
Boscombe Quotation
Valley. Quotation
He Quotation
had Quotation
been Quotation
out Quotation
with Quotation
his Quotation
serving-man Quotation
in Quotation
the Quotation
morning Quotation
at Quotation
Ross, Quotation
and Quotation
he Quotation
had Quotation
told Quotation
the Quotation
man Quotation
that Quotation
he Quotation
must Quotation
hurry, Quotation
as Quotation
he Quotation
had Quotation
an Quotation
appointment Quotation
of Quotation
importance Quotation
to Quotation
keep Quotation
at Quotation
three. Quotation
From Quotation
that Quotation
appointment Quotation
he Quotation
never Quotation
came Quotation
back Quotation
alive. Quotation
 Quotation
From Quotation
Hatherley Quotation
Farm-house Quotation
to Quotation
the Quotation
Boscombe Quotation
Pool Quotation
is Quotation
a Quotation
quarter Quotation
of Quotation
a Quotation
mile, Quotation
and Quotation
two Quotation
people Quotation
saw Quotation
him Quotation
as Quotation
he Quotation
passed Quotation
over Quotation
this Quotation
ground. Quotation
One Quotation
was Quotation
an Quotation
old Quotation
woman, Quotation
whose Quotation
name Quotation
is Quotation
not Quotation
mentioned, Quotation
and Quotation
the Quotation
other Quotation
was Quotation
William Quotation
Crowder, Quotation
a Quotation
game-keeper Quotation
in Quotation
the Quotation
employ Quotation
of Quotation
Mr. Quotation
Turner. Quotation
Both Quotation
these Quotation
witnesses Quotation
depose Quotation
that Quotation
Mr. Quotation
McCarthy Quotation
was Quotation
walking Quotation
alone. Quotation
The Quotation
game-keeper Quotation
adds Quotation
that Quotation
within Quotation
a Quotation
few Quotation
minutes Quotation
of Quotation
his Quotation
seeing Quotation
Mr. Quotation
McCarthy Quotation
pass Quotation
he Quotation
had Quotation
seen Quotation
his Quotation
son, Quotation
Mr. Quotation
James Quotation
McCarthy, Quotation
going Quotation
the Quotation
same Quotation
way Quotation
with Quotation
a Quotation
gun Quotation
under Quotation
his Quotation
arm. Quotation
To Quotation
the Quotation
best Quotation
of Quotation
his Quotation
belief, Quotation
the Quotation
father Quotation
was Quotation
actually Quotation
in Quotation
sight Quotation
at Quotation
the Quotation
time, Quotation
and Quotation
the Quotation
son Quotation
was Quotation
following Quotation
him. Quotation
He Quotation
thought Quotation
no Quotation
more Quotation
of Quotation
the Quotation
matter Quotation
until Quotation
he Quotation
heard Quotation
in Quotation
the Quotation
evening Quotation
of Quotation
the Quotation
tragedy Quotation
that Quotation
had Quotation
occurred. Quotation
 Quotation
The Quotation
two Quotation
McCarthys Quotation
were Quotation
seen Quotation
after Quotation
the Quotation
time Quotation
when Quotation
William Quotation
Crowder, Quotation
the Quotation
game-keeper, Quotation
lost Quotation
sight Quotation
of Quotation
them. Quotation
The Quotation
Boscombe Quotation
Pool Quotation
is Quotation
thickly Quotation
wooded Quotation
round, Quotation
with Quotation
just Quotation
a Quotation
fringe Quotation
of Quotation
grass Quotation
and Quotation
of Quotation
reeds Quotation
round Quotation
the Quotation
edge. Quotation
A Quotation
girl Quotation
of Quotation
fourteen, Quotation
Patience Quotation
Moran, Quotation
who Quotation
is Quotation
the Quotation
daughter Quotation
of Quotation
the Quotation
lodge-keeper Quotation
of Quotation
the Quotation
Boscombe Quotation
Valley Quotation
estate, Quotation
was Quotation
in Quotation
one Quotation
of Quotation
the Quotation
woods Quotation
picking Quotation
flowers. Quotation
She Quotation
states Quotation
that Quotation
while Quotation
she Quotation
was Quotation
there Quotation
she Quotation
saw, Quotation
at Quotation
the Quotation
border Quotation
of Quotation
the Quotation
wood Quotation
and Quotation
close Quotation
by Quotation
the Quotation
lake, Quotation
Mr. Quotation
McCarthy Quotation
and Quotation
his Quotation
son, Quotation
and Quotation
that Quotation
they Quotation
appeared Quotation
to Quotation
be Quotation
having Quotation
a Quotation
violent Quotation
quarrel. Quotation
She Quotation
heard Quotation
Mr. Quotation
McCarthy Quotation
the Quotation
elder Quotation
using Quotation
very Quotation
strong Quotation
language Quotation
to Quotation
his Quotation
son, Quotation
and Quotation
she Quotation
saw Quotation
the Quotation
latter Quotation
raise Quotation
up Quotation
his Quotation
hand Quotation
as Quotation
if Quotation
to Quotation
strike Quotation
his Quotation
father. Quotation
She Quotation
was Quotation
so Quotation
frightened Quotation
by Quotation
their Quotation
violence Quotation
that Quotation
she Quotation
ran Quotation
away Quotation
and Quotation
told Quotation
her Quotation
mother Quotation
when Quotation
she Quotation
reached Quotation
home Quotation
that Quotation
she Quotation
had Quotation
left Quotation
the Quotation
two Quotation
McCarthys Quotation
quarrelling Quotation
near Quotation
Boscombe Quotation
Pool, Quotation
and Quotation
that Quotation
she Quotation
was Quotation
afraid Quotation
that Quotation
they Quotation
were Quotation
going Quotation
to Quotation
fight. Quotation
She Quotation
had Quotation
hardly Quotation
said Quotation
the Quotation
words Quotation
when Quotation
young Quotation
Mr. Quotation
McCarthy Quotation
came Quotation
running Quotation
up Quotation
to Quotation
the Quotation
lodge Quotation
to Quotation
say Quotation
that Quotation
he Quotation
had Quotation
found Quotation
his Quotation
father Quotation
dead Quotation
in Quotation
the Quotation
wood, Quotation
and Quotation
to Quotation
ask Quotation
for Quotation
the Quotation
help Quotation
of Quotation
the Quotation
lodge-keeper. Quotation
He Quotation
was Quotation
much Quotation
excited, Quotation
without Quotation
either Quotation
his Quotation
gun Quotation
or Quotation
his Quotation
hat, Quotation
and Quotation
his Quotation
right Quotation
hand Quotation
and Quotation
sleeve Quotation
were Quotation
observed Quotation
to Quotation
be Quotation
stained Quotation
with Quotation
fresh Quotation
blood. Quotation
On Quotation
following Quotation
him Quotation
they Quotation
found Quotation
the Quotation
dead Quotation
body Quotation
stretched Quotation
out Quotation
upon Quotation
the Quotation
grass Quotation
beside Quotation
the Quotation
pool. Quotation
The Quotation
head Quotation
had Quotation
been Quotation
beaten Quotation
in Quotation
by Quotation
repeated Quotation
blows Quotation
of Quotation
some Quotation
heavy Quotation
and Quotation
blunt Quotation
weapon. Quotation
The Quotation
injuries Quotation
were Quotation
such Quotation
as Quotation
might Quotation
very Quotation
well Quotation
have Quotation
been Quotation
inflicted Quotation
by Quotation
the Quotation
butt-end Quotation
of Quotation
his Quotation
son's Quotation
gun, Quotation
which Quotation
was Quotation
found Quotation
lying Quotation
on Quotation
the Quotation
grass Quotation
within Quotation
a Quotation
few Quotation
paces Quotation
of Quotation
the Quotation
body. Quotation
Under Quotation
these Quotation
circumstances Quotation
the Quotation
young Quotation
man Quotation
was Quotation
instantly Quotation
arrested, Quotation
and Quotation
a Quotation
verdict Quotation
of Quotation
'wilful Quotation
murder' Quotation
having Quotation
been Quotation
returned Quotation
at Quotation
the Quotation
inquest Quotation
on Quotation
Tuesday, Quotation
he Quotation
was Quotation
on Quotation
Wednesday Quotation
brought Quotation
before Quotation
the Quotation
magistrates Quotation
at Quotation
Ross, Quotation
who Quotation
have Quotation
referred Quotation
the Quotation
case Quotation
to Quotation
the Quotation
next Quotation
Assizes. Quotation
Those Quotation
are Quotation
the Quotation
main Quotation
facts Quotation
of Quotation
the Quotation
case Quotation
as Quotation
they Quotation
came Quotation
out Quotation
before Quotation
the Quotation
coroner Quotation
and Quotation
the Quotation
police-court." Quotation
"I Quotation
could Quotation
hardly Quotation
imagine Quotation
a Quotation
more Quotation
damning Quotation
case," Quotation
I Entity
remarked. Cue
"If Quotation
ever Quotation
circumstantial Quotation
evidence Quotation
pointed Quotation
to Quotation
a Quotation
criminal Quotation
it Quotation
does Quotation
so Quotation
here." Quotation
"Circumstantial Quotation
evidence Quotation
is Quotation
a Quotation
very Quotation
tricky Quotation
thing," Quotation
answered Cue
Holmes Entity
thoughtfully. O
"It Quotation
may Quotation
seem Quotation
to Quotation
point Quotation
very Quotation
straight Quotation
to Quotation
one Quotation
thing, Quotation
but Quotation
if Quotation
you Quotation
shift Quotation
your Quotation
own Quotation
point Quotation
of Quotation
view Quotation
a Quotation
little, Quotation
you Quotation
may Quotation
find Quotation
it Quotation
pointing Quotation
in Quotation
an Quotation
equally Quotation
uncompromising Quotation
manner Quotation
to Quotation
something Quotation
entirely Quotation
different. Quotation
It Quotation
must Quotation
be Quotation
confessed, Quotation
however, Quotation
that Quotation
the Quotation
case Quotation
looks Quotation
exceedingly Quotation
grave Quotation
against Quotation
the Quotation
young Quotation
man, Quotation
and Quotation
it Quotation
is Quotation
very Quotation
possible Quotation
that Quotation
he Quotation
is Quotation
indeed Quotation
the Quotation
culprit. Quotation
There Quotation
are Quotation
several Quotation
people Quotation
in Quotation
the Quotation
neighbourhood, Quotation
however, Quotation
and Quotation
among Quotation
them Quotation
Miss Quotation
Turner, Quotation
the Quotation
daughter Quotation
of Quotation
the Quotation
neighbouring Quotation
landowner, Quotation
who Quotation
believe Quotation
in Quotation
his Quotation
innocence, Quotation
and Quotation
who Quotation
have Quotation
retained Quotation
Lestrade, Quotation
whom Quotation
you Quotation
may Quotation
recollect Quotation
in Quotation
connection Quotation
with Quotation
the Quotation
Study Quotation
in Quotation
Scarlet, Quotation
to Quotation
work Quotation
out Quotation
the Quotation
case Quotation
in Quotation
his Quotation
interest. Quotation
Lestrade, Quotation
being Quotation
rather Quotation
puzzled, Quotation
has Quotation
referred Quotation
the Quotation
case Quotation
to Quotation
me, Quotation
and Quotation
hence Quotation
it Quotation
is Quotation
that Quotation
two Quotation
middle-aged Quotation
gentlemen Quotation
are Quotation
flying Quotation
westward Quotation
at Quotation
fifty Quotation
miles Quotation
an Quotation
hour Quotation
instead Quotation
of Quotation
quietly Quotation
digesting Quotation
their Quotation
breakfasts Quotation
at Quotation
home." Quotation
"I Quotation
am Quotation
afraid," Quotation
said Cue
I, Entity
"that Quotation
the Quotation
facts Quotation
are Quotation
so Quotation
obvious Quotation
that Quotation
you Quotation
will Quotation
find Quotation
little Quotation
credit Quotation

be Quotation
gained Quotation
out Quotation
of Quotation
this Quotation

"There Quotation
is Quotation
nothing Quotation
more Quotation
deceptive Quotation
than Quotation
an Quotation
obvious Quotation
fact," Quotation
he Entity
answered, Cue
laughing. O
"Besides, Quotation
we Quotation
may Quotation
chance Quotation
to Quotation
hit Quotation
upon Quotation
some Quotation
other Quotation
obvious Quotation
facts Quotation

no Quotation

either Quotation

quite Quotation

To Quotation
take Quotation
the Quotation
first Quotation

to Quotation
hand, Quotation
I Quotation
very Quotation
clearly Quotation
perceive Quotation
that Quotation
in Quotation
your Quotation

the Quotation

upon Quotation
the Quotation
right-hand Quotation

yet Quotation
I Quotation
question Quotation
whether Quotation
Mr. Quotation

so Quotation
self-evident Quotation
a Quotation
thing Quotation
as Quotation
that." Quotation

"My Quotation
dear Quotation

I Quotation
know Quotation
you Quotation
well. Quotation
I Quotation

the Quotation
military Quotation
neatness Quotation

you. Quotation
You Quotation
shave Quotation
every Quotation

in Quotation
this Quotation

you Quotation
shave Quotation
by Quotation
the Quotation

less Quotation

it Quotation

I O
shook O
my O
head. O
"Many Quotation

He O
picked O
out O
from O
his O
bundle O
a O
copy O
of O
the O
local O
Herefordshire O
paper, O
and O
having O
turned O
down O
the O
sheet O
he O
pointed O
out O
the O
paragraph O
in O
which O
the O
unfortunate O
young O
man O
had O
given O
his O
own O
statement O
of O
what O
had O
occurred. O
I O
settled O
myself O
down O
in O
the O
corner O
of O
the O
carriage O
and O
read O
it O
very O
carefully. O
It O
ran O
in O
this O
way: O
"Mr. O
James O
McCarthy, O
the O
only O
son O
of O
the O
deceased, O
was O
then O
called O
and O
gave O
evidence O
as O
follows: O
'I O
had O
been O
away O
from O
home O
for O
three O
days O
at O
Bristol, O
and O
had O
only O
just O
returned O
upon O
the O
morning O
of O
last O
Monday, O
the O
3rd. O
My O
father O
was O
absent O
from O
home O
at O
the O
time O
of O
my O
arrival, O
and O
I O
was O
informed O
by O
the O
maid O
that O
he O
had O
driven O
over O
to O
Ross O
with O
John O
Cobb, O
the O
groom. O
Shortly O
after O
my O
return O
I O
heard O
the O
wheels O
of O
his O
trap O
in O
the O
yard, O
and, O
looking O
out O
of O
my O
window, O
I O
saw O
him O
get O
out O
and O
walk O
rapidly O
out O
of O
the O
yard, O
though O
I O
was O
not O
aware O
in O
which O
direction O
he O
was O
going. O
I O
then O
took O
my O
gun O
and O
strolled O
out O
in O
the O
direction O
of O
the O
Boscombe O
Pool, O
with O
the O
intention O
of O
visiting O
the O
rabbit O
warren O
which O
is O
upon O
the O
other O
side. O
On O
my O
way O
I O
saw O
William O
Crowder, O
the O
game-keeper, O
as O
he O
had O
stated O
in O
his O
evidence; O
but O
he O
is O
mistaken O
in O
thinking O
that O
I O
was O
following O
my O
father. O
I O
had O
no O
idea O
that O
he O
was O
in O
front O
of O
me. O
When O
about O
a O
hundred O
yards O
from O
the O
pool O
I O
heard O
a O
cry O
of O
"Cooee!" O
which O
was O
a O
usual O
signal O
between O
my O
father O
and O
myself. O
I O
then O
hurried O
forward, O
and O
found O
him O
standing O
by O
the O
pool. O
He O
appeared O
to O
be O
much O
surprised O
at O
seeing O
me O
and O
asked O
me O
rather O
roughly O
what O
I O
was O
doing O
there. O
A O
conversation O
ensued O
which O
led O
to O
high O
words O
and O
almost O
to O
blows, O
for O
my O
father O
was O
a O
man O
of O
a O
very O
violent O
temper. O
Seeing O
that O
his O
passion O
was O
becoming O
ungovernable, O
I O
left O
him O
and O
returned O
towards O
Hatherley O
Farm. O
I O
had O
not O
gone O
more O
than O
150 O
yards, O
however, O
when O
I O
heard O
a O
hideous O
outcry O
behind O
me, O
which O
caused O
me O
to O
run O
back O
again. O
I O
found O
my O
father O
expiring O
upon O
the O
ground, O
with O
his O
head O
terribly O
injured. O
I O
dropped O
my O
gun O
and O
held O
him O
in O
my O
arms, O
but O
he O
almost O
instantly O
expired. O
I O
knelt O
beside O
him O
for O
some O
minutes, O
and O
then O
made O
my O
way O
to O
Mr. O
Turner's O
lodge-keeper, O
his O
house O
being O
the O
nearest, O
to O
ask O
for O
assistance. O
I O
saw O
no O
one O
near O
my O
father O
when O
I O
returned, O
and O
I O
have O
no O
idea O
how O
he O
came O
by O
his O
injuries. O
He O
was O
not O
a O
popular O
man, O
being O
somewhat O
cold O
and O
forbidding O
in O
his O
manners, O
but O
he O
had, O
as O
far O
as O
I O
know, O
no O
active O
enemies. O
I O
know O
nothing O
further O
of O
the O
matter.' O
 O
The O
Coroner: O
Did O
your O
father O
make O
any O
statement O
to O
you O
before O
he O
died? O
 O
Witness: O
He O
mumbled O
a O
few O
words, O
but O
I O
could O
only O
catch O
some O
allusion O
to O
a O
rat. O
 O
The O
Coroner: O
What O
did O
you O
understand O
by O
that? O
 O
Witness: O
It O
conveyed O
no O
meaning O
to O
me. O
I O
thought O
that O
he O
was O
delirious. O
 O
The O
Coroner: O
What O
was O
the O
point O
upon O
which O
you O
and O
your O
father O
had O
this O
final O
quarrel? O
 O
Witness: O
I O
should O
prefer O
not O
to O
answer. O
 O
The O
Coroner: O
I O
am O
afraid O
that O
I O
must O
press O
it. O
 O
Witness: O
It O
is O
really O
impossible O
for O
me O
to O
tell O
you. O
I O
can O
assure O
you O
that O
it O
has O
nothing O
to O
do O
with O
the O
sad O
tragedy O
which O
followed. O
 O
The O
Coroner: O
That O
is O
for O
the O
court O
to O
decide. O
I O
need O
not O
point O
out O
to O
you O
that O
your O
refusal O
to O
answer O
will O
prejudice O
your O
case O
considerably O
in O
any O
future O
proceedings O
which O
may O
arise. O
 O
Witness: O
I O
must O
still O
refuse. O
 O
The O
Coroner: O
I O
understand O
that O
the O
cry O
of O
'Cooee' O
was O
a O
common O
signal O
between O
you O
and O
your O
father? O
 O
Witness: O
It O
was. O
 O
The O
Coroner: O
How O
was O
it, O
then, O
that O
he O
uttered O
it O
before O
he O
saw O
you, O
and O
before O
he O
even O
knew O
that O
you O
had O
returned O
from O
Bristol? O
 O
Witness O
(with O
considerable O
confusion): O
I O
do O
not O
know. O
 O
A O
Juryman: O
Did O
you O
see O
nothing O
which O
aroused O
your O
suspicions O
when O
you O
returned O
on O
hearing O
the O
cry O
and O
found O
your O
father O
fatally O
injured? O
 O
Witness: O
Nothing O
definite. O
 O
The O
Coroner: O
What O
do O
you O
mean? O
 O
Witness: O
I O
was O
so O
disturbed O
and O
excited O
as O
I O
rushed O
out O
into O
the O
open, O
that O
I O
could O
think O
of O
nothing O
except O
of O
my O
father. O
Yet O
I O
have O
a O
vague O
impression O
that O
as O
I O
ran O
forward O
something O
lay O
upon O
the O
ground O
to O
the O
left O
of O
me. O
It O
seemed O
to O
me O
to O
be O
something O
grey O
in O
colour, O
a O
coat O
of O
some O
sort, O
or O
a O
plaid O
perhaps. O
When O
I O
rose O
from O
my O
father O
I O
looked O
round O
for O
it, O
but O
it O
was O
gone. O
 O
'Do O
you O
mean O
that O
it O
disappeared O
before O
you O
went O
for O
help?' O
 O
'Yes, O
it O
was O
gone.' O
 O
'You O
cannot O
say O
what O
it O
was?' O
 O
'No, O
I O
had O
a O
feeling O
something O
was O
there.' O
 O
'How O
far O
from O
the O
body?' O
 O
'A O
dozen O
yards O
or O
so.' O
 O
'And O
how O
far O
from O
the O
edge O
of O
the O
wood?' O
 O
'About O
the O
same.' O
 O
'Then O
if O
it O
was O
removed O
it O
was O
while O
you O
were O
within O
a O
dozen O
yards O
of O
it?' O
 O
'Yes, O
but O
with O
my O
back O
towards O
it.' O
 O
This O
concluded O
the O
examination O
of O
the O
witness." O
"I O
see," O
said O
I O
as O
I O
glanced O
down O
the O
column, O
"that O
the O
coroner O
in O
his O
concluding O
remarks O
was O
rather O
severe O
upon O
young O
McCarthy. O
He O
calls O
attention, O
and O
with O
reason, O
to O
the O
discrepancy O
about O
his O
father O
having O
signalled O
to O
him O
before O
seeing O
him, O
also O
to O
his O
refusal O
to O
give O
details O
of O
his O
conversation O
with O
his O
father, O
and O
his O
singular O
account O
of O
his O
father's O
dying O
words. O
They O
are O
all, O
as O
he O
remarks, O
very O
much O
against O
the O
son." O
Holmes O
laughed O
softly O
to O
himself O
and O
stretched O
himself O
out O
upon O
the O
cushioned O
seat. O
"Both O
you O
and O
the O
coroner O
have O
been O
at O
some O
pains," O
said O
he, O
"to O
single O
out O
the O
very O
strongest O
points O
in O
the O
young O
man's O
favour. O
Don't O
you O
see O
that O
you O
alternately O
give O
him O
credit O
for O
having O
too O
much O
imagination O
and O
too O
little? O
Too O
little, O
if O
he O
could O
not O
invent O
a O
cause O
of O
quarrel O
which O
would O
give O
him O
the O
sympathy O
of O
the O
jury; O
too O
much, O
if O
he O
evolved O
from O
his O
own O
inner O
consciousness O
anything O
so O
outré O
as O
a O
dying O
reference O
to O
a O
rat, O
and O
the O
incident O
of O
the O
vanishing O
cloth. O
No, O
sir, O
I O
shall O
approach O
this O
case O
from O
the O
point O
of O
view O
that O
what O
this O
young O
man O
says O
is O
true, O
and O
we O
shall O
see O
whither O
that O
hypothesis O
will O
lead O
us. O
And O
now O
here O
is O
my O
pocket O
Petrarch, O
and O
not O
another O
word O
shall O
I O
say O
of O
this O
case O
until O
we O
are O
on O
the O
scene O
of O
action. O
We O
lunch O
at O
Swindon, O
and O
I O
see O
that O
we O
shall O
be O
there O
in O
twenty O
minutes." O
It O
was O
nearly O
four O
o'clock O
when O
we O
at O
last, O
after O
passing O
through O
the O
beautiful O
Stroud O
Valley, O
and O
over O
the O
broad O
gleaming O
Severn, O
found O
ourselves O
at O
the O
pretty O
little O
country-town O
of O
Ross. O
A O
lean, O
ferret-like O
man, O
furtive O
and O
sly-looking, O
was O
waiting O
for O
us O
upon O
the O
platform. O
In O
spite O
of O
the O
light O
brown O
dustcoat O
and O
leather-leggings O
which O
he O
wore O
in O
deference O
to O
his O
rustic O
surroundings, O
I O
had O
no O
difficulty O
in O
recognising O
Lestrade, O
of O
Scotland O
Yard. O
With O
him O
we O
drove O
to O
the O
Hereford O
Arms O
where O
a O
room O
had O
already O
been O
engaged O
for O
us. O
"I O
have O
ordered O
a O
carriage," O
said O
Lestrade O
as O
we O
sat O
over O
a O
cup O
of O
tea. O
"I O
knew O
your O
energetic O
nature, O
and O
that O
you O
would O
not O
be O
happy O
until O
you O
had O
been O
on O
the O
scene O
of O
the O
crime." O
"It O
was O
very O
nice O
and O
complimentary O
of O
you," O
Holmes O
answered. O
"It O
is O
entirely O
a O
question O
of O
barometric O
pressure." O
Lestrade O
looked O
startled. O
"I O
do O
not O
quite O
follow," O
he O
said. O
"How O
is O
the O
glass? O
Twenty-nine, O
I O
see. O
No O
wind, O
and O
not O
a O
cloud O
in O
the O
sky. O
I O
have O
a O
caseful O
of O
cigarettes O
here O
which O
need O
smoking, O
and O
the O
sofa O
is O
very O
much O
superior O
to O
the O
usual O
country O
hotel O
abomination. O
I O
do O
not O
think O
that O
it O
is O
probable O
that O
I O
shall O
use O
the O
carriage O
to-night." O
Lestrade O
laughed O
indulgently. O
"You O
have, O
no O
doubt, O
already O
formed O
your O
conclusions O
from O
the O
newspapers," O
he O
said. O
"The O
case O
is O
as O
plain O
as O
a O
pikestaff, O
and O
the O
more O
one O
goes O
into O
it O
the O
plainer O
it O
becomes. O
Still, O
of O
course, O
one O
can't O
refuse O
a O
lady, O
and O
such O
a O
very O
positive O
one, O
too. O
She O
has O
heard O
of O
you, O
and O
would O
have O
your O
opinion, O
though O
I O
repeatedly O
told O
her O
that O
there O
was O
nothing O
which O
you O
could O
do O
which O
I O
had O
not O
already O
done. O
Why, O
bless O
my O
soul! O
here O
is O
her O
carriage O
at O
the O
door." O
He O
had O
hardly O
spoken O
before O
there O
rushed O
into O
the O
room O
one O
of O
the O
most O
lovely O
young O
women O
that O
I O
have O
ever O
seen O
in O
my O
life. O
Her O
violet O
eyes O
shining, O
her O
lips O
parted, O
a O
pink O
flush O
upon O
her O
cheeks, O
all O
thought O
of O
her O
natural O
reserve O
lost O
in O
her O
overpowering O
excitement O
and O
concern. O
"Oh, O
Mr. O
Sherlock O
Holmes!" O
she O
cried, O
glancing O
from O
one O
to O
the O
other O
of O
us, O
and O
finally, O
with O
a O
woman's O
quick O
intuition, O
fastening O
upon O
my O
companion, O
"I O
am O
so O
glad O
that O
you O
have O
come. O
I O
have O
driven O
down O
to O
tell O
you O
so. O
I O
know O
that O
James O
didn't O
do O
it. O
I O
know O
it, O
and O
I O
want O
you O
to O
start O
upon O
your O
work O
knowing O
it, O
too. O
Never O
let O
yourself O
doubt O
upon O
that O
point. O
We O
have O
known O
each O
other O
since O
we O
were O
little O
children, O
and O
I O
know O
his O
faults O
as O
no O
one O
else O
does; O
but O
he O
is O
too O
tender-hearted O
to O
hurt O
a O
fly. O
Such O
a O
charge O
is O
absurd O
to O
anyone O
who O
really O
knows O
him." O
"I O
hope O
we O
may O
clear O
him, O
Miss O
Turner," O
said O
Sherlock O
Holmes. O
"You O
may O
rely O
upon O
my O
doing O
all O
that O
I O
can." O
"But O
you O
have O
read O
the O
evidence. O
You O
have O
formed O
some O
conclusion? O
Do O
you O
not O
see O
some O
loophole, O
some O
flaw? O
Do O
you O
not O
yourself O
think O
that O
he O
is O
innocent?" O
"I O
think O
that O
it O
is O
very O
probable." O
"There, O
now!" O
she O
cried, O
throwing O
back O
her O
head O
and O
looking O
defiantly O
at O
Lestrade. O
"You O
hear! O
He O
gives O
me O
hopes." O
Lestrade O
shrugged O
his O
shoulders. O
"I O
am O
afraid O
that O
my O
colleague O
has O
been O
a O
little O
quick O
in O
forming O
his O
conclusions," O
he O
said. O
"But O
he O
is O
right. O
Oh! O
I O
know O
that O
he O
is O
right. O
James O
never O
did O
it. O
And O
about O
his O
quarrel O
with O
his O
father, O
I O
am O
sure O
that O
the O
reason O
why O
he O
would O
not O
speak O
about O
it O
to O
the O
coroner O
was O
because O
I O
was O
concerned O
in O
it." O
"In O
what O
way?" O
asked O
Holmes. O
"It O
is O
no O
time O
for O
me O
to O
hide O
anything. O
James O
and O
his O
father O
had O
many O
disagreements O
about O
me. O
Mr. O
McCarthy O
was O
very O
anxious O
that O
there O
should O
be O
a O
marriage O
between O
us. O
James O
and O
I O
have O
always O
loved O
each O
other O
as O
brother O
and O
sister; O
but O
of O
course O
he O
is O
young O
and O
has O
seen O
very O
little O
of O
life O
yet, O
and-- O
and-- O
well, O
he O
naturally O
did O
not O
wish O
to O
do O
anything O
like O
that O
yet. O
So O
there O
were O
quarrels, O
and O
this, O
I O
am O
sure, O
was O
one O
of O
them." O
"And O
your O
father?" O
asked O
Holmes. O
"Was O
he O
in O
favour O
of O
such O
a O
union?" O
"No, O
he O
was O
averse O
to O
it O
also. O
No O
one O
but O
Mr. O
McCarthy O
was O
in O
favour O
of O
it." O
A O
quick O
blush O
passed O
over O
her O
fresh O
young O
face O
as O
Holmes O
shot O
one O
of O
his O
keen, O
questioning O
glances O
at O
her. O
"Thank O
you O
for O
this O
information," O
said O
he. O
"May O
I O
see O
your O
father O
if O
I O
call O
to-morrow?" O
"I O
am O
afraid O
the O
doctor O
won't O
allow O
it." O
"The O
doctor?" O
"Yes, O
have O
you O
not O
heard? O
Poor O
father O
has O
never O
been O
strong O
for O
years O
back, O
but O
this O
has O
broken O
him O
down O
completely. O
He O
has O
taken O
to O
his O
bed, O
and O
Dr. O
Willows O
says O
that O
he O
is O
a O
wreck O
and O
that O
his O
nervous O
system O
is O
shattered. O
Mr. O
McCarthy O
was O
the O
only O
man O
alive O
who O
had O
known O
dad O
in O
the O
old O
days O
in O
Victoria." O
"Ha! O
In O
Victoria! O
That O
is O
important." O
"Yes, O
at O
the O
mines." O
"Quite O
so; O
at O
the O
gold-mines, O
where, O
as O
I O
understand, O
Mr. O
Turner O
made O
his O
money." O
"Yes, O
certainly." O
"Thank O
you, O
Miss O
Turner. O
You O
have O
been O
of O
material O
assistance O
to O
me." O
"You O
will O
tell O
me O
if O
you O
have O
any O
news O
to-morrow. O
No O
doubt O
you O
will O
go O
to O
the O
prison O
to O
see O
James. O
Oh, O
if O
you O
do, O
Mr. O
Holmes, O
do O
tell O
him O
that O
I O
know O
him O
to O
be O
innocent." O
"I O
will, O
Miss O
Turner." O
"I O
must O
go O
home O
now, O
for O
dad O
is O
very O
ill, O
and O
he O
misses O
me O
so O
if O
I O
leave O
him. O
Good-bye, O
and O
God O
help O
you O
in O
your O
undertaking." O
She O
hurried O
from O
the O
room O
as O
impulsively O
as O
she O
had O
entered, O
and O
we O
heard O
the O
wheels O
of O
her O
carriage O
rattle O
off O
down O
the O
street. O
"I O
am O
ashamed O
of O
you, O
Holmes," O
said O
Lestrade O
with O
dignity O
after O
a O
few O
minutes' O
silence. O
"Why O
should O
you O
raise O
up O
hopes O
which O
you O
are O
bound O
to O
disappoint? O
I O
am O
not O
over-tender O
of O
heart, O
but O
I O
call O
it O
cruel." O
"I O
think O
that O
I O
see O
my O
way O
to O
clearing O
James O
McCarthy," O
said O
Holmes. O
"Have O
you O
an O
order O
to O
see O
him O
in O
prison?" O
"Yes, O
but O
only O
for O
you O
and O
me." O
"Then O
I O
shall O
reconsider O
my O
resolution O
about O
going O
out. O
We O
have O
still O
time O
to O
take O
a O
train O
to O
Hereford O
and O
see O
him O
to-night?" O
"Ample." O
"Then O
let O
us O
do O
so. O
Watson, O
I O
fear O
that O
you O
will O
find O
it O
very O
slow, O
but O
I O
shall O
only O
be O
away O
a O
couple O
of O
hours." O
I O
walked O
down O
to O
the O
station O
with O
them, O
and O
then O
wandered O
through O
the O
streets O
of O
the O
little O
town, O
finally O
returning O
to O
the O
hotel, O
where O
I O
lay O
upon O
the O
sofa O
and O
tried O
to O
interest O
myself O
in O
a O
yellow-backed O
novel. O
The O
puny O
plot O
of O
the O
story O
was O
so O
thin, O
however, O
when O
compared O
to O
the O
deep O
mystery O
through O
which O
we O
were O
groping, O
and O
I O
found O
my O
attention O
wander O
so O
continually O
from O
the O
action O
to O
the O
fact, O
that O
I O
at O
last O
flung O
it O
across O
the O
room O
and O
gave O
myself O
up O
entirely O
to O
a O
consideration O
of O
the O
events O
of O
the O
day. O
Supposing O
that O
this O
unhappy O
young O
man's O
story O
were O
absolutely O
true, O
then O
what O
hellish O
thing, O
what O
absolutely O
unforeseen O
and O
extraordinary O
calamity O
could O
have O
occurred O
between O
the O
time O
when O
he O
parted O
from O
his O
father, O
and O
the O
moment O
when, O
drawn O
back O
by O
his O
screams, O
he O
rushed O
into O
the O
glade? O
It O
was O
something O
terrible O
and O
deadly. O
What O
could O
it O
be? O
Might O
not O
the O
nature O
of O
the O
injuries O
reveal O
something O
to O
my O
medical O
instincts? O
I O
rang O
the O
bell O
and O
called O
for O
the O
weekly O
county O
paper, O
which O
contained O
a O
verbatim O
account O
of O
the O
inquest. O
In O
the O
surgeon's O
deposition O
it O
was O
stated O
that O
the O
posterior O
third O
of O
the O
left O
parietal O
bone O
and O
the O
left O
half O
of O
the O
occipital O
bone O
had O
been O
shattered O
by O
a O
heavy O
blow O
from O
a O
blunt O
weapon. O
I O
marked O
the O
spot O
upon O
my O
own O
head. O
Clearly O
such O
a O
blow O
must O
have O
been O
struck O
from O
behind. O
That O
was O
to O
some O
extent O
in O
favour O
of O
the O
accused, O
as O
when O
seen O
quarrelling O
he O
was O
face O
to O
face O
with O
his O
father. O
Still, O
it O
did O
not O
go O
for O
very O
much, O
for O
the O
older O
man O
might O
have O
turned O
his O
back O
before O
the O
blow O
fell. O
Still, O
it O
might O
be O
worth O
while O
to O
call O
Holmes' O
attention O
to O
it. O
Then O
there O
was O
the O
peculiar O
dying O
reference O
to O
a O
rat. O
What O
could O
that O
mean? O
It O
could O
not O
be O
delirium. O
A O
man O
dying O
from O
a O
sudden O
blow O
does O
not O
commonly O
become O
delirious. O
No, O
it O
was O
more O
likely O
to O
be O
an O
attempt O
to O
explain O
how O
he O
met O
his O
fate. O
But O
what O
could O
it O
indicate? O
I O
cudgelled O
my O
brains O
to O
find O
some O
possible O
explanation. O
And O
then O
the O
incident O
of O
the O
grey O
cloth O
seen O
by O
young O
McCarthy. O
If O
that O
were O
true O
the O
murderer O
must O
have O
dropped O
some O
part O
of O
his O
dress, O
presumably O
his O
overcoat, O
in O
his O
flight, O
and O
must O
have O
had O
the O
hardihood O
to O
return O
and O
to O
carry O
it O
away O
at O
the O
instant O
when O
the O
son O
was O
kneeling O
with O
his O
back O
turned O
not O
a O
dozen O
paces O
off. O
What O
a O
tissue O
of O
mysteries O
and O
improbabilities O
the O
whole O
thing O
was! O
I O
did O
not O
wonder O
at O
Lestrade's O
opinion, O
and O
yet O
I O
had O
so O
much O
faith O
in O
Sherlock O
Holmes' O
insight O
that O
I O
could O
not O
lose O
hope O
as O
long O
as O
every O
fresh O
fact O
seemed O
to O
strengthen O
his O
conviction O
of O
young O
McCarthy's O
innocence. O
It O
was O
late O
before O
Sherlock O
Holmes O
returned. O
He O
came O
back O
alone, O
for O
Lestrade O
was O
staying O
in O
lodgings O
in O
the O
town. O
"The O
glass O
still O
keeps O
very O
high," O
he O
remarked O
as O
he O
sat O
down. O
"It O
is O
of O
importance O
that O
it O
should O
not O
rain O
before O
we O
are O
able O
to O
go O
over O
the O
ground. O
On O
the O
other O
hand, O
a O
man O
should O
be O
at O
his O
very O
best O
and O
keenest O
for O
such O
nice O
work O
as O
that, O
and O
I O
did O
not O
wish O
to O
do O
it O
when O
fagged O
by O
a O
long O
journey. O
I O
have O
seen O
young O
McCarthy." O
"And O
what O
did O
you O
learn O
from O
him?" O
"Nothing." O
"Could O
he O
throw O
no O
light?" O
"None O
at O
all. O
I O
was O
inclined O
to O
think O
at O
one O
time O
that O
he O
knew O
who O
had O
done O
it O
and O
was O
screening O
him O
or O
her, O
but O
I O
am O
convinced O
now O
that O
he O
is O
as O
puzzled O
as O
everyone O
else. O
He O
is O
not O
a O
very O
quick-witted O
youth, O
though O
comely O
to O
look O
at O
and, O
I O
should O
think, O
sound O
at O
heart." O
"I O
cannot O
admire O
his O
taste," O
I O
remarked, O
"if O
it O
is O
indeed O
a O
fact O
that O
he O
was O
averse O
to O
a O
marriage O
with O
so O
charming O
a O
young O
lady O
as O
this O
Miss O
Turner." O
"Ah, O
thereby O
hangs O
a O
rather O
painful O
tale. O
This O
fellow O
is O
madly, O
insanely, O
in O
love O
with O
her, O
but O
some O
two O
years O
ago, O
when O
he O
was O
only O
a O
lad, O
and O
before O
he O
really O
knew O
her, O
for O
she O
had O
been O
away O
five O
years O
at O
a O
boarding-school, O
what O
does O
the O
idiot O
do O
but O
get O
into O
the O
clutches O
of O
a O
barmaid O
in O
Bristol O
and O
marry O
her O
at O
a O
registry O
office? O
No O
one O
knows O
a O
word O
of O
the O
matter, O
but O
you O
can O
imagine O
how O
maddening O
it O
must O
be O
to O
him O
to O
be O
upbraided O
for O
not O
doing O
what O
he O
would O
give O
his O
very O
eyes O
to O
do, O
but O
what O
he O
knows O
to O
be O
absolutely O
impossible. O
It O
was O
sheer O
frenzy O
of O
this O
sort O
which O
made O
him O
throw O
his O
hands O
up O
into O
the O
air O
when O
his O
father, O
at O
their O
last O
interview, O
was O
goading O
him O
on O
to O
propose O
to O
Miss O
Turner. O
On O
the O
other O
hand, O
he O
had O
no O
means O
of O
supporting O
himself, O
and O
his O
father, O
who O
was O
by O
all O
accounts O
a O
very O
hard O
man, O
would O
have O
thrown O
him O
over O
utterly O
had O
he O
known O
the O
truth. O
It O
was O
with O
his O
barmaid O
wife O
that O
he O
had O
spent O
the O
last O
three O
days O
in O
Bristol, O
and O
his O
father O
did O
not O
know O
where O
he O
was. O
Mark O
that O
point. O
It O
is O
of O
importance. O
Good O
has O
come O
out O
of O
evil, O
however, O
for O
the O
barmaid, O
finding O
from O
the O
papers O
that O
he O
is O
in O
serious O
trouble O
and O
likely O
to O
be O
hanged, O
has O
thrown O
him O
over O
utterly O
and O
has O
written O
to O
him O
to O
say O
that O
she O
has O
a O
husband O
already O
in O
the O
Bermuda O
Dockyard, O
so O
that O
there O
is O
really O
no O
tie O
between O
them. O
I O
think O
that O
that O
bit O
of O
news O
has O
consoled O
young O
McCarthy O
for O
all O
that O
he O
has O
suffered." O
"But O
if O
he O
is O
innocent, O
who O
has O
done O
it?" O
"Ah! O
who? O
I O
would O
call O
your O
attention O
very O
particularly O
to O
two O
points. O
One O
is O
that O
the O
murdered O
man O
had O
an O
appointment O
with O
someone O
at O
the O
pool, O
and O
that O
the O
someone O
could O
not O
have O
been O
his O
son, O
for O
his O
son O
was O
away, O
and O
he O
did O
not O
know O
when O
he O
would O
return. O
The O
second O
is O
that O
the O
murdered O
man O
was O
heard O
to O
cry O
'Cooee!' O
before O
he O
knew O
that O
his O
son O
had O
returned. O
Those O
are O
the O
crucial O
points O
upon O
which O
the O
case O
depends. O
And O
now O
let O
us O
talk O
about O
George O
Meredith, O
if O
you O
please, O
and O
we O
shall O
leave O
all O
minor O
matters O
until O
to-morrow." O
There O
was O
no O
rain, O
as O
Holmes O
had O
foretold, O
and O
the O
morning O
broke O
bright O
and O
cloudless. O
At O
nine O
o'clock O
Lestrade O
called O
for O
us O
with O
the O
carriage, O
and O
we O
set O
off O
for O
Hatherley O
Farm O
and O
the O
Boscombe O
Pool. O
"There O
is O
serious O
news O
this O
morning," O
Lestrade O
observed. O
"It O
is O
said O
that O
Mr. O
Turner, O
of O
the O
Hall, O
is O
so O
ill O
that O
his O
life O
is O
despaired O
of." O
"An O
elderly O
man, O
I O
presume?" O
said O
Holmes. O
"About O
sixty; O
but O
his O
constitution O
has O
been O
shattered O
by O
his O
life O
abroad, O
and O
he O
has O
been O
in O
failing O
health O
for O
some O
time. O
This O
business O
has O
had O
a O
very O
bad O
effect O
upon O
him. O
He O
was O
an O
old O
friend O
of O
McCarthy's, O
and, O
I O
may O
add, O
a O
great O
benefactor O
to O
him, O
for O
I O
have O
learned O
that O
he O
gave O
him O
Hatherley O
Farm O
rent O
free." O
"Indeed! O
That O
is O
interesting," O
said O
Holmes. O
"Oh, O
yes! O
In O
a O
hundred O
other O
ways O
he O
has O
helped O
him. O
Everybody O
about O
here O
speaks O
of O
his O
kindness O
to O
him." O
"Really! O
Does O
it O
not O
strike O
you O
as O
a O
little O
singular O
that O
this O
McCarthy, O
who O
appears O
to O
have O
had O
little O
of O
his O
own, O
and O
to O
have O
been O
under O
such O
obligations O
to O
Turner, O
should O
still O
talk O
of O
marrying O
his O
son O
to O
Turner's O
daughter, O
who O
is, O
presumably, O
heiress O
to O
the O
estate, O
and O
that O
in O
such O
a O
very O
cocksure O
manner, O
as O
if O
it O
were O
merely O
a O
case O
of O
a O
proposal O
and O
all O
else O
would O
follow? O
It O
is O
the O
more O
strange, O
since O
we O
know O
that O
Turner O
himself O
was O
averse O
to O
the O
idea. O
The O
daughter O
told O
us O
as O
much. O
Do O
you O
not O
deduce O
something O
from O
that?" O
"We O
have O
got O
to O
the O
deductions O
and O
the O
inferences," O
said O
Lestrade, O
winking O
at O
me. O
"I O
find O
it O
hard O
enough O
to O
tackle O
facts, O
Holmes, O
without O
flying O
away O
after O
theories O
and O
fancies." O
"You O
are O
right," O
said O
Holmes O
demurely; O
"you O
do O
find O
it O
very O
hard O
to O
tackle O
the O
facts." O
"Anyhow, O
I O
have O
grasped O
one O
fact O
which O
you O
seem O
to O
find O
it O
difficult O
to O
get O
hold O
of," O
replied O
Lestrade O
with O
some O
warmth. O
"And O
that O
is O
-- O
" O
"That O
McCarthy O
senior O
met O
his O
death O
from O
McCarthy O
junior O
and O
that O
all O
theories O
to O
the O
contrary O
are O
the O
merest O
moonshine." O
"Well, O
moonshine O
is O
a O
brighter O
thing O
than O
fog," O
said O
Holmes, O
laughing. O
"But O
I O
am O
very O
much O
mistaken O
if O
this O
is O
not O
Hatherley O
Farm O
upon O
the O
left." O
"Yes, O
that O
is O
it." O
It O
was O
a O
widespread, O
comfortable-looking O
building, O
two-storied, O
slate-roofed, O
with O
great O
yellow O
blotches O
of O
lichen O
upon O
the O
grey O
walls. O
The O
drawn O
blinds O
and O
the O
smokeless O
chimneys, O
however, O
gave O
it O
a O
stricken O
look, O
as O
though O
the O
weight O
of O
this O
horror O
still O
lay O
heavy O
upon O
it. O
We O
called O
at O
the O
door, O
when O
the O
maid, O
at O
Holmes' O
request, O
showed O
us O
the O
boots O
which O
her O
master O
wore O
at O
the O
time O
of O
his O
death, O
and O
also O
a O
pair O
of O
the O
son's, O
though O
not O
the O
pair O
which O
he O
had O
then O
had. O
Having O
measured O
these O
very O
carefully O
from O
seven O
or O
eight O
different O
points, O
Holmes O
desired O
to O
be O
led O
to O
the O
court-yard, O
from O
which O
we O
all O
followed O
the O
winding O
track O
which O
led O
to O
Boscombe O
Pool. O
Sherlock O
Holmes O
was O
transformed O
when O
he O
was O
hot O
upon O
such O
a O
scent O
as O
this. O
Men O
who O
had O
only O
known O
the O
quiet O
thinker O
and O
logician O
of O
Baker O
Street O
would O
have O
failed O
to O
recognise O
him. O
His O
face O
flushed O
and O
darkened. O
His O
brows O
were O
drawn O
into O
two O
hard O
black O
lines, O
while O
his O
eyes O
shone O
out O
from O
beneath O
them O
with O
a O
steely O
glitter. O
His O
face O
was O
bent O
downward, O
his O
shoulders O
bowed, O
his O
lips O
compressed, O
and O
the O
veins O
stood O
out O
like O
whipcord O
in O
his O
long, O
sinewy O
neck. O
His O
nostrils O
seemed O
to O
dilate O
with O
a O
purely O
animal O
lust O
for O
the O
chase, O
and O
his O
mind O
was O
so O
absolutely O
concentrated O
upon O
the O
matter O
before O
him O
that O
a O
question O
or O
remark O
fell O
unheeded O
upon O
his O
ears, O
or, O
at O
the O
most, O
only O
provoked O
a O
quick, O
impatient O
snarl O
in O
reply. O
Swiftly O
and O
silently O
he O
made O
his O
way O
along O
the O
track O
which O
ran O
through O
the O
meadows, O
and O
so O
by O
way O
of O
the O
woods O
to O
the O
Boscombe O
Pool. O
It O
was O
damp, O
marshy O
ground, O
as O
is O
all O
that O
district, O
and O
there O
were O
marks O
of O
many O
feet, O
both O
upon O
the O
path O
and O
amid O
the O
short O
grass O
which O
bounded O
it O
on O
either O
side. O
Sometimes O
Holmes O
would O
hurry O
on, O
sometimes O
stop O
dead, O
and O
once O
he O
made O
quite O
a O
little O
detour O
into O
the O
meadow. O
Lestrade O
and O
I O
walked O
behind O
him, O
the O
detective O
indifferent O
and O
contemptuous, O
while O
I O
watched O
my O
friend O
with O
the O
interest O
which O
sprang O
from O
the O
conviction O
that O
every O
one O
of O
his O
actions O
was O
directed O
towards O
a O
definite O
end. O
The O
Boscombe O
Pool, O
which O
is O
a O
little O
reed-girt O
sheet O
of O
water O
some O
fifty O
yards O
across, O
is O
situated O
at O
the O
boundary O
between O
the O
Hatherley O
Farm O
and O
the O
private O
park O
of O
the O
wealthy O
Mr. O
Turner. O
Above O
the O
woods O
which O
lined O
it O
upon O
the O
farther O
side O
we O
could O
see O
the O
red, O
jutting O
pinnacles O
which O
marked O
the O
site O
of O
the O
rich O
landowner's O
dwelling. O
On O
the O
Hatherley O
side O
of O
the O
pool O
the O
woods O
grew O
very O
thick, O
and O
there O
was O
a O
narrow O
belt O
of O
sodden O
grass O
twenty O
paces O
across O
between O
the O
edge O
of O
the O
trees O
and O
the O
reeds O
which O
lined O
the O
lake. O
Lestrade O
showed O
us O
the O
exact O
spot O
at O
which O
the O
body O
had O
been O
found, O
and, O
indeed, O
so O
moist O
was O
the O
ground, O
that O
I O
could O
plainly O
see O
the O
traces O
which O
had O
been O
left O
by O
the O
fall O
of O
the O
stricken O
man. O
To O
Holmes, O
as O
I O
could O
see O
by O
his O
eager O
face O
and O
peering O
eyes, O
very O
many O
other O
things O
were O
to O
be O
read O
upon O
the O
trampled O
grass. O
He O
ran O
round, O
like O
a O
dog O
who O
is O
picking O
up O
a O
scent, O
and O
then O
turned O
upon O
my O
companion. O
"What O
did O
you O
go O
into O
the O
pool O
for?" O
he O
asked. O
"I O
fished O
about O
with O
a O
rake. O
I O
thought O
there O
might O
be O
some O
weapon O
or O
other O
trace. O
But O
how O
on O
earth O
-- O
" O
"Oh, O
tut, O
tut! O
I O
have O
no O
time! O
That O
left O
foot O
of O
yours O
with O
its O
inward O
twist O
is O
all O
over O
the O
place. O
A O
mole O
could O
trace O
it, O
and O
there O
it O
vanishes O
among O
the O
reeds. O
Oh, O
how O
simple O
it O
would O
all O
have O
been O
had O
I O
been O
here O
before O
they O
came O
like O
a O
herd O
of O
buffalo O
and O
wallowed O
all O
over O
it. O
Here O
is O
where O
the O
party O
with O
the O
lodge-keeper O
came, O
and O
they O
have O
covered O
all O
tracks O
for O
six O
or O
eight O
feet O
round O
the O
body. O
But O
here O
are O
three O
separate O
tracks O
of O
the O
same O
feet." O
He O
drew O
out O
a O
lens O
and O
lay O
down O
upon O
his O
waterproof O
to O
have O
a O
better O
view, O
talking O
all O
the O
time O
rather O
to O
himself O
than O
to O
us. O
"These O
are O
young O
McCarthy's O
feet. O
Twice O
he O
was O
walking, O
and O
once O
he O
ran O
swiftly, O
so O
that O
the O
soles O
are O
deeply O
marked O
and O
the O
heels O
hardly O
visible. O
That O
bears O
out O
his O
story. O
He O
ran O
when O
he O
saw O
his O
father O
on O
the O
ground. O
Then O
here O
are O
the O
father's O
feet O
as O
he O
paced O
up O
and O
down. O
What O
is O
this, O
then? O
It O
is O
the O
butt-end O
of O
the O
gun O
as O
the O
son O
stood O
listening. O
And O
this? O
Ha, O
ha! O
What O
have O
we O
here? O
Tiptoes! O
tiptoes! O
Square, O
too, O
quite O
unusual O
boots! O
They O
come, O
they O
go, O
they O
come O
again-- O
of O
course O
that O
was O
for O
the O
cloak. O
Now O
where O
did O
they O
come O
from?" O
He O
ran O
up O
and O
down, O
sometimes O
losing, O
sometimes O
finding O
the O
track O
until O
we O
were O
well O
within O
the O
edge O
of O
the O
wood O
and O
under O
the O
shadow O
of O
a O
great O
beech, O
the O
largest O
tree O
in O
the O
neighbourhood. O
Holmes O
traced O
his O
way O
to O
the O
farther O
side O
of O
this O
and O
lay O
down O
once O
more O
upon O
his O
face O
with O
a O
little O
cry O
of O
satisfaction. O
For O
a O
long O
time O
he O
remained O
there, O
turning O
over O
the O
leaves O
and O
dried O
sticks, O
gathering O
up O
what O
seemed O
to O
me O
to O
be O
dust O
into O
an O
envelope O
and O
examining O
with O
his O
lens O
not O
only O
the O
ground O
but O
even O
the O
bark O
of O
the O
tree O
as O
far O
as O
he O
could O
reach. O
A O
jagged O
stone O
was O
lying O
among O
the O
moss, O
and O
this O
also O
he O
carefully O
examined O
and O
retained. O
Then O
he O
followed O
a O
pathway O
through O
the O
wood O
until O
he O
came O
to O
the O
highroad, O
where O
all O
traces O
were O
lost. O
"It O
has O
been O
a O
case O
of O
considerable O
interest," O
he O
remarked, O
returning O
to O
his O
natural O
manner. O
"I O
fancy O
that O
this O
grey O
house O
on O
the O
right O
must O
be O
the O
lodge. O
I O
think O
that O
I O
will O
go O
in O
and O
have O
a O
word O
with O
Moran, O
and O
perhaps O
write O
a O
little O
note. O
Having O
done O
that, O
we O
may O
drive O
back O
to O
our O
luncheon. O
You O
may O
walk O
to O
the O
cab, O
and O
I O
shall O
be O
with O
you O
presently." O
It O
was O
about O
ten O
minutes O
before O
we O
regained O
our O
cab O
and O
drove O
back O
into O
Ross, O
Holmes O
still O
carrying O
with O
him O
the O
stone O
which O
he O
had O
picked O
up O
in O
the O
wood. O
"This O
may O
interest O
you, O
Lestrade," O
he O
remarked, O
holding O
it O
out. O
"The O
murder O
was O
done O
with O
it." O
"I O
see O
no O
marks." O
"There O
are O
none." O
"How O
do O
you O
know, O
then?" O
"The O
grass O
was O
growing O
under O
it. O
It O
had O
only O
lain O
there O
a O
few O
days. O
There O
was O
no O
sign O
of O
a O
place O
whence O
it O
had O
been O
taken. O
It O
corresponds O
with O
the O
injuries. O
There O
is O
no O
sign O
of O
any O
other O
weapon." O
"And O
the O
murderer?" O
"Is O
a O
tall O
man, O
left-handed, O
limps O
with O
the O
right O
leg, O
wears O
thick-soled O
shooting-boots O
and O
a O
grey O
cloak, O
smokes O
Indian O
cigars, O
uses O
a O
cigar-holder, O
and O
carries O
a O
blunt O
pen-knife O
in O
his O
pocket. O
There O
are O
several O
other O
indications, O
but O
these O
may O
be O
enough O
to O
aid O
us O
in O
our O
search." O
Lestrade O
laughed. O
"I O
am O
afraid O
that O
I O
am O
still O
a O
sceptic," O
he O
said. O
"Theories O
are O
all O
very O
well, O
but O
we O
have O
to O
deal O
with O
a O
hard-headed O
British O
jury." O
"Nous O
verrons," O
answered O
Holmes O
calmly. O
"You O
work O
your O
own O
method, O
and O
I O
shall O
work O
mine. O
I O
shall O
be O
busy O
this O
afternoon, O
and O
shall O
probably O
return O
to O
London O
by O
the O
evening O
train." O
"And O
leave O
your O
case O
unfinished?" O
"No, O
finished." O
"But O
the O
mystery?" O
"It O
is O
solved." O
"Who O
was O
the O
criminal, O
then?" O
"The O
gentleman O
I O
describe." O
"But O
who O
is O
he?" O
"Surely O
it O
would O
not O
be O
difficult O
to O
find O
out. O
This O
is O
not O
such O
a O
populous O
neighbourhood." O
Lestrade O
shrugged O
his O
shoulders. O
"I O
am O
a O
practical O
man," O
he O
said, O
"and O
I O
really O
cannot O
undertake O
to O
go O
about O
the O
country O
looking O
for O
a O
left-handed O
gentleman O
with O
a O
game O
leg. O
I O
should O
become O
the O
laughing-stock O
of O
Scotland O
Yard." O
"All O
right," O
said O
Holmes O
quietly. O
"I O
have O
given O
you O
the O
chance. O
Here O
are O
your O
lodgings. O
Good-bye. O
I O
shall O
drop O
you O
a O
line O
before O
I O
leave." O
Having O
left O
Lestrade O
at O
his O
rooms, O
we O
drove O
to O
our O
hotel, O
where O
we O
found O
lunch O
upon O
the O
table. O
Holmes O
was O
silent O
and O
buried O
in O
thought O
with O
a O
pained O
expression O
upon O
his O
face, O
as O
one O
who O
finds O
himself O
in O
a O
perplexing O
position. O
"Look O
here, O
Watson," O
he O
said O
when O
the O
cloth O
was O
cleared O
"just O
sit O
down O
in O
this O
chair O
and O
let O
me O
preach O
to O
you O
for O
a O
little. O
I O
don't O
know O
quite O
what O
to O
do, O
and O
I O
should O
value O
your O
advice. O
Light O
a O
cigar O
and O
let O
me O
expound." O
"Pray O
do O
so." O
"Well, O
now, O
in O
considering O
this O
case O
there O
are O
two O
points O
about O
young O
McCarthy's O
narrative O
which O
struck O
us O
both O
instantly, O
although O
they O
impressed O
me O
in O
his O
favour O
and O
you O
against O
him. O
One O
was O
the O
fact O
that O
his O
father O
should, O
according O
to O
his O
account, O
cry O
'Cooee!' O
before O
seeing O
him. O
The O
other O
was O
his O
singular O
dying O
reference O
to O
a O
rat. O
He O
mumbled O
several O
words, O
you O
understand, O
but O
that O
was O
all O
that O
caught O
the O
son's O
ear. O
Now O
from O
this O
double O
point O
our O
research O
must O
commence, O
and O
we O
will O
begin O
it O
by O
presuming O
that O
what O
the O
lad O
says O
is O
absolutely O
true." O
"What O
of O
this O
'Cooee!' O
then?" O
"Well, O
obviously O
it O
could O
not O
have O
been O
meant O
for O
the O
son. O
The O
son, O
as O
far O
as O
he O
knew, O
was O
in O
Bristol. O
It O
was O
mere O
chance O
that O
he O
was O
within O
earshot. O
The O
'Cooee!' O
was O
meant O
to O
attract O
the O
attention O
of O
whoever O
it O
was O
that O
he O
had O
the O
appointment O
with. O
But O
'Cooee' O
is O
a O
distinctly O
Australian O
cry, O
and O
one O
which O
is O
used O
between O
Australians. O
There O
is O
a O
strong O
presumption O
that O
the O
person O
whom O
McCarthy O
expected O
to O
meet O
him O
at O
Boscombe O
Pool O
was O
someone O
who O
had O
been O
in O
Australia." O
"What O
of O
the O
rat, O
then?" O
Sherlock O
Holmes O
took O
a O
folded O
paper O
from O
his O
pocket O
and O
flattened O
it O
out O
on O
the O
table. O
"This O
is O
a O
map O
of O
the O
Colony O
of O
Victoria," O
he O
said. O
"I O
wired O
to O
Bristol O
for O
it O
last O
night." O
He O
put O
his O
hand O
over O
part O
of O
the O
map. O
"What O
do O
you O
read?" O
"ARAT," O
I O
read. O
"And O
now?" O
He O
raised O
his O
hand. O
"BALLARAT." O
"Quite O
so. O
That O
was O
the O
word O
the O
man O
uttered, O
and O
of O
which O
his O
son O
only O
caught O
the O
last O
two O
syllables. O
He O
was O
trying O
to O
utter O
the O
name O
of O
his O
murderer. O
So O
and O
so, O
of O
Ballarat." O
"It O
is O
wonderful!" O
I O
exclaimed. O
"It O
is O
obvious. O
And O
now, O
you O
see, O
I O
had O
narrowed O
the O
field O
down O
considerably. O
The O
possession O
of O
a O
grey O
garment O
was O
a O
third O
point O
which, O
granting O
the O
son's O
statement O
to O
be O
correct, O
was O
a O
certainty. O
We O
have O
come O
now O
out O
of O
mere O
vagueness O
to O
the O
definite O
conception O
of O
an O
Australian O
from O
Ballarat O
with O
a O
grey O
cloak." O
"Certainly." O
"And O
one O
who O
was O
at O
home O
in O
the O
district, O
for O
the O
pool O
can O
only O
be O
approached O
by O
the O
farm O
or O
by O
the O
estate, O
where O
strangers O
could O
hardly O
wander." O
"Quite O
so." O
"Then O
comes O
our O
expedition O
of O
to-day. O
By O
an O
examination O
of O
the O
ground O
I O
gained O
the O
trifling O
details O
which O
I O
gave O
to O
that O
imbecile O
Lestrade, O
as O
to O
the O
personality O
of O
the O
criminal." O
"But O
how O
did O
you O
gain O
them?" O
"You O
know O
my O
method. O
It O
is O
founded O
upon O
the O
observation O
of O
trifles." O
"His O
height O
I O
know O
that O
you O
might O
roughly O
judge O
from O
the O
length O
of O
his O
stride. O
His O
boots, O
too, O
might O
be O
told O
from O
their O
traces." O
"Yes, O
they O
were O
peculiar O
boots." O
"But O
his O
lameness?" O
"The O
impression O
of O
his O
right O
foot O
was O
always O
less O
distinct O
than O
his O
left. O
He O
put O
less O
weight O
upon O
it. O
Why? O
Because O
he O
limped-- O
he O
was O
lame." O
"But O
his O
left-handedness." O
"You O
were O
yourself O
struck O
by O
the O
nature O
of O
the O
injury O
as O
recorded O
by O
the O
surgeon O
at O
the O
inquest. O
The O
blow O
was O
struck O
from O
immediately O
behind, O
and O
yet O
was O
upon O
the O
left O
side. O
Now, O
how O
can O
that O
be O
unless O
it O
were O
by O
a O
left-handed O
man? O
He O
had O
stood O
behind O
that O
tree O
during O
the O
interview O
between O
the O
father O
and O
son. O
He O
had O
even O
smoked O
there. O
I O
found O
the O
ash O
of O
a O
cigar, O
which O
my O
special O
knowledge O
of O
tobacco O
ashes O
enables O
me O
to O
pronounce O
as O
an O
Indian O
cigar. O
I O
have, O
as O
you O
know, O
devoted O
some O
attention O
to O
this, O
and O
written O
a O
little O
monograph O
on O
the O
ashes O
of O
140 O
different O
varieties O
of O
pipe, O
cigar, O
and O
cigarette O
tobacco. O
Having O
found O
the O
ash, O
I O
then O
looked O
round O
and O
discovered O
the O
stump O
among O
the O
moss O
where O
he O
had O
tossed O
it. O
It O
was O
an O
Indian O
cigar, O
of O
the O
variety O
which O
are O
rolled O
in O
Rotterdam." O
"And O
the O
cigar-holder?" O
"I O
could O
see O
that O
the O
end O
had O
not O
been O
in O
his O
mouth. O
Therefore O
he O
used O
a O
holder. O
The O
tip O
had O
been O
cut O
off, O
not O
bitten O
off, O
but O
the O
cut O
was O
not O
a O
clean O
one, O
so O
I O
deduced O
a O
blunt O
pen-knife." O
"Holmes," O
I O
said, O
"you O
have O
drawn O
a O
net O
round O
this O
man O
from O
which O
he O
cannot O
escape, O
and O
you O
have O
saved O
an O
innocent O
human O
life O
as O
truly O
as O
if O
you O
had O
cut O
the O
cord O
which O
was O
hanging O
him. O
I O
see O
the O
direction O
in O
which O
all O
this O
points. O
The O
culprit O
is O
-- O
" O
"Mr. O
John O
Turner," O
cried O
the O
hotel O
waiter, O
opening O
the O
door O
of O
our O
sitting-room, O
and O
ushering O
in O
a O
visitor. O
The O
man O
who O
entered O
was O
a O
strange O
and O
impressive O
figure. O
His O
slow, O
limping O
step O
and O
bowed O
shoulders O
gave O
the O
appearance O
of O
decrepitude, O
and O
yet O
his O
hard, O
deep-lined, O
craggy O
features, O
and O
his O
enormous O
limbs O
showed O
that O
he O
was O
possessed O
of O
unusual O
strength O
of O
body O
and O
of O
character. O
His O
tangled O
beard, O
grizzled O
hair, O
and O
outstanding, O
drooping O
eyebrows O
combined O
to O
give O
an O
air O
of O
dignity O
and O
power O
to O
his O
appearance, O
but O
his O
face O
was O
of O
an O
ashen O
white, O
while O
his O
lips O
and O
the O
corners O
of O
his O
nostrils O
were O
tinged O
with O
a O
shade O
of O
blue. O
It O
was O
clear O
to O
me O
at O
a O
glance O
that O
he O
was O
in O
the O
grip O
of O
some O
deadly O
and O
chronic O
disease. O
"Pray O
sit O
down O
on O
the O
sofa," O
said O
Holmes O
gently. O
"You O
had O
my O
note?" O
"Yes, O
the O
lodge-keeper O
brought O
it O
up. O
You O
said O
that O
you O
wished O
to O
see O
me O
here O
to O
avoid O
scandal." O
"I O
thought O
people O
would O
talk O
if O
I O
went O
to O
the O
Hall." O
"And O
why O
did O
you O
wish O
to O
see O
me?" O
He O
looked O
across O
at O
my O
companion O
with O
despair O
in O
his O
weary O
eyes, O
as O
though O
his O
question O
was O
already O
answered. O
"Yes," O
said O
Holmes, O
answering O
the O
look O
rather O
than O
the O
words. O
"It O
is O
so. O
I O
know O
all O
about O
McCarthy." O
The O
old O
man O
sank O
his O
face O
in O
his O
hands. O
"God O
help O
me!" O
he O
cried. O
"But O
I O
would O
not O
have O
let O
the O
young O
man O
come O
to O
harm. O
I O
give O
you O
my O
word O
that O
I O
would O
have O
spoken O
out O
if O
it O
went O
against O
him O
at O
the O
Assizes." O
"I O
am O
glad O
to O
hear O
you O
say O
so," O
said O
Holmes O
gravely. O
"I O
would O
have O
spoken O
now O
had O
it O
not O
been O
for O
my O
dear O
girl. O
It O
would O
break O
her O
heart-- O
it O
will O
break O
her O
heart O
when O
she O
hears O
that O
I O
am O
arrested." O
"It O
may O
not O
come O
to O
that," O
said O
Holmes. O
"What?" O
"I O
am O
no O
official O
agent. O
I O
understand O
that O
it O
was O
your O
daughter O
who O
required O
my O
presence O
here, O
and O
I O
am O
acting O
in O
her O
interests. O
Young O
McCarthy O
must O
be O
got O
off, O
however." O
"I O
am O
a O
dying O
man," O
said O
old O
Turner. O
"I O
have O
had O
diabetes O
for O
years. O
My O
doctor O
says O
it O
is O
a O
question O
whether O
I O
shall O
live O
a O
month. O
Yet O
I O
would O
rather O
die O
under O
my O
own O
roof O
than O
in O
a O
gaol." O
Holmes O
rose O
and O
sat O
down O
at O
the O
table O
with O
his O
pen O
in O
his O
hand O
and O
a O
bundle O
of O
paper O
before O
him. O
"Just O
tell O
us O
the O
truth," O
he O
said. O
"I O
shall O
jot O
down O
the O
facts. O
You O
will O
sign O
it, O
and O
Watson O
here O
can O
witness O
it. O
Then O
I O
could O
produce O
your O
confession O
at O
the O
last O
extremity O
to O
save O
young O
McCarthy. O
I O
promise O
you O
that O
I O
shall O
not O
use O
it O
unless O
it O
is O
absolutely O
needed." O
"It's O
as O
well," O
said O
the O
old O
man; O
"it's O
a O
question O
whether O
I O
shall O
live O
to O
the O
Assizes, O
so O
it O
matters O
little O
to O
me, O
but O
I O
should O
wish O
to O
spare O
Alice O
the O
shock. O
And O
now O
I O
will O
make O
the O
thing O
clear O
to O
you; O
it O
has O
been O
a O
long O
time O
in O
the O
acting, O
but O
will O
not O
take O
me O
long O
to O
tell. O
 O
You O
didn't O
know O
this O
dead O
man, O
McCarthy. O
He O
was O
a O
devil O
incarnate. O
I O
tell O
you O
that. O
God O
keep O
you O
out O
of O
the O
clutches O
of O
such O
a O
man O
as O
he. O
His O
grip O
has O
been O
upon O
me O
these O
twenty O
years, O
and O
he O
has O
blasted O
my O
life. O
I'll O
tell O
you O
first O
how O
I O
came O
to O
be O
in O
his O
power. O
 O
It O
was O
in O
the O
early O
'60's O
at O
the O
diggings. O
I O
was O
a O
young O
chap O
then, O
hot-blooded O
and O
reckless, O
ready O
to O
turn O
my O
hand O
at O
anything; O
I O
got O
among O
bad O
companions, O
took O
to O
drink, O
had O
no O
luck O
with O
my O
claim, O
took O
to O
the O
bush, O
and O
in O
a O
word O
became O
what O
you O
would O
call O
over O
here O
a O
highway O
robber. O
There O
were O
six O
of O
us, O
and O
we O
had O
a O
wild, O
free O
life O
of O
it, O
sticking O
up O
a O
station O
from O
time O
to O
time, O
or O
stopping O
the O
wagons O
on O
the O
road O
to O
the O
diggings. O
Black O
Jack O
of O
Ballarat O
was O
the O
name O
I O
went O
under, O
and O
our O
party O
is O
still O
remembered O
in O
the O
colony O
as O
the O
Ballarat O
Gang. O
 O
One O
day O
a O
gold O
convoy O
came O
down O
from O
Ballarat O
to O
Melbourne, O
and O
we O
lay O
in O
wait O
for O
it O
and O
attacked O
it. O
There O
were O
six O
troopers O
and O
six O
of O
us, O
so O
it O
was O
a O
close O
thing, O
but O
we O
emptied O
four O
of O
their O
saddles O
at O
the O
first O
volley. O
Three O
of O
our O
boys O
were O
killed, O
however, O
before O
we O
got O
the O
swag. O
I O
put O
my O
pistol O
to O
the O
head O
of O
the O
wagon-driver, O
who O
was O
this O
very O
man O
McCarthy. O
I O
wish O
to O
the O
Lord O
that O
I O
had O
shot O
him O
then, O
but O
I O
spared O
him, O
though O
I O
saw O
his O
wicked O
little O
eyes O
fixed O
on O
my O
face, O
as O
though O
to O
remember O
every O
feature. O
We O
got O
away O
with O
the O
gold, O
became O
wealthy O
men, O
and O
made O
our O
way O
over O
to O
England O
without O
being O
suspected. O
There O
I O
parted O
from O
my O
old O
pals O
and O
determined O
to O
settle O
down O
to O
a O
quiet O
and O
respectable O
life. O
I O
bought O
this O
estate, O
which O
chanced O
to O
be O
in O
the O
market, O
and O
I O
set O
myself O
to O
do O
a O
little O
good O
with O
my O
money, O
to O
make O
up O
for O
the O
way O
in O
which O
I O
had O
earned O
it. O
I O
married, O
too, O
and O
though O
my O
wife O
died O
young O
she O
left O
me O
my O
dear O
little O
Alice. O
Even O
when O
she O
was O
just O
a O
baby O
her O
wee O
hand O
seemed O
to O
lead O
me O
down O
the O
right O
path O
as O
nothing O
else O
had O
ever O
done. O
In O
a O
word, O
I O
turned O
over O
a O
new O
leaf O
and O
did O
my O
best O
to O
make O
up O
for O
the O
past. O
All O
was O
going O
well O
when O
McCarthy O
laid O
his O
grip O
upon O
me. O
 O
I O
had O
gone O
up O
to O
town O
about O
an O
investment, O
and O
I O
met O
him O
in O
Regent O
Street O
with O
hardly O
a O
coat O
to O
his O
back O
or O
a O
boot O
to O
his O
foot. O
 O
'Here O
we O
are, O
Jack,' O
says O
he, O
touching O
me O
on O
the O
arm; O
'we'll O
be O
as O
good O
as O
a O
family O
to O
you. O
There's O
two O
of O
us, O
me O
and O
my O
son, O
and O
you O
can O
have O
the O
keeping O
of O
us. O
If O
you O
don't-- O
it's O
a O
fine, O
law-abiding O
country O
is O
England, O
and O
there's O
always O
a O
policeman O
within O
hail.' O
 O
Well, O
down O
they O
came O
to O
the O
west O
country, O
there O
was O
no O
shaking O
them O
off, O
and O
there O
they O
have O
lived O
rent O
free O
on O
my O
best O
land O
ever O
since. O
There O
was O
no O
rest O
for O
me, O
no O
peace, O
no O
forgetfulness; O
turn O
where O
I O
would, O
there O
was O
his O
cunning, O
grinning O
face O
at O
my O
elbow. O
It O
grew O
worse O
as O
Alice O
grew O
up, O
for O
he O
soon O
saw O
I O
was O
more O
afraid O
of O
her O
knowing O
my O
past O
than O
of O
the O
police. O
Whatever O
he O
wanted O
he O
must O
have, O
and O
whatever O
it O
was O
I O
gave O
him O
without O
question, O
land, O
money, O
houses, O
until O
at O
last O
he O
asked O
a O
thing O
which O
I O
could O
not O
give. O
He O
asked O
for O
Alice. O
 O
His O
son, O
you O
see, O
had O
grown O
up, O
and O
so O
had O
my O
girl, O
and O
as O
I O
was O
known O
to O
be O
in O
weak O
health, O
it O
seemed O
a O
fine O
stroke O
to O
him O
that O
his O
lad O
should O
step O
into O
the O
whole O
property. O
But O
there O
I O
was O
firm. O
I O
would O
not O
have O
his O
cursed O
stock O
mixed O
with O
mine; O
not O
that O
I O
had O
any O
dislike O
to O
the O
lad, O
but O
his O
blood O
was O
in O
him, O
and O
that O
was O
enough. O
I O
stood O
firm. O
McCarthy O
threatened. O
I O
braved O
him O
to O
do O
his O
worst. O
We O
were O
to O
meet O
at O
the O
pool O
midway O
between O
our O
houses O
to O
talk O
it O
over. O
 O
When O
I O
went O
down O
there O
I O
found O
him O
talking O
with O
his O
son, O
so O
I O
smoked O
a O
cigar O
and O
waited O
behind O
a O
tree O
until O
he O
should O
be O
alone. O
But O
as O
I O
listened O
to O
his O
talk O
all O
that O
was O
black O
and O
bitter O
in O
me O
seemed O
to O
come O
uppermost. O
He O
was O
urging O
his O
son O
to O
marry O
my O
daughter O
with O
as O
little O
regard O
for O
what O
she O
might O
think O
as O
if O
she O
were O
a O
slut O
from O
off O
the O
streets. O
It O
drove O
me O
mad O
to O
think O
that O
I O
and O
all O
that O
I O
held O
most O
dear O
should O
be O
in O
the O
power O
of O
such O
a O
man O
as O
this. O
Could O
I O
not O
snap O
the O
bond? O
I O
was O
already O
a O
dying O
and O
a O
desperate O
man. O
Though O
clear O
of O
mind O
and O
fairly O
strong O
of O
limb, O
I O
knew O
that O
my O
own O
fate O
was O
sealed. O
But O
my O
memory O
and O
my O
girl! O
Both O
could O
be O
saved O
if O
I O
could O
but O
silence O
that O
foul O
tongue. O
I O
did O
it, O
Mr. O
Holmes. O
I O
would O
do O
it O
again. O
Deeply O
as O
I O
have O
sinned, O
I O
have O
led O
a O
life O
of O
martyrdom O
to O
atone O
for O
it. O
But O
that O
my O
girl O
should O
be O
entangled O
in O
the O
same O
meshes O
which O
held O
me O
was O
more O
than O
I O
could O
suffer. O
I O
struck O
him O
down O
with O
no O
more O
compunction O
than O
if O
he O
had O
been O
some O
foul O
and O
venomous O
beast. O
His O
cry O
brought O
back O
his O
son; O
but O
I O
had O
gained O
the O
cover O
of O
the O
wood, O
though O
I O
was O
forced O
to O
go O
back O
to O
fetch O
the O
cloak O
which O
I O
had O
dropped O
in O
my O
flight. O
That O
is O
the O
true O
story, O
gentlemen, O
of O
all O
that O
occurred." O
"Well, O
it O
is O
not O
for O
me O
to O
judge O
you," O
said O
Holmes O
as O
the O
old O
man O
signed O
the O
statement O
which O
had O
been O
drawn O
out. O
"I O
pray O
that O
we O
may O
never O
be O
exposed O
to O
such O
a O
temptation." O
"I O
pray O
not, O
sir. O
And O
what O
do O
you O
intend O
to O
do?" O
"In O
view O
of O
your O
health, O
nothing. O
You O
are O
yourself O
aware O
that O
you O
will O
soon O
have O
to O
answer O
for O
your O
deed O
at O
a O
higher O
court O
than O
the O
Assizes. O
I O
will O
keep O
your O
confession, O
and O
if O
McCarthy O
is O
condemned O
I O
shall O
be O
forced O
to O
use O
it. O
If O
not, O
it O
shall O
never O
be O
seen O
by O
mortal O
eye; O
and O
your O
secret, O
whether O
you O
be O
alive O
or O
dead, O
shall O
be O
safe O
with O
us." O
"Farewell, O
then," O
said O
the O
old O
man O
solemnly. O
"Your O
own O
deathbeds, O
when O
they O
come, O
will O
be O
the O
easier O
for O
the O
thought O
of O
the O
peace O
which O
you O
have O
given O
to O
mine." O
Tottering O
and O
shaking O
in O
all O
his O
giant O
frame, O
he O
stumbled O
slowly O
from O
the O
room. O
"God O
help O
us!" O
said O
Holmes O
after O
a O
long O
silence. O
"Why O
does O
fate O
play O
such O
tricks O
with O
poor, O
helpless O
worms? O
I O
never O
hear O
of O
such O
a O
case O
as O
this O
that O
I O
do O
not O
think O
of O
Baxter's O
words, O
and O
say, O
'There, O
but O
for O
the O
grace O
of O
God, O
goes O
Sherlock O
Holmes.'" O
James O
McCarthy O
was O
acquitted O
at O
the O
Assizes O
on O
the O
strength O
of O
a O
number O
of O
objections O
which O
had O
been O
drawn O
out O
by O
Holmes O
and O
submitted O
to O
the O
defending O
counsel. O
Old O
Turner O
lived O
for O
seven O
months O
after O
our O
interview, O
but O
he O
is O
now O
dead; O
and O
there O
is O
every O
prospect O
that O
the O
son O

may O
come O

happily O
together O
in O

the O

"My Quotation

"And Quotation

"The Quotation

"Indeed, Quotation
your Quotation

an Quotation
unfortunate Quotation
one Quotation
for Quotation

taking O
the O

glancing O
his O

down O
it. O
"This Quotation

the Quotation

I Quotation

some Quotation
small Quotation

The Quotation

out O
his O

of O
old O
gold, O
with O
a O
great O
amethyst O
in O
the O

"Ah," Quotation

he, Entity
"I Quotation
forgot Quotation

the Quotation

I Entity
asked, Cue
glancing O
at O
a O
remarkable O
brilliant O
which O
sparkled O
upon O
his O
finger. O
"It Quotation
was Quotation
from Quotation
the Quotation
reigning Quotation
family Quotation
of Quotation
Holland, Quotation
though Quotation
the Quotation
matter Quotation
in Quotation
which Quotation
I Quotation
served Quotation
them Quotation
was Quotation
of Quotation
such Quotation
delicacy Quotation
that Quotation
I Quotation
cannot Quotation
confide Quotation
it Quotation
even Quotation
to Quotation
you, Quotation
who Quotation
have Quotation
been Quotation
good Quotation
enough Quotation
to Quotation
chronicle Quotation
one Quotation

two Quotation

my Quotation
little Quotation
problems." Quotation
"And Quotation
have Quotation
you Quotation
any Quotation
on Quotation

just Quotation
now?" Quotation
I Entity
asked Cue
with O
interest. O
"Some Quotation
ten Quotation
or Quotation
twelve, Quotation
but Quotation
none Quotation
which Quotation
present Quotation
any Quotation
feature Quotation
of Quotation
interest. Quotation
They Quotation
are Quotation
important, Quotation
you Quotation
understand, Quotation
without Quotation
being Quotation
interesting. Quotation
Indeed, Quotation
I Quotation
have Quotation
found Quotation
that Quotation
it Quotation
is Quotation
usually Quotation
in Quotation
unimportant Quotation
matters Quotation
that Quotation
there Quotation
is Quotation
a Quotation
field Quotation
for Quotation
the Quotation
observation, Quotation
and Quotation
for Quotation
the Quotation
quick Quotation
analysis Quotation
of Quotation
cause Quotation

effect Quotation
which Quotation
gives Quotation
the Quotation
charm Quotation
to Quotation
an Quotation
investigation. Quotation
The Quotation
larger Quotation
crimes Quotation
are Quotation
apt Quotation
to Quotation
be Quotation
the Quotation
simpler, Quotation
for Quotation
the Quotation
bigger Quotation
the Quotation
crime Quotation
the Quotation
more Quotation
obvious, Quotation
as Quotation
a Quotation
rule, Quotation
is Quotation
the Quotation
motive. Quotation
In Quotation
these Quotation
cases, Quotation
save Quotation
for Quotation
one Quotation
rather Quotation
intricate Quotation
matter Quotation
which Quotation
has Quotation
been Quotation
referred Quotation
to Quotation
me Quotation
from Quotation
Marseilles, Quotation
there Quotation
is Quotation
nothing Quotation
which Quotation
presents Quotation
any Quotation
features Quotation
of Quotation
interest. Quotation
It Quotation
is Quotation
possible, Quotation
however, Quotation
that Quotation
I Quotation
may Quotation
have Quotation
something Quotation
better Quotation
before Quotation
very Quotation
many Quotation
minutes Quotation
are Quotation
over, Quotation
for Quotation
this Quotation

one Quotation

my Quotation

I Quotation

much Quotation
mistaken." Quotation
He O
had O
risen O
from O
his O
chair O
and O
was O
standing O
between O
the O
parted O
blinds O
gazing O
down O
into O
the O
dull O
neutral-tinted O
London O
street. O
Looking O
over O
his O
shoulder, O
I Entity
saw O
that O
on O
the O
pavement O
opposite O
there O
stood O
a O
large O
woman O
with O
a O
heavy O
fur O
boa O
round O
her O
neck, O
and O
a O
large O
curling O
red O
feather O
in O
a O
broad-brimmed O
hat O
which O
was O
tilted O
in O
a O
coquettish O
Duchess O
of O
Devonshire O
fashion O
over O
her O
ear. O
From O
under O
this O
great O
panoply O
she O
peeped O
up O
in O
a O
nervous, O
hesitating O
fashion O
at O
our O
windows, O
while O
her O
body O
oscillated O
backward O
and O
forward, O
and O
her O
fingers O
fidgeted O
with O
her O
glove O
buttons. O
Suddenly, O
with O
a O
plunge, O
as O
of O
the O
swimmer O
who O
leaves O
the O
bank, O
she O
hurried O
across O
the O
road, O
and O
we O
heard O
the O
sharp O
clang O
of O
the O
bell. O
"I Quotation
have Quotation
seen Quotation
those Quotation
symptoms Quotation
before," Quotation
said Cue
Holmes, Entity
throwing O
his O
cigarette O
into O
the O
fire. O
"Oscillation Quotation
upon Quotation
the Quotation
pavement Quotation
always Quotation
means Quotation
an Quotation
affaire Quotation
de Quotation
coeur. Quotation
She Quotation
would Quotation
like Quotation
advice, Quotation
but Quotation
is Quotation
not Quotation
sure Quotation
that Quotation
the Quotation
matter Quotation
is Quotation
not Quotation
too Quotation
delicate Quotation
for Quotation
communication. Quotation
And Quotation
yet Quotation
even Quotation
here Quotation
we Quotation
may Quotation
discriminate. Quotation
When Quotation
a Quotation
woman Quotation
has Quotation
been Quotation
seriously Quotation
wronged Quotation
by Quotation
a Quotation
man Quotation
she Quotation
no Quotation
longer Quotation
oscillates, Quotation
and Quotation
the Quotation
usual Quotation
symptom Quotation
is Quotation
a Quotation
broken Quotation
bell Quotation
wire. Quotation
Here Quotation
we Quotation
may Quotation
take Quotation
it Quotation
that Quotation
there Quotation
is Quotation
a Quotation
love Quotation
matter, Quotation
but Quotation
that Quotation
the Quotation
maiden Quotation
is Quotation
not Quotation
so Quotation
much Quotation
angry Quotation
as Quotation
perplexed, Quotation
or Quotation
grieved. Quotation
But Quotation
here Quotation
she Quotation
comes Quotation
in Quotation
person Quotation
to Quotation
resolve Quotation
our Quotation
doubts." Quotation
As O
he O
spoke O
there O
was O
a O
tap O
at O
the O
door, O
and O
the O
boy O
in O
buttons O
entered O
to O
announce O
Miss O
Mary O
Sutherland, O
while O
the O
lady O
herself O
loomed O
behind O
his O
small O
black O
figure O
like O
a O
full-sailed O
merchant-man O
behind O
a O
tiny O
pilot O
boat. O
Sherlock O
Holmes O
welcomed O
her Entity
with O
the O
easy O
courtesy O
for O
which O
he O
was O
remarkable, O
and, O
having O
closed O
the O
door O
and O
bowed O
her O
into O
an O
armchair, O
he O
looked O
her O
over O
in O
the O
minute O
and O
yet O
abstracted O
fashion O
which O
was O
peculiar O
to O
him. O
"Do Quotation
you Quotation
not Quotation
find," Quotation
he Entity
said, Cue
"that Quotation
with Quotation
your Quotation
short Quotation

much Quotation
typewriting?" Quotation
"I Quotation
did Quotation
at Quotation
first," Quotation
she Entity
answered, Cue
"but Quotation
now Quotation
I Quotation
know Quotation
where Quotation
the Quotation
letters Quotation
are Quotation
without Quotation
looking." Quotation
Then, O
suddenly O
realising O
the O
full O
purport O
of O
his O
words, O
she O
gave O
a O
violent O
start O
and O
looked O
up, O
with O
fear O
and O
astonishment O
upon O
her O
broad, O
good-humoured O
face. O
"You've Quotation
heard Quotation
about Quotation
me, Quotation
Mr. Quotation
Holmes," Quotation
she Entity
cried, Cue
"else Quotation
how Quotation
could Quotation
you Quotation
know Quotation
all Quotation
that?" Quotation
"Never Quotation
mind," Quotation
said Cue
Holmes, Entity
laughing; O
"it Quotation
is Quotation
my Quotation
business Quotation
to Quotation
know Quotation
things. Quotation
Perhaps Quotation
I Quotation
have Quotation
trained Quotation
myself Quotation

see Quotation
what Quotation
others Quotation
overlook. Quotation
If Quotation
not, Quotation
why Quotation
should Quotation
you Quotation
come Quotation

me?" Quotation
"I Quotation
came Quotation
to Quotation
you, Quotation

Oh, Quotation
Mr. Quotation

the Quotation
little Quotation
that Quotation
I Quotation
make Quotation
by Quotation
the Quotation
machine, Quotation
and Quotation
I Quotation
would Quotation
give Quotation
it Quotation
all Quotation
to Quotation
know Quotation
what Quotation
has Quotation
become Quotation
of Quotation
Mr. Quotation
Hosmer Quotation
Angel." Quotation
"Why Quotation
did Quotation
you Quotation
come Quotation
away Quotation
to Quotation
consult Quotation
me Quotation
in Quotation
such Quotation
a Quotation
hurry?" Quotation
asked Cue
Sherlock Entity
Holmes, Entity
with O
his O
finger-tips O
together O
and O
his O
eyes O
to O
the O
ceiling. O
Again O
a O
startled O
look O
came O
over O
the O
somewhat O
vacuous O
face O
of O
Miss O
Mary O
Sutherland. O
"Yes, Quotation
I Quotation
did Quotation
bang Quotation
out Quotation
of Quotation
the Quotation
house," Quotation
she Entity
said, Cue
"for Quotation
it Quotation
made Quotation
me Quotation
angry Quotation
to Quotation
see Quotation
the Quotation
easy Quotation
way Quotation
in Quotation
which Quotation
Mr. Quotation
Windibank-- Quotation
that Quotation
is, Quotation
my Quotation
father-- Quotation
took Quotation
it Quotation
all. Quotation
He Quotation
would Quotation
not Quotation
go Quotation
to Quotation
the Quotation
police, Quotation
and Quotation
he Quotation
would Quotation
not Quotation
go Quotation
to Quotation
you, Quotation

so Quotation
at Quotation
last, Quotation
as Quotation
he Quotation
would Quotation
do Quotation
nothing Quotation
and Quotation
kept Quotation
on Quotation
saying Quotation
that Quotation
there Quotation
was Quotation
no Quotation
harm Quotation
done, Quotation
it Quotation
made Quotation
me Quotation
mad, Quotation

I Quotation
just Quotation
on Quotation
with Quotation
my Quotation
things Quotation

came Quotation
right Quotation
away Quotation
to Quotation
you." Quotation
"Your Quotation
father," Quotation
said Cue
Holmes, Entity
"your Quotation
stepfather, Quotation
surely, Quotation
since Quotation
the Quotation
name Quotation
is Quotation
different." Quotation
"Yes, Quotation
my Quotation
stepfather. Quotation
I Quotation
call Quotation
him Quotation
father, Quotation
though Quotation
it Quotation
sounds Quotation
funny, Quotation
too, Quotation
for Quotation
he Quotation
is Quotation
only Quotation
five Quotation
years Quotation
and Quotation
two Quotation
months Quotation
older Quotation

myself." Quotation
"And Quotation
your Quotation
mother Quotation
is Quotation
alive?" Quotation
"Oh, Quotation
yes, Quotation
mother Quotation
is Quotation
alive Quotation
and Quotation
well. Quotation
I Quotation
wasn't Quotation
best Quotation

Mr. Quotation
Holmes, Quotation
when Quotation
she Quotation
married Quotation
again Quotation
so Quotation
soon Quotation
after Quotation
father's Quotation
death, Quotation
and Quotation
a Quotation
man Quotation
who Quotation
was Quotation
nearly Quotation
fifteen Quotation
years Quotation
younger Quotation

Father Quotation
was Quotation
a Quotation
plumber Quotation
in Quotation
the Quotation
Tottenham Quotation

he Quotation
left Quotation

behind Quotation
him, Quotation
which Quotation
mother Quotation
carried Quotation
on Quotation
with Quotation
Mr. Quotation

when Quotation
Mr. Quotation
Windibank Quotation
came Quotation
he Quotation
made Quotation
her Quotation
sell Quotation
the Quotation
business, Quotation
for Quotation
he Quotation
was Quotation
very Quotation
superior, Quotation
being Quotation
a Quotation
traveller Quotation
in Quotation
wines. Quotation
They Quotation
got Quotation
4700 Quotation

for Quotation
the Quotation
goodwill Quotation

near Quotation

much Quotation

Sherlock O

impatient O
under O
this O
rambling O

on O

"Your Quotation
own Quotation
little Quotation
income," Quotation
he Entity
asked, Cue
"does Quotation
it Quotation

out Quotation
of Quotation
the Quotation

"Oh, Quotation
no, Quotation
sir. Quotation
It Quotation

quite Quotation

Auckland. Quotation

Two Quotation

I Quotation
can Quotation
only Quotation

the Quotation

"You Quotation

me Quotation
extremely," Quotation

Holmes. Entity
"And Quotation
since Quotation
you Quotation
draw Quotation
so Quotation
large Quotation
a Quotation

as Quotation
a Quotation

a Quotation

with Quotation
what Quotation
you Quotation
earn Quotation
into Quotation
the Quotation
bargain, Quotation
you Quotation
no Quotation
doubt Quotation
travel Quotation
a Quotation
little Quotation
and Quotation
indulge Quotation
yourself Quotation
in Quotation
every Quotation
way. Quotation
I Quotation
believe Quotation
that Quotation
a Quotation

lady Quotation
can Quotation
get Quotation
on Quotation
very Quotation
nicely Quotation
upon Quotation
an Quotation
income Quotation
of Quotation

60 Quotation
pounds." Quotation
"I Quotation
could Quotation
do Quotation
with Quotation
much Quotation
less Quotation

that, Quotation
Mr. Quotation
Holmes, Quotation
but Quotation
you Quotation
understand Quotation
that Quotation
as Quotation
long Quotation
as Quotation
I Quotation
live Quotation
at Quotation
home Quotation
I Quotation
don't Quotation
wish Quotation

a Quotation

so Quotation
they Quotation
have Quotation
the Quotation

of Quotation
the Quotation

just Quotation
while Quotation
I Quotation
am Quotation
staying Quotation
with Quotation
them. Quotation
Of Quotation
course, Quotation
that Quotation
is Quotation
only Quotation
just Quotation
for Quotation
the Quotation

Mr. Quotation
Windibank Quotation
draws Quotation
my Quotation
interest Quotation
every Quotation
quarter Quotation

pays Quotation
it Quotation
over Quotation
to Quotation
mother, Quotation

I Quotation
find Quotation
that Quotation
I Quotation
can Quotation
do Quotation
pretty Quotation
well Quotation
with Quotation
what Quotation
I Quotation

at Quotation
typewriting. Quotation
It Quotation

I Quotation

twenty Quotation

a Quotation
day." Quotation
"You Quotation

very Quotation
clear Quotation

then Quotation
afterwards Quotation
they Quotation

us, Quotation

sent Quotation
them Quotation
to Quotation

Mr. Quotation
Windibank Quotation
did Quotation
not Quotation
wish Quotation
us Quotation
to Quotation
go. Quotation
He Quotation
never Quotation
did Quotation
wish Quotation
us Quotation
to Quotation
go Quotation
anywhere. Quotation
He Quotation
would Quotation
get Quotation
quite Quotation
mad Quotation
if Quotation
I Quotation
wanted Quotation
so Quotation
much Quotation
as Quotation
to Quotation
join Quotation
a Quotation
Sunday-school Quotation
treat. Quotation
But Quotation
this Quotation
time Quotation
I Quotation
was Quotation
set Quotation
on Quotation
going, Quotation
and Quotation
I Quotation
would Quotation
go; Quotation
for Quotation
what Quotation
right Quotation
had Quotation
he Quotation
to Quotation
prevent? Quotation
He Quotation
said Quotation
the Quotation

were Quotation
not Quotation

know, Quotation
when Quotation
all Quotation
father's Quotation

there. Quotation
And Quotation
he Quotation
said Quotation
that Quotation
I Quotation
had Quotation
nothing Quotation
fit Quotation

wear, Quotation
when Quotation
I Quotation
had Quotation
my Quotation
purple Quotation
plush Quotation
that Quotation
I Quotation
had Quotation
never Quotation
so Quotation
much Quotation
as Quotation
taken Quotation
out Quotation
of Quotation
the Quotation

At Quotation
last, Quotation
when Quotation
nothing Quotation

he Quotation
went Quotation
off Quotation

France Quotation
upon Quotation
the Quotation

we Quotation

I, Quotation

Mr. Quotation

who Quotation
used Quotation

our Quotation
foreman, Quotation

it Quotation

there Quotation
I Quotation

suppose," Quotation

Holmes, Entity
"that Quotation
when Quotation
Mr. Quotation
Windibank Quotation
came Quotation
back Quotation

France Quotation
he Quotation

your Quotation

"Oh, Quotation
well, Quotation
he Quotation
was Quotation
very Quotation
good Quotation
about Quotation
it. Quotation
He Quotation
laughed, Quotation
I Quotation
remember, Quotation

shrugged Quotation
his Quotation
shoulders, Quotation

said Quotation
there Quotation

no Quotation

Then Quotation
at Quotation
the Quotation
gasfitters' Quotation
ball Quotation
you Quotation
met, Quotation
as Quotation
I Quotation

a Quotation

called Quotation
Mr. Quotation

"Yes, Quotation
sir. Quotation
I Quotation
met Quotation
him Quotation
that Quotation
night, Quotation

he Quotation
called Quotation
next Quotation
day Quotation
to Quotation
ask Quotation
if Quotation
we Quotation
had Quotation
got Quotation
home Quotation
all Quotation
safe, Quotation

after Quotation
that Quotation
we Quotation
met Quotation
him-- Quotation
that Quotation
is Quotation
to Quotation
say, Quotation
Mr. Quotation
Holmes, Quotation
I Quotation
met Quotation
him Quotation
twice Quotation
for Quotation
walks, Quotation
but Quotation
after Quotation
that Quotation
father Quotation
came Quotation
back Quotation
again, Quotation
and Quotation
Mr. Quotation
Hosmer Quotation
Angel Quotation
could Quotation
not Quotation
come Quotation
to Quotation
the Quotation
house Quotation
any Quotation
more." Quotation
"No?" Quotation
"Well, Quotation
you Quotation
know Quotation
father Quotation
didn't Quotation
like Quotation
anything Quotation
of Quotation
the Quotation
sort. Quotation
He Quotation
wouldn't Quotation
have Quotation
any Quotation
visitors Quotation
if Quotation
he Quotation
could Quotation
help Quotation
it, Quotation
and Quotation
he Quotation
used Quotation
to Quotation
say Quotation
that Quotation
a Quotation
woman Quotation
should Quotation
be Quotation
happy Quotation
in Quotation
her Quotation
own Quotation
family Quotation
circle. Quotation
But Quotation
then, Quotation
as Quotation
I Quotation
used Quotation
to Quotation
say Quotation
to Quotation
mother, Quotation
a Quotation
woman Quotation
wants Quotation
her Quotation
own Quotation
circle Quotation
to Quotation
begin Quotation
with, Quotation
and Quotation
I Quotation
had Quotation
not Quotation

mine Quotation
yet." Quotation
"But Quotation
how Quotation
about Quotation
Mr. Quotation
Hosmer Quotation
Angel? Quotation
Did Quotation
he Quotation
make Quotation
no Quotation
attempt Quotation
to Quotation
see Quotation
you?" Quotation
"Well, Quotation
father Quotation
was Quotation
going Quotation
off Quotation
to Quotation
France Quotation
again Quotation
in Quotation
a Quotation
week, Quotation
and Quotation
Hosmer Quotation
wrote Quotation
and Quotation
said Quotation
that Quotation
it Quotation
would Quotation
be Quotation
safer Quotation
and Quotation
better Quotation
not Quotation
to Quotation
see Quotation
each Quotation
other Quotation
until Quotation
he Quotation
had Quotation
gone. Quotation
We Quotation
could Quotation
write Quotation
in Quotation
the Quotation
meantime, Quotation
and Quotation
he Quotation
used Quotation
to Quotation
write Quotation
every Quotation
day. Quotation
I Quotation
took Quotation
the Quotation
letters Quotation
in Quotation
in Quotation
the Quotation
morning, Quotation
so Quotation
there Quotation
was Quotation
no Quotation
need Quotation
for Quotation
father Quotation

"Were Quotation
you Quotation
engaged Quotation
to Quotation
the Quotation
gentleman Quotation
at Quotation
this Quotation
time?" Quotation
"Oh, Quotation
yes, Quotation
Mr. Quotation
Holmes. Quotation
We Quotation
were Quotation
engaged Quotation
after Quotation
the Quotation
first Quotation
walk Quotation
that Quotation
we Quotation
took. Quotation
Hosmer-- Quotation
Mr. Quotation
Angel-- Quotation
was Quotation
a Quotation
cashier Quotation
in Quotation
an Quotation
office Quotation
in Quotation
Leadenhall Quotation
Street-- Quotation
and--" Quotation
"What Quotation
office?" Quotation
"That's Quotation
the Quotation
worst Quotation
of Quotation
it, Quotation
Mr. Quotation
Holmes, Quotation
I Quotation
don't Quotation
know." Quotation
"Where Quotation
did Quotation
he Quotation
live, Quotation
then?" Quotation
"He Quotation
slept Quotation
on Quotation
the Quotation
premises." Quotation
"And Quotation
you Quotation
don't Quotation
know Quotation
his Quotation
address?" Quotation
"No-- Quotation
except Quotation
that Quotation
it Quotation
was Quotation
Leadenhall Quotation
Street." Quotation
"Where Quotation
did Quotation
you Quotation
address Quotation
your Quotation
letters, Quotation
then?" Quotation
"To Quotation
the Quotation
Leadenhall Quotation
Street Quotation
Post Quotation
Office, Quotation
to Quotation

called Quotation

He Quotation
said Quotation
that Quotation
if Quotation

sent Quotation

the Quotation

he Quotation
would Quotation
be Quotation
chaffed Quotation
by Quotation
all Quotation
the Quotation
other Quotation
clerks Quotation
about Quotation
having Quotation
letters Quotation
from Quotation
a Quotation
lady, Quotation
so Quotation
I Quotation
offered Quotation
to Quotation
typewrite Quotation
them, Quotation
like Quotation
he Quotation
did Quotation
his, Quotation
but Quotation
he Quotation
wouldn't Quotation
have Quotation
that, Quotation
for Quotation
he Quotation
said Quotation
that Quotation
when Quotation
I Quotation
wrote Quotation
them Quotation
they Quotation
seemed Quotation
to Quotation
come Quotation
from Quotation
me, Quotation
but Quotation
when Quotation
they Quotation
were Quotation
typewritten Quotation
he Quotation
always Quotation
felt Quotation
that Quotation
the Quotation
machine Quotation
had Quotation
come Quotation
between Quotation
us. Quotation
That Quotation
will Quotation
just Quotation
show Quotation
you Quotation
how Quotation
fond Quotation
he Quotation
was Quotation
of Quotation
me, Quotation
Mr. Quotation
Holmes, Quotation
and Quotation
the Quotation
little Quotation
things Quotation
that Quotation
he Quotation
would Quotation
think Quotation
of." Quotation
"It O
was O
most O
suggestive," O
said O
Holmes. O
"It O
has O
long O
been O
an O
axiom O
of O
mine O
that O
the O
little O
things O
are O
infinitely O
the O
most O
important. O
Can O
you O
remember O
any O
other O
little O
things O
about O
Mr. O
Hosmer O
Angel?" O
"He O
was O
a O
very O
shy O
man, O
Mr. O
Holmes. O
He O
would O
rather O
walk O
with O
me O
in O
the O
evening O
than O
in O
the O
daylight, O
for O
he O
said O
that O
he O
hated O
to O
be O
conspicuous. O
Very O
retiring O
and O
gentlemanly O
he O
was. O
Even O
his O
voice O
was O
gentle. O
He'd O
had O
the O
quinsy O
and O
swollen O
glands O
when O
he O
was O
young, O
he O
told O
me, O
and O
it O
had O
left O
him O
with O
a O
weak O
throat, O
and O
a O
hesitating, O
whispering O
fashion O
of O
speech. O
He O
was O
always O
well O
dressed, O
very O
neat O
and O
plain, O
but O
his O
eyes O
were O
weak, O
just O
as O
mine O
are, O
and O
he O
wore O
tinted O
glasses O
against O
the O
glare." O
"Well, O
and O
what O
happened O
when O
Mr. O
Windibank, O
your O
stepfather, O
returned O
to O
France?" O
"Mr. O
Hosmer O
Angel O
came O
to O
the O
house O
again O
and O
proposed O
that O
we O
should O
marry O
before O
father O
came O
back. O
He O
was O
in O
dreadful O
earnest O
and O
made O
me O
swear, O
with O
my O
hands O
on O
the O
Testament, O
that O
whatever O
happened O
I O
would O
always O
be O
true O
to O
him. O
Mother O
said O
he O
was O
quite O
right O
to O
make O
me O
swear, O
and O
that O
it O
was O
a O
sign O
of O
his O
passion. O
Mother O
was O
all O
in O
his O
favour O
from O
the O
first O
and O
was O
even O
fonder O
of O
him O
than O
I O
was. O
Then, O
when O
they O
talked O
of O
marrying O
within O
the O
week, O
I O
began O
to O
ask O
about O
father; O
but O
they O
both O
said O
never O
to O
mind O
about O
father, O
but O
just O
to O
tell O
him O
afterwards, O
and O
mother O
said O
she O
would O
make O
it O
all O
right O
with O
him. O
I O
didn't O
quite O
like O
that, O
Mr. O
Holmes. O
It O
seemed O
funny O
that O
I O
should O
ask O
his O
leave, O
as O
he O
was O
only O
a O
few O
years O
older O
than O
me; O
but O
I O
didn't O
want O
to O
do O
anything O
on O
the O
sly, O
so O
I O
wrote O
to O
father O
at O
Bordeaux, O
where O
the O
company O
has O
its O
French O
offices, O
but O
the O
letter O
came O
back O
to O
me O
on O
the O
very O
morning O
of O
the O
wedding." O
"It O
missed O
him, O
then?" O
"Yes, O
sir; O
for O
he O
had O
started O
to O
England O
just O
before O
it O
arrived." O
"Ha! O
that O
was O
unfortunate. O
Your O
wedding O
was O
arranged, O
then, O
for O
the O
Friday. O
Was O
it O
to O
be O
in O
church?" O
"Yes, O
sir, O
but O
very O
quietly. O
It O
was O
to O
be O
at O
St. O
Saviour's, O
near O
King's O
Cross, O
and O
we O
were O
to O
have O
breakfast O
afterwards O
at O
the O
St. O
Pancras O
Hotel. O
Hosmer O
came O
for O
us O
in O
a O
hansom, O
but O
as O
there O
were O
two O
of O
us O
he O
put O
us O
both O
into O
it O
and O
stepped O
himself O
into O
a O
four-wheeler, O
which O
happened O
to O
be O
the O
only O
other O
cab O
in O
the O
street. O
We O
got O
to O
the O
church O
first, O
and O
when O
the O
four-wheeler O
drove O
up O
we O
waited O
for O
him O
to O
step O
out, O
but O
he O
never O
did, O
and O
when O
the O
cabman O
got O
down O
from O
the O
box O
and O
looked O
there O
was O
no O
one O
there! O
The O
cabman O
said O
that O
he O
could O
not O
imagine O
what O
had O
become O
of O
him, O
for O
he O
had O
seen O
him O
get O
in O
with O
his O
own O
eyes. O
That O
was O
last O
Friday, O
Mr. O
Holmes, O
and O
I O
have O
never O
seen O
or O
heard O
anything O
since O
then O
to O
throw O
any O
light O
upon O
what O
became O
of O
him." O
"It O
seems O
to O
me O
that O
you O
have O
been O
very O
shamefully O
treated," O
said O
Holmes. O
"Oh, O
no, O
sir! O
He O
was O
too O
good O
and O
kind O
to O
leave O
me O
so. O
Why, O
all O
the O
morning O
he O
was O
saying O
to O
me O
that, O
whatever O
happened, O
I O
was O
to O
be O
true; O
and O
that O
even O
if O
something O
quite O
unforeseen O
occurred O
to O
separate O
us, O
I O
was O
always O
to O
remember O
that O
I O
was O
pledged O
to O
him, O
and O
that O
he O
would O
claim O
his O
pledge O
sooner O
or O
later. O
It O
seemed O
strange O
talk O
for O
a O
wedding-morning, O
but O
what O
has O
happened O
since O
gives O
a O
meaning O
to O
it." O
"Most O
certainly O
it O
does. O
Your O
own O
opinion O
is, O
then, O
that O
some O
unforeseen O
catastrophe O
has O
occurred O
to O
him?" O
"Yes, O
sir. O
I O
believe O
that O
he O
foresaw O
some O
danger, O
or O
else O
he O
would O
not O
have O
talked O
so. O
And O
then O
I O
think O
that O
what O
he O
foresaw O
happened." O
"But O
you O
have O
no O
notion O
as O
to O
what O
it O
could O
have O
been?" O
"None." O
"One O
more O
question. O
How O
did O
your O
mother O
take O
the O
matter?" O
"She O
was O
angry, O
and O
said O
that O
I O
was O
never O
to O
speak O
of O
the O
matter O
again." O
"And O
your O
father? O
Did O
you O
tell O
him?" O
"Yes; O
and O
he O
seemed O
to O
think, O
with O
me, O
that O
something O
had O
happened, O
and O
that O
I O
should O
hear O
of O
Hosmer O
again. O
As O
he O
said, O
what O
interest O
could O
anyone O
have O
in O
bringing O
me O
to O
the O
doors O
of O
the O
church, O
and O
then O
leaving O
me? O
Now, O
if O
he O
had O
borrowed O
my O
money, O
or O
if O
he O
had O
married O
me O
and O
got O
my O
money O
settled O
on O
him, O
there O
might O
be O
some O
reason, O
but O
Hosmer O
was O
very O
independent O
about O
money O
and O
never O
would O
look O
at O
a O
shilling O
of O
mine. O
And O
yet, O
what O
could O
have O
happened? O
And O
why O
could O
he O
not O
write? O
Oh, O
it O
drives O
me O
half-mad O
to O
think O
of O
it, O
and O
I O
can't O
sleep O
a O
wink O
at O
night." O
She O
pulled O
a O
little O
handkerchief O
out O
of O
her O
muff O
and O
began O
to O
sob O
heavily O
into O
it. O
"I O
shall O
glance O
into O
the O
case O
for O
you," O
said O
Holmes, O
rising, O
"and O
I O
have O
no O
doubt O
that O
we O
shall O
reach O
some O
definite O
result. O
Let O
the O
weight O
of O
the O
matter O
rest O
upon O
me O
now, O
and O
do O
not O
let O
your O
mind O
dwell O
upon O
it O
further. O
Above O
all, O
try O
to O
let O
Mr. O
Hosmer O
Angel O
vanish O
from O
your O
memory, O
as O
he O
has O
done O
from O
your O
life." O
"Then O
you O
don't O
think O
I'll O
see O
him O
again?" O
"I O
fear O
not." O
"Then O
what O
has O
happened O
to O
him?" O
"You O
will O
leave O
that O
question O
in O
my O
hands. O
I O
should O
like O
an O
accurate O
description O
of O
him O
and O
any O
letters O
of O
his O
which O
you O
can O
spare." O
"I O
advertised O
for O
him O
in O
last O
Saturday's O
Chronicle," O
said O
she. O
"Here O
is O
the O
slip O
and O
here O
are O
four O
letters O
from O
him." O
"Thank O
you. O
And O
your O
address?" O
"No. O
31 O
Lyon O
Place, O
Camberwell." O
"Mr. O
Angel's O
address O
you O
never O
had, O
I O
understand. O
Where O
is O
your O
father's O
place O
of O
business?" O
"He O
travels O
for O
Westhouse O
& O
Marbank, O
the O
great O
claret O
importers O
of O
Fenchurch O
Street." O
"Thank O
you. O
You O
have O
made O
your O
statement O
very O
clearly. O
You O
will O
leave O
the O
papers O
here, O
and O
remember O
the O
advice O
which O
I O
have O
given O
you. O
Let O
the O
whole O
incident O
be O
a O
sealed O
book, O
and O
do O
not O
allow O
it O
to O
affect O
your O
life." O
"You O
are O
very O
kind, O
Mr. O
Holmes, O
but O
I O
cannot O
do O
that. O
I O
shall O
be O
true O
to O
Hosmer. O
He O
shall O
find O
me O
ready O
when O
he O
comes O
back." O
For O
all O
the O
preposterous O
hat O
and O
the O
vacuous O
face, O
there O
was O
something O
noble O
in O
the O
simple O
faith O
of O
our O
visitor O
which O
compelled O
our O
respect. O
She O
laid O
her O
little O
bundle O
of O
papers O
upon O
the O
table O
and O
went O
her O
way, O
with O
a O
promise O
to O
come O
again O
whenever O
she O
might O
be O
summoned. O
Sherlock O
Holmes O
sat O
silent O
for O
a O
few O
minutes O
with O
his O
fingertips O
still O
pressed O
together, O
his O
legs O
stretched O
out O
in O
front O
of O
him, O
and O
his O
gaze O
directed O
upward O
to O
the O
ceiling. O
Then O
he O
took O
down O
from O
the O
rack O
the O
old O
and O
oily O
clay O
pipe, O
which O
was O
to O
him O
as O
a O
counsellor, O
and, O
having O
lit O
it, O
he O
leaned O
back O
in O
his O
chair, O
with O
the O
thick O
blue O
cloud-wreaths O
spinning O
up O
from O
him, O
and O
a O
look O
of O
infinite O
languor O
in O
his O
face. O
"Quite O
an O
interesting O
study, O
that O
maiden," O
he O
observed. O
"I O
found O
her O
more O
interesting O
than O
her O
little O
problem, O
which, O
by O
the O
way, O
is O
rather O
a O
trite O
one. O
You O
will O
find O
parallel O
cases, O
if O
you O
consult O
my O
index, O
in O
Andover O
in O
'77, O
and O
there O
was O
something O
of O
the O
sort O
at O
The O
Hague O
last O
year. O
Old O
as O
is O
the O
idea, O
however, O
there O
were O
one O
or O
two O
details O
which O
were O
new O
to O
me. O
But O
the O
maiden O
herself O
was O
most O
instructive." O
"You O
appeared O
to O
read O
a O
good O
deal O
upon O
her O
which O
was O
quite O
invisible O
to O
me," O
I O
remarked. O
"Not O
invisible O
but O
unnoticed, O
Watson. O
You O
did O
not O
know O
where O
to O
look, O
and O
so O
you O
missed O
all O
that O
was O
important. O
I O
can O
never O
bring O
you O
to O
realise O
the O
importance O
of O
sleeves, O
the O
suggestiveness O
of O
thumb-nails, O
or O
the O
great O
issues O
that O
may O
hang O
from O
a O
boot-lace. O
Now, O
what O
did O
you O
gather O
from O
that O
woman's O
appearance? O
Describe O
it." O
"Well, O
she O
had O
a O
slate-coloured, O
broad-brimmed O
straw O
hat, O
with O
a O
feather O
of O
a O
brickish O
red. O
Her O
jacket O
was O
black, O
with O
black O
beads O
sewn O
upon O
it, O
and O
a O
fringe O
of O
little O
black O
jet O
ornaments. O
Her O
dress O
was O
brown, O
rather O
darker O
than O
coffee O
colour, O
with O
a O
little O
purple O
plush O
at O
the O
neck O
and O
sleeves. O
Her O
gloves O
were O
greyish O
and O
were O
worn O
through O
at O
the O
right O
forefinger. O
Her O
boots O
I O
didn't O
observe. O
She O
had O
small O
round, O
hanging O
gold O
earrings, O
and O
a O
general O
air O
of O
being O
fairly O
well-to-do O
in O
a O
vulgar, O
comfortable, O
easy-going O
way." O
Sherlock O
Holmes O
clapped O
his O
hands O
softly O
together O
and O
chuckled. O
"'Pon O
my O
word, O
Watson, O
you O
are O
coming O
along O
wonderfully. O
You O
have O
really O
done O
very O
well O
indeed. O
It O
is O
true O
that O
you O
have O
missed O
everything O
of O
importance, O
but O
you O
have O
hit O
upon O
the O
method, O
and O
you O
have O
a O
quick O
eye O
for O
colour. O
Never O
trust O
to O
general O
impressions, O
my O
boy, O
but O
concentrate O
yourself O
upon O
details. O
My O
first O
glance O
is O
always O
at O
a O
woman's O
sleeve. O
In O
a O
man O
it O
is O
perhaps O
better O
first O
to O
take O
the O
knee O
of O
the O
trouser. O
As O
you O
observe, O
this O
woman O
had O
plush O
upon O
her O
sleeves, O
which O
is O
a O
most O
useful O
material O
for O
showing O
traces. O
The O
double O
line O
a O
little O
above O
the O
wrist, O
where O
the O
typewritist O
presses O
against O
the O
table, O
was O
beautifully O
defined. O
The O
sewing-machine, O
of O
the O
hand O
type, O
leaves O
a O
similar O
mark, O
but O
only O
on O
the O
left O
arm, O
and O
on O
the O
side O
of O
it O
farthest O
from O
the O
thumb, O
instead O
of O
being O
right O
across O
the O
broadest O
part, O
as O
this O
was. O
I O
then O
glanced O
at O
her O
face, O
and, O
observing O
the O
dint O
of O
a O
pince-nez O
at O
either O
side O
of O
her O
nose, O
I O
ventured O
a O
remark O
upon O
short O
sight O
and O
typewriting, O
which O
seemed O
to O
surprise O
her." O
"It O
surprised O
me." O
"But, O
surely, O
it O
was O
obvious. O
I O
was O
then O
much O
surprised O
and O
interested O
on O
glancing O
down O
to O
observe O
that, O
though O
the O
boots O
which O
she O
was O
wearing O
were O
not O
unlike O
each O
other, O
they O
were O
really O
odd O
ones; O
the O
one O
having O
a O
slightly O
decorated O
toe-cap, O
and O
the O
other O
a O
plain O
one. O
One O
was O
buttoned O
only O
in O
the O
two O
lower O
buttons O
out O
of O
five, O
and O
the O
other O
at O
the O
first, O
third, O
and O
fifth. O
Now, O
when O
you O
see O
that O
a O
young O
lady, O
otherwise O
neatly O
dressed, O
has O
come O
away O
from O
home O
with O
odd O
boots, O
half-buttoned, O
it O
is O
no O
great O
deduction O
to O
say O
that O
she O
came O
away O
in O
a O
hurry." O
"And O
what O
else?" O
I O
asked, O
keenly O
interested, O
as O
I O
always O
was, O
by O
my O
friend's O
incisive O
reasoning. O
"I O
noted, O
in O
passing, O
that O
she O
had O
written O
a O
note O
before O
leaving O
home O
but O
after O
being O
fully O
dressed. O
You O
observed O
that O
her O
right O
glove O
was O
torn O
at O
the O
forefinger, O
but O
you O
did O
not O
apparently O
see O
that O
both O
glove O
and O
finger O
were O
stained O
with O
violet O
ink. O
She O
had O
written O
in O
a O
hurry O
and O
dipped O
her O
pen O
too O
deep. O
It O
must O
have O
been O
this O
morning, O
or O
the O
mark O
would O
not O
remain O
clear O
upon O
the O
finger. O
All O
this O
is O
amusing, O
though O
rather O
elementary, O
but O
I O
must O
go O
back O
to O
business, O
Watson. O
Would O
you O
mind O
reading O
me O
the O
advertised O
description O
of O
Mr. O
Hosmer O
Angel?" O
I O
held O
the O
little O
printed O
slip O
to O
the O
light. O
"Missing," O
it O
said, O
"on O
the O
morning O
of O
the O
fourteenth, O
a O
gentleman O
named O
Hosmer O
Angel. O
About O
five O
ft. O
seven O
in. O
in O
height; O
strongly O
built, O
sallow O
complexion, O
black O
hair, O
a O
little O
bald O
in O
the O
centre, O
bushy, O
black O
side-whiskers O
and O
moustache; O
tinted O
glasses, O
slight O
infirmity O
of O
speech. O
Was O
dressed, O
when O
last O
seen, O
in O
black O
frock-coat O
faced O
with O
silk, O
black O
waistcoat, O
gold O
Albert O
chain, O
and O
grey O
Harris O
tweed O
trousers, O
with O
brown O
gaiters O
over O
elastic-sided O
boots. O
Known O
to O
have O
been O
employed O
in O
an O
office O
in O
Leadenhall O
Street. O
Anybody O
bringing--" O
"That O
will O
do," O
said O
Holmes. O
"As O
to O
the O
letters," O
he O
continued, O
glancing O
over O
them, O
"they O
are O
very O
commonplace. O
Absolutely O
no O
clue O
in O
them O
to O
Mr. O
Angel, O
save O
that O
he O
quotes O
Balzac O
once. O
There O
is O
one O
remarkable O
point, O
however, O
which O
will O
no O
doubt O
strike O
you." O
"They O
are O
typewritten," O
I O
remarked. O
"Not O
only O
that, O
but O
the O
signature O
is O
typewritten. O
Look O
at O
the O
neat O
little O
'Hosmer O
Angel' O
at O
the O
bottom. O
There O
is O
a O
date, O
you O
see, O
but O
no O
superscription O
except O
Leadenhall O
Street, O
which O
is O
rather O
vague. O
The O
point O
about O
the O
signature O
is O
very O
suggestive O
--in O
fact, O
we O
may O
call O
it O
conclusive." O
"Of O
what?" O
"My O
dear O
fellow, O
is O
it O
possible O
you O
do O
not O
see O
how O
strongly O
it O
bears O
upon O
the O
case?" O
"I O
cannot O
say O
that O
I O
do O
unless O
it O
were O
that O
he O
wished O
to O
be O
able O
to O
deny O
his O
signature O
if O
an O
action O
for O
breach O
of O
promise O
were O
instituted." O
"No, O
that O
was O
not O
the O
point. O
However, O
I O
shall O
write O
two O
letters, O
which O
should O
settle O
the O
matter. O
One O
is O
to O
a O
firm O
in O
the O
City, O
the O
other O
is O
to O
the O
young O
lady's O
stepfather, O
Mr. O
Windibank, O
asking O
him O
whether O
he O
could O
meet O
us O
here O
at O
six O
o'clock O
tomorrow O
evening. O
It O
is O
just O
as O
well O
that O
we O
should O
do O
business O
with O
the O
male O
relatives. O
And O
now, O
Doctor, O
we O
can O
do O
nothing O
until O
the O
answers O
to O
those O
letters O
come, O
so O
we O
may O
put O
our O
little O
problem O
upon O
the O
shelf O
for O
the O
interim." O
I O
had O
had O
so O
many O
reasons O
to O
believe O
in O
my O
friend's O
subtle O
powers O
of O
reasoning O
and O
extraordinary O
energy O
in O
action O
that O
I O
felt O
that O
he O
must O
have O
some O
solid O
grounds O
for O
the O
assured O
and O
easy O
demeanour O
with O
which O
he O
treated O
the O
singular O
mystery O
which O
he O
had O
been O
called O
upon O
to O
fathom. O
Once O
only O
had O
I O
known O
him O
to O
fail, O
in O
the O
case O
of O
the O
King O
of O
Bohemia O
and O
of O
the O
Irene O
Adler O
photograph; O
but O
when O
I O
looked O
back O
to O
the O
weird O
business O
of O
the O
Sign O
of O
Four, O
and O
the O
extraordinary O
circumstances O
connected O
with O
the O
Study O
in O
Scarlet, O
I O
felt O
that O
it O
would O
be O
a O
strange O
tangle O
indeed O
which O
he O
could O
not O
unravel. O
I O
left O
him O
then, O
still O
puffing O
at O
his O
black O
clay O
pipe, O
with O
the O
conviction O
that O
when O
I O
came O
again O
on O
the O
next O
evening O
I O
would O
find O
that O
he O
held O
in O
his O
hands O
all O
the O
clues O
which O
would O
lead O
up O
to O
the O
identity O
of O
the O
disappearing O
bridegroom O
of O
Miss O
Mary O
Sutherland. O
A O
professional O
case O
of O
great O
gravity O
was O
engaging O
my O
own O
attention O
at O
the O
time, O
and O
the O
whole O
of O
next O
day O
I O
was O
busy O
at O
the O
bedside O
of O
the O
sufferer. O
It O
was O
not O
until O
close O
upon O
six O
o'clock O
that O
I O
found O
myself O
free O
and O
was O
able O
to O
spring O
into O
a O
hansom O
and O
drive O
to O
Baker O
Street, O
half O
afraid O
that O
I O
might O
be O
too O
late O
to O
assist O
at O
the O
dénouement O
of O
the O
little O
mystery. O
I O
found O
Sherlock O
Holmes O
alone, O
however, O
half O
asleep, O
with O
his O
long, O
thin O
form O
curled O
up O
in O
the O
recesses O
of O
his O
armchair. O
A O
formidable O
array O
of O
bottles O
and O
test-tubes, O
with O
the O
pungent O
cleanly O
smell O
of O
hydrochloric O
acid, O
told O
me O
that O
he O
had O
spent O
his O
day O
in O
the O
chemical O
work O
which O
was O
so O
dear O
to O
him. O
"Well, O
have O
you O
solved O
it?" O
I O
asked O
as O
I O
entered. O
"Yes. O
It O
was O
the O
bisulphate O
of O
baryta." O
"No, O
no, O
the O
mystery!" O
I O
cried. O
"Oh, O
that! O
I O
thought O
of O
the O
salt O
that O
I O
have O
been O
working O
upon. O
There O
was O
never O
any O
mystery O
in O
the O
matter, O
though, O
as O
I O
said O
yesterday, O
some O
of O
the O
details O
are O
of O
interest. O
The O
only O
drawback O
is O
that O
there O
is O
no O
law, O
I O
fear, O
that O
can O
touch O
the O
scoundrel." O
"Who O
was O
he, O
then, O
and O
what O
was O
his O
object O
in O
deserting O
Miss O
Sutherland?" O
The O
question O
was O
hardly O
out O
of O
my O
mouth, O
and O
Holmes O
had O
not O
yet O
opened O
his O
lips O
to O
reply, O
when O
we O
heard O
a O
heavy O
footfall O
in O
the O
passage O
and O
a O
tap O
at O
the O
door. O
"This O
is O
the O
girl's O
stepfather, O
Mr. O
James O
Windibank," O
said O
Holmes. O
"He O
has O
written O
to O
me O
to O
say O
that O
he O
would O
be O
here O
at O
six. O
Come O
in!" O
The O
man O
who O
entered O
was O
a O
sturdy, O
middle-sized O
fellow, O
some O
thirty O
years O
of O
age, O
clean-shaven, O
and O
sallow-skinned, O
with O
a O
bland, O
insinuating O
manner, O
and O
a O
pair O
of O
wonderfully O
sharp O
and O
penetrating O
grey O
eyes. O
He O
shot O
a O
questioning O
glance O
at O
each O
of O
us, O
placed O
his O
shiny O
top-hat O
upon O
the O
sideboard, O
and O
with O
a O
slight O
bow O
sidled O
down O
into O
the O
nearest O
chair. O
"Good-evening, O
Mr. O
James O
Windibank," O
said O
Holmes. O
"I O
think O
that O
this O
typewritten O
letter O
is O
from O
you, O
in O
which O
you O
made O
an O
appointment O
with O
me O
for O
six O
o'clock?" O
"Yes, O
sir. O
I O
am O
afraid O
that O
I O
am O
a O
little O
late, O
but O
I O
am O
not O
quite O
my O
own O
master, O
you O
know. O
I O
am O
sorry O
that O
Miss O
Sutherland O
has O
troubled O
you O
about O
this O
little O
matter, O
for O
I O
think O
it O
is O
far O
better O
not O
to O
wash O
linen O
of O
the O
sort O
in O
public. O
It O
was O
quite O
against O
my O
wishes O
that O
she O
came, O
but O
she O
is O
a O
very O
excitable, O
impulsive O
girl, O
as O
you O
may O
have O
noticed, O
and O
she O
is O
not O
easily O
controlled O
when O
she O
has O
made O
up O
her O
mind O
on O
a O
point. O
Of O
course, O
I O
did O
not O
mind O
you O
so O
much, O
as O
you O
are O
not O
connected O
with O
the O
official O
police, O
but O
it O
is O
not O
pleasant O
to O
have O
a O
family O
misfortune O
like O
this O
noised O
abroad. O
Besides, O
it O
is O
a O
useless O
expense, O
for O
how O
could O
you O
possibly O
find O
this O
Hosmer O
Angel?" O
"On O
the O
contrary," O
said O
Holmes O
quietly; O
"I O
have O
every O
reason O
to O
believe O
that O
I O
will O
succeed O
in O
discovering O
Mr. O
Hosmer O
Angel." O
Mr. O
Windibank O
gave O
a O
violent O
start O
and O
dropped O
his O
gloves. O
"I O
am O
delighted O
to O
hear O
it," O
he O
said. O
"It O
is O
a O
curious O
thing," O
remarked O
Holmes, O
"that O
a O
typewriter O
has O
really O
quite O
as O
much O
individuality O
as O
a O
man's O
handwriting. O
Unless O
they O
are O
quite O
new, O
no O
two O
of O
them O
write O
exactly O
alike. O
Some O
letters O
get O
more O
worn O
than O
others, O
and O
some O
wear O
only O
on O
one O
side. O
Now, O
you O
remark O
in O
this O
note O
of O
yours, O
Mr. O
Windibank, O
that O
in O
every O
case O
there O
is O
some O
little O
slurring O
over O
of O
the O
'e,' O
and O
a O
slight O
defect O
in O
the O
tail O
of O
the O
'r.' O
There O
are O
fourteen O
other O
characteristics, O
but O
those O
are O
the O
more O
obvious." O
"We O
do O
all O
our O
correspondence O
with O
this O
machine O
at O
the O
office, O
and O
no O
doubt O
it O
is O
a O
little O
worn," O
our O
visitor O
answered, O
glancing O
keenly O
at O
Holmes O
with O
his O
bright O
little O
eyes. O
"And O
now O
I O
will O
show O
you O
what O
is O
really O
a O
very O
interesting O
study, O
Mr. O
Windibank," O
Holmes O
continued. O
"I O
think O
of O
writing O
another O
little O
monograph O
some O
of O
these O
days O
on O
the O
typewriter O
and O
its O
relation O
to O
crime. O
It O
is O
a O
subject O
to O
which O
I O
have O
devoted O
some O
little O
attention. O
I O
have O
here O
four O
letters O
which O
purport O
to O
come O
from O
the O
missing O
man. O
They O
are O
all O
typewritten. O
In O
each O
case, O
not O
only O
are O
the O
'e's' O
slurred O
and O
the O
'r's' O
tailless, O
but O
you O
will O
observe, O
if O
you O
care O
to O
use O
my O
magnifying O
lens, O
that O
the O
fourteen O
other O
characteristics O
to O
which O
I O
have O
alluded O
are O
there O
as O
well." O
Mr. O
Windibank O
sprang O
out O
of O
his O
chair O
and O
picked O
up O
his O
hat. O
"I O
cannot O
waste O
time O
over O
this O
sort O
of O
fantastic O
talk, O
Mr. O
Holmes," O
he O
said. O
"If O
you O
can O
catch O
the O
man, O
catch O
him, O
and O
let O
me O
know O
when O
you O
have O
done O
it." O
"Certainly," O
said O
Holmes, O
stepping O
over O
and O
turning O
the O
key O
in O
the O
door. O
"I O
let O
you O
know, O
then, O
that O
I O
have O
caught O
him!" O
"What! O
where?" O
shouted O
Mr. O
Windibank, O
turning O
white O
to O
his O
lips O
and O
glancing O
about O
him O
like O
a O
rat O
in O
a O
trap. O
"Oh, O
it O
won't O
do-- O
really O
it O
won't," O
said O
Holmes O
suavely. O
"There O
is O
no O
possible O
getting O
out O
of O
it, O
Mr. O
Windibank. O
It O
is O
quite O
too O
transparent, O
and O
it O
was O
a O
very O
bad O
compliment O
when O
you O
said O
that O
it O
was O
impossible O
for O
me O
to O
solve O
so O
simple O
a O
question. O
That's O
right! O
Sit O
down O
and O
let O
us O
talk O
it O
over." O
Our O
visitor O
collapsed O
into O
a O
chair, O
with O
a O
ghastly O
face O
and O
a O
glitter O
of O
moisture O
on O
his O
brow. O
"It-- O
it's O
not O
actionable," O
he O
stammered. O
"I O
am O
very O
much O
afraid O
that O
it O
is O
not. O
But O
between O
ourselves, O
Windibank, O
it O
was O
as O
cruel O
and O
selfish O
and O
heartless O
a O
trick O
in O
a O
petty O
way O
as O
ever O
came O
before O
me. O
Now, O
let O
me O
just O
run O
over O
the O
course O
of O
events, O
and O
you O
will O
contradict O
me O
if O
I O
go O
wrong." O
The O
man O
sat O
huddled O
up O
in O
his O
chair, O
with O
his O
head O
sunk O
upon O
his O
breast, O
like O
one O
who O
is O
utterly O
crushed. O
Holmes O
stuck O
his O
feet O
up O
on O
the O
corner O
of O
the O
mantelpiece O
and, O
leaning O
back O
with O
his O
hands O
in O
his O
pockets, O
began O
talking, O
rather O
to O
himself, O
as O
it O
seemed, O
than O
to O
us. O
"The O
man O
married O
a O
woman O
very O
much O
older O
than O
himself O
for O
her O
money," O
said O
he, O
"and O
he O
enjoyed O
the O
use O
of O
the O
money O
of O
the O
daughter O
as O
long O
as O
she O
lived O
with O
them. O
It O
was O
a O
considerable O
sum, O
for O
people O
in O
their O
position, O
and O
the O
loss O
of O
it O
would O
have O
made O
a O
serious O
difference. O
It O
was O
worth O
an O
effort O
to O
preserve O
it. O
The O
daughter O
was O
of O
a O
good, O
amiable O
disposition, O
but O
affectionate O
and O
warm-hearted O
in O
her O
ways, O
so O
that O
it O
was O
evident O
that O
with O
her O
fair O
personal O
advantages, O
and O
her O
little O
income, O
she O
would O
not O
be O
allowed O
to O
remain O
single O
long. O
Now O
her O
marriage O
would O
mean, O
of O
course, O
the O
loss O
of O
a O
hundred O
a O
year, O
so O
what O
does O
her O
stepfather O
do O
to O
prevent O
it? O
He O
takes O
the O
obvious O
course O
of O
keeping O
her O
at O
home O
and O
forbidding O
her O
to O
seek O
the O
company O
of O
people O
of O
her O
own O
age. O
But O
soon O
he O
found O
that O
that O
would O
not O
answer O
forever. O
She O
became O
restive, O
insisted O
upon O
her O
rights, O
and O
finally O
announced O
her O
positive O
intention O
of O
going O
to O
a O
certain O
ball. O
What O
does O
her O
clever O
stepfather O
do O
then? O
He O
conceives O
an O
idea O
more O
creditable O
to O
his O
head O
than O
to O
his O
heart. O
With O
the O
connivance O
and O
assistance O
of O
his O
wife O
he O
disguised O
himself, O
covered O
those O
keen O
eyes O
with O
tinted O
glasses, O
masked O
the O
face O
with O
a O
moustache O
and O
a O
pair O
of O
bushy O
whiskers, O
sunk O
that O
clear O
voice O
into O
an O
insinuating O
whisper, O
and O
doubly O
secure O
on O
account O
of O
the O
girl's O
short O
sight, O
he O
appears O
as O
Mr. O
Hosmer O
Angel, O
and O
keeps O
off O
other O
lovers O
by O
making O
love O
himself." O
"It O
was O
only O
a O
joke O
at O
first," O
groaned O
our O
visitor. O
"We O
never O
thought O
that O
she O
would O
have O
been O
so O
carried O
away." O
"Very O
likely O
not. O
However O
that O
may O
be, O
the O
young O
lady O
was O
very O
decidedly O
carried O
away, O
and, O
having O
quite O
made O
up O
her O
mind O
that O
her O
stepfather O
was O
in O
France, O
the O
suspicion O
of O
treachery O
never O
for O
an O
instant O
entered O
her O
mind. O
She O
was O
flattered O
by O
the O
gentleman's O
attentions, O
and O
the O
effect O
was O
increased O
by O
the O
loudly O
expressed O
admiration O
of O
her O
mother. O
Then O
Mr. O
Angel O
began O
to O
call, O
for O
it O
was O
obvious O
that O
the O
matter O
should O
be O
pushed O
as O
far O
as O
it O
would O
go O
if O
a O
real O
effect O
were O
to O
be O
produced. O
There O
were O
meetings, O
and O
an O
engagement, O
which O
would O
finally O
secure O
the O
girl's O
affections O
from O
turning O
towards O
anyone O
else. O
But O
the O
deception O
could O
not O
be O
kept O
up O
forever. O
These O
pretended O
journeys O
to O
France O
were O
rather O
cumbrous. O
The O
thing O
to O
do O
was O
clearly O
to O
bring O
the O
business O
to O
an O
end O
in O
such O
a O
dramatic O
manner O
that O
it O
would O
leave O
a O
permanent O
impression O
upon O
the O
young O
lady's O
mind O
and O
prevent O
her O
from O
looking O
upon O
any O
other O
suitor O
for O
some O
time O
to O
come. O
Hence O
those O
vows O
of O
fidelity O
exacted O
upon O
a O
Testament, O
and O
hence O
also O
the O
allusions O
to O
a O
possibility O
of O
something O
happening O
on O
the O
very O
morning O
of O
the O
wedding. O
James O
Windibank O
wished O
Miss O
Sutherland O
to O
be O
so O
bound O
to O
Hosmer O
Angel, O
and O
so O
uncertain O
as O
to O
his O
fate, O
that O
for O
ten O
years O
to O
come, O
at O
any O
rate, O
she O
would O
not O
listen O
to O
another O
man. O
As O
far O
as O
the O
church O
door O
he O
brought O
her, O
and O
then, O
as O
he O
could O
go O
no O
farther, O
he O
conveniently O
vanished O
away O
by O
the O
old O
trick O
of O
stepping O
in O
at O
one O
door O
of O
a O
four-wheeler O
and O
out O
at O
the O
other. O
I O
think O
that O
was O
the O
chain O
of O
events, O
Mr. O
Windibank!" O
Our O
visitor O
had O
recovered O
something O
of O
his O
assurance O
while O
Holmes O
had O
been O
talking, O
and O
he O
rose O
from O
his O
chair O
now O
with O
a O
cold O
sneer O
upon O
his O
pale O
face. O
"It O
may O
be O
so, O
or O
it O
may O
not, O
Mr. O
Holmes," O
said O
he, O
"but O
if O
you O
are O
so O
very O
sharp O
you O
ought O
to O
be O
sharp O
enough O
to O
know O
that O
it O
is O
you O
who O
are O
breaking O
the O
law O
now, O
and O
not O
me. O
I O
have O
done O
nothing O
actionable O
from O
the O
first, O
but O
as O
long O
as O
you O
keep O
that O
door O
locked O
you O
lay O
yourself O
open O
to O
an O
action O
for O
assault O
and O
illegal O
constraint." O
"The O
law O
cannot, O
as O
you O
say, O
touch O
you," O
said O
Holmes, O
unlocking O
and O
throwing O
open O
the O
door, O
"yet O
there O
never O
was O
a O
man O
who O
deserved O
punishment O
more. O
If O
the O
young O
lady O
has O
a O
brother O
or O
a O
friend, O
he O
ought O
to O
lay O
a O
whip O
across O
your O
shoulders. O
By O
Jove!" O
he O
continued, O
flushing O
up O
at O
the O
sight O
of O
the O
bitter O
sneer O
upon O
the O
man's O
face, O
"it O
is O
not O
part O
of O
my O
duties O
to O
my O
client, O
but O
here's O
a O
hunting O
crop O
handy, O
and O
I O
think O
I O
shall O
just O
treat O
myself O
to--" O
He O
took O
two O
swift O
steps O
to O
the O
whip, O
but O
before O
he O
could O
grasp O
it O
there O
was O
a O
wild O
clatter O
of O
steps O
upon O
the O
stairs, O
the O
heavy O
hall O
door O
banged, O
and O
from O
the O
window O
we O
could O
see O
Mr. O
James O
Windibank O
running O
at O
the O
top O
of O
his O
speed O
down O
the O
road. O
"There's O
a O
cold-blooded O
scoundrel!" O
said O
Holmes, O
laughing, O
as O
he O
threw O
himself O
down O
into O
his O
chair O
once O
more. O
"That O
fellow O
will O
rise O
from O
crime O
to O
crime O
until O
he O
does O
something O
very O
bad, O
and O
ends O
on O
a O
gallows. O
The O
case O
has, O
in O
some O
respects, O
been O
not O
entirely O
devoid O
of O
interest." O
"I O
cannot O
now O
entirely O
see O
all O
the O
steps O
of O
your O
reasoning," O
I O
remarked. O
"Well, O
of O
course O
it O
was O
obvious O
from O
the O
first O
that O
this O
Mr. O
Hosmer O
Angel O
must O
have O
some O
strong O
object O
for O
his O
curious O
conduct, O
and O
it O
was O
equally O
clear O
that O
the O
only O
man O
who O
really O
profited O
by O
the O
incident, O
as O
far O
as O
we O
could O
see, O
was O
the O
stepfather. O
Then O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
two O
men O
were O
never O
together, O
but O
that O
the O
one O
always O
appeared O
when O
the O
other O
was O
away, O
was O
suggestive. O
So O
were O
the O
tinted O
spectacles O
and O
the O
curious O
voice, O
which O
both O
hinted O
at O
a O
disguise, O
as O
did O
the O
bushy O
whiskers. O
My O
suspicions O
were O
all O
confirmed O
by O
his O
peculiar O
action O
in O
typewriting O
his O
signature, O
which, O
of O
course, O
inferred O
that O
his O
handwriting O
was O
so O
familiar O
to O
her O
that O
she O
would O
recognise O
even O
the O
smallest O
sample O
of O
it. O
You O
see O
all O
these O
isolated O
facts, O
together O
with O
many O
minor O
ones, O
all O
pointed O
in O
the O
same O
direction." O
"And O
how O
did O
you O
verify O
them?" O
"Having O
once O
spotted O
my O
man, O
it O
was O
easy O
to O
get O
corroboration. O
I O
knew O
the O
firm O
for O
which O
this O
man O
worked. O
Having O
taken O
the O
printed O
description. O
I O
eliminated O
everything O
from O
it O
which O
could O
be O
the O
result O
of O
a O
disguise-- O
the O
whiskers, O
the O
glasses, O
the O
voice, O
and O
I O
sent O
it O
to O
the O
firm, O
with O
a O
request O
that O
they O
would O
inform O
me O
whether O
it O
answered O
to O
the O
description O
of O
any O
of O
their O
travellers. O
I O
had O
already O
noticed O
the O
peculiarities O
of O
the O
typewriter, O
and O
I O
wrote O
to O
the O
man O
himself O
at O
his O
business O
address O
asking O
him O
if O
he O
would O
come O
here. O
As O
I O
expected, O
his O
reply O
was O
typewritten O
and O
revealed O
the O
same O
trivial O
but O
characteristic O
defects. O
The O
same O
post O
brought O
me O
a O
letter O
from O
Westhouse O
& O
Marbank, O
of O
Fenchurch O
Street, O
to O
say O
that O
the O
description O
tallied O
in O
every O
respect O
with O
that O
of O
their O
employé, O
James O
Windibank. O
Voilà O
tout!" O
"And O
Miss O
Sutherland?" O
"If O
I O
tell O
her O
she O
will O
not O
believe O
me. O
You O
may O
remember O
the O
old O
Persian O
saying, O
'There O
is O
danger O
for O
him O
who O
taketh O
the O
tiger O
cub, O
and O
danger O
also O
for O
whoso O
snatches O
a O
delusion O
from O
a O
woman.' O
There O
is O
as O
much O
sense O
in O
Hafiz O
as O
in O
Horace, O
and O
as O
much O
knowledge O
of O
the O
world." O
 O
 O

 O
I O
had O
called O
upon O
my O
friend, O
Mr. O
Sherlock O
Holmes, O
one O
day O
in O
the O
autumn O
of O
last O
year O
and O
found O
him O
in O
deep O
conversation O
with O
a O
very O
stout, O
florid-faced, O
elderly O
gentleman O
with O
fiery O
red O
hair. O
With O
an O
apology O
for O
my O
intrusion, O
I O
was O
about O
to O
withdraw O
when O
Holmes O
pulled O
me O
abruptly O
into O
the O
room O
and O
closed O
the O
door O
behind O
me. Entity
"You Quotation
could Quotation
not Quotation
possibly Quotation
have Quotation
come Quotation
at Quotation
a Quotation
better Quotation
time, Quotation
my Quotation
dear Quotation
Watson," Quotation
he Entity
said Cue
cordially. O
"I Quotation
was Quotation
afraid Quotation
that Quotation
you Quotation
were Quotation
engaged." Quotation
"So Quotation
I Quotation
am. Quotation
Very Quotation
much Quotation
so." Quotation
"Then Quotation
I Quotation
can Quotation
wait Quotation
in Quotation
the Quotation
next Quotation
room." Quotation
"Not Quotation
at Quotation
all. Quotation
This Quotation
gentleman, Quotation
Mr. Quotation
Wilson, Quotation
has Quotation
been Quotation
my Quotation
partner Quotation
and Quotation
helper Quotation
in Quotation
many Quotation
of Quotation
my Quotation
most Quotation
successful Quotation
cases, Quotation
and Quotation
I Quotation
have Quotation
no Quotation
doubt Quotation
that Quotation
he Quotation
will Quotation
be Quotation
of Quotation
the Quotation
utmost Quotation
use Quotation
to Quotation
me Quotation
in Quotation
yours Quotation
also." Quotation
The O
stout O
gentleman O
half O
rose O
from O
his O
chair O
and O
gave O
a O
bob O
of O
greeting, O
with O
a O
quick O
little O
questioning O
glance O
from O
his O
small O
fat-encircled O
eyes. O
"Try Quotation
the Quotation
settee," Quotation
said Cue
Holmes, Entity
relapsing O
into O
his O
armchair O
and O
putting O
his O
fingertips O
together, O
as O
was O
his O
custom O
when O
in O
judicial O
moods. O
"I Quotation
know, Quotation
my Quotation
dear Quotation
Watson, Quotation
that Quotation
you Quotation
share Quotation
my Quotation
love Quotation
of Quotation
all Quotation
that Quotation
is Quotation
bizarre Quotation
and Quotation
outside Quotation
the Quotation
conventions Quotation
and Quotation
humdrum Quotation
routine Quotation
of Quotation
everyday Quotation
life. Quotation
You Quotation
have Quotation
shown Quotation
your Quotation
relish Quotation
for Quotation
it Quotation
by Quotation
the Quotation
enthusiasm Quotation
which Quotation
has Quotation
prompted Quotation
you Quotation
to Quotation
chronicle, Quotation
and, Quotation
if Quotation
you Quotation
will Quotation
excuse Quotation
my Quotation
saying Quotation
so, Quotation
somewhat Quotation
to Quotation
embellish Quotation
so Quotation
many Quotation
of Quotation
my Quotation
own Quotation
little Quotation
adventures." Quotation
"Your Quotation
cases Quotation
have Quotation
indeed Quotation
been Quotation
of Quotation
the Quotation
greatest Quotation
interest Quotation
to Quotation
me," Quotation
I Entity
observed. Cue
"You Quotation
will Quotation
remember Quotation
that Quotation
I Quotation
remarked Quotation
the Quotation
other Quotation
day, Quotation
just Quotation
before Quotation
we Quotation
went Quotation
into Quotation
the Quotation
very Quotation
simple Quotation
problem Quotation
presented Quotation
by Quotation
Miss Quotation
Mary Quotation
Sutherland, Quotation
that Quotation
for Quotation
strange Quotation
effects Quotation
and Quotation
extraordinary Quotation
combinations Quotation
we Quotation
must Quotation
go Quotation
to Quotation
life Quotation
itself, Quotation
which Quotation
is Quotation
always Quotation
far Quotation
more Quotation
daring Quotation
than Quotation
any Quotation
effort Quotation
of Quotation
the Quotation
imagination." Quotation
"A Quotation
proposition Quotation
which Quotation
I Quotation
took Quotation
the Quotation
liberty Quotation
of Quotation
doubting." Quotation
"You Quotation
did, Quotation
Doctor, Quotation
but Quotation
none Quotation
the Quotation
less Quotation
you Quotation
must Quotation
come Quotation
round Quotation
to Quotation
my Quotation
view, Quotation
for Quotation
otherwise Quotation
I Quotation
shall Quotation
keep Quotation
on Quotation
piling Quotation
fact Quotation
upon Quotation
fact Quotation
on Quotation
you Quotation
until Quotation
your Quotation
reason Quotation
breaks Quotation
down Quotation
under Quotation
them Quotation
and Quotation
acknowledges Quotation
me Quotation
to Quotation
be Quotation
right. Quotation
Now, Quotation
Mr. Quotation
Jabez Quotation
Wilson Quotation
here Quotation
has Quotation
been Quotation
good Quotation
enough Quotation
to Quotation
call Quotation
upon Quotation
me Quotation
this Quotation
morning, Quotation
and Quotation
to Quotation
begin Quotation
a Quotation
narrative Quotation
which Quotation
promises Quotation
to Quotation
be Quotation
one Quotation
of Quotation
the Quotation
most Quotation
singular Quotation
which Quotation
I Quotation
have Quotation
listened Quotation
to Quotation
for Quotation
some Quotation
time. Quotation
You Quotation
have Quotation
heard Quotation
me Quotation
remark Quotation
that Quotation
the Quotation
strangest Quotation
and Quotation
most Quotation
unique Quotation
things Quotation
are Quotation
very Quotation
often Quotation
connected Quotation
not Quotation
with Quotation
the Quotation
larger Quotation
but Quotation
with Quotation
the Quotation
smaller Quotation
crimes, Quotation
and Quotation
occasionally, Quotation
indeed, Quotation
where Quotation
there Quotation
is Quotation
room Quotation
for Quotation
doubt Quotation
whether Quotation
any Quotation
positive Quotation
crime Quotation
has Quotation
been Quotation
committed. Quotation
As Quotation
far Quotation
as Quotation
I Quotation
have Quotation
heard Quotation
it Quotation
is Quotation
impossible Quotation
for Quotation
me Quotation
to Quotation
say Quotation
whether Quotation
the Quotation
present Quotation
case Quotation
is Quotation
an Quotation
instance Quotation
of Quotation
crime Quotation
or Quotation
not, Quotation
but Quotation
the Quotation
course Quotation
of Quotation
events Quotation
is Quotation
certainly Quotation
among Quotation
the Quotation
most Quotation
singular Quotation
that Quotation
I Quotation
have Quotation
ever Quotation
listened Quotation
to. Quotation
Perhaps, Quotation
Mr. Quotation
Wilson, Quotation
you Quotation
would Quotation
have Quotation
the Quotation
great Quotation
kindness Quotation
to Quotation
recommence Quotation
your Quotation
narrative. Quotation
I Quotation
ask Quotation
you Quotation
not Quotation
merely Quotation
because Quotation
my Quotation
friend Quotation
Dr. Quotation
Watson Quotation
has Quotation
not Quotation
heard Quotation
the Quotation
opening Quotation
part Quotation
but Quotation
also Quotation
because Quotation
the Quotation
peculiar Quotation
nature Quotation
of Quotation
the Quotation
story Quotation
makes Quotation
me Quotation
anxious Quotation
to Quotation
have Quotation
every Quotation
possible Quotation
detail Quotation
from Quotation
your Quotation
lips. Quotation
As Quotation
a Quotation
rule, Quotation
when Quotation
I Quotation
have Quotation
heard Quotation
some Quotation
slight Quotation
indication Quotation
of Quotation
the Quotation
course Quotation
of Quotation
events, Quotation
I Quotation
am Quotation
able Quotation
to Quotation
guide Quotation
myself Quotation
by Quotation
the Quotation
thousands Quotation
of Quotation
other Quotation
similar Quotation
cases Quotation
which Quotation
occur Quotation
to Quotation
my Quotation
memory. Quotation
In Quotation
the Quotation
present Quotation
instance Quotation
I Quotation
am Quotation
forced Quotation
to Quotation
admit Quotation
that Quotation
the Quotation
facts Quotation
are, Quotation
to Quotation
the Quotation
best Quotation
of Quotation
my Quotation
belief, Quotation
unique." Quotation
The Entity
portly Entity
client Entity
puffed O
out O
his O
chest O
with O
an O
appearance O
of O
some O
little O
pride O
and O
pulled O
a O
dirty O
and O
wrinkled O
newspaper O
from O
the O
inside O
pocket O
of O
his O
greatcoat. O
As O
he O
glanced O
down O
the O
advertisement O
column, O
with O
his O
head O
thrust O
forward O
and O
the O
paper O
flattened O
out O
upon O
his O
knee, O
I O
took O
a O
good O
look O
at O
the O
man O
and O
endeavoured, O
after O
the O
fashion O
of O
my O
companion, O
to O
read O
the O
indications O
which O
might O
be O
presented O
by O
his O
dress O
or O
appearance. O
I O
did O
not O
gain O
very O
much, O
however, O
by O
my O
inspection. O
Our O
visitor O
bore O
every O
mark O
of O
being O
an O
average O
commonplace O
British O
tradesman, O
obese, O
pompous, O
and O
slow. O
He O
wore O
rather O
baggy O
grey O
shepherd's O
check O
trousers, O
a O
not O
over-clean O
black O
frock-coat, O
unbuttoned O
in O
the O
front, O
and O
a O
drab O
waistcoat O
with O
a O
heavy O
brassy O
Albert O
chain, O
and O
a O
square O
pierced O
bit O
of O
metal O
dangling O
down O
as O
an O
ornament. O
A O
frayed O
top-hat O
and O
a O
faded O
brown O
overcoat O
with O
a O
wrinkled O
velvet O
collar O
lay O
upon O
a O
chair O
beside O
him. O
Altogether, O
look O
as O
I O
would, O
there O
was O
nothing O
remarkable O
about O
the O
man O
save O
his O
blazing O
red O
head, O
and O
the O
expression O
of O
extreme O
chagrin O
and O
discontent O
upon O
his O
features. O
Sherlock Entity
Holmes' Entity
quick O
eye O
took O
in O
my O
occupation, O
and O
he O
shook O
his O
head O
with O
a O
smile O
as O
he O
noticed O
my O
questioning O
glances. O
"Beyond Quotation
the Quotation
obvious Quotation
facts Quotation
that Quotation
he Quotation
has Quotation
at Quotation
some Quotation
time Quotation
done Quotation
manual Quotation
labour, Quotation
that Quotation

takes Quotation
snuff, Quotation
that Quotation
he Quotation
is Quotation
a Quotation
Freemason, Quotation
that Quotation
he Quotation
has Quotation
been Quotation
in Quotation
China, Quotation
and Quotation
that Quotation
he Quotation
has Quotation
done Quotation
a Quotation
considerable Quotation
amount Quotation
of Quotation
writing Quotation
lately, Quotation
I Quotation
can Quotation
deduce Quotation
nothing Quotation
else." Quotation
Mr. O
Jabez O
Wilson O
started O
up O
in O
his O
chair, O
with O
his O
forefinger O
upon O
the O
paper, O
but O
his O
eyes O
upon O
my Entity
companion. Entity
"How, O
in O
the O
name O
of O
good-fortune, O
did O
you O
know O
all O
that, O
Mr. O
Holmes?" O
he O
asked. O
"How O
did O
you O
know, O
for O
example, O
that O
I O
did O
manual O
labour. O
It's O
as O
true O
as O
gospel, O
for O
I O
began O
as O
a O
ship's O
carpenter." O
"Your O
hands, O
my O
dear O
sir. O
Your O
right O
hand O
is O
quite O
a O
size O
larger O
than O
your O
left. O
You O
have O
worked O
with O
it, O
and O
the O
muscles O
are O
more O
developed." O
"Well, O
the O
snuff, O
then, O
and O
the O
Freemasonry?" O
"I O
won't O
insult O
your O
intelligence O
by O
telling O
you O
how O
I O
read O
that, O
especially O
as, O
rather O
against O
the O
strict O
rules O
of O
your O
order, O
you O
use O
an O
arc-and-compass O
breastpin." O
"Ah, O
of O
course, O
I O
forgot O
that. O
But O
the O
writing?" O
"What O
else O
can O
be O
indicated O
by O
that O
right O
cuff O
so O
very O
shiny O
for O
five O
inches, O
and O
the O
left O
one O
with O
the O
smooth O
patch O
near O
the O
elbow O
where O
you O
rest O
it O
upon O
the O
desk?" O
"Well, O
but O
China?" O
"The O
fish O
that O
you O
have O
tattooed O
immediately O
above O
your O
right O
wrist O
could O
only O
have O
been O
done O
in O
China. O
I O
have O
made O
a O
small O
study O
of O
tattoo O
marks O
and O
have O
even O
contributed O
to O
the O
literature O
of O
the O
subject. O
That O
trick O
of O
staining O
the O
fishes' O
scales O
of O
a O
delicate O
pink O
is O
quite O
peculiar O
to O
China. O
When, O
in O
addition, O
I O
see O
a O
Chinese O
coin O
hanging O
from O
your O
watch-chain, O
the O
matter O
becomes O
even O
more O
simple." O
Mr. O
Jabez O
Wilson O
laughed O
heavily. O
"Well, O
I O
never!" O
said O
he. O
"I O
thought O
at O
first O
that O
you O
had O
done O
something O
clever, O
but O
I O
see O
that O
there O
was O
nothing O
in O
it, O
after O
all." O
"I O
begin O
to O
think, O
Watson," O
said O
Holmes, O
"that O
I O
make O
a O
mistake O
in O
explaining. O
'Omne O
ignotum O
pro O
magnifico,' O
you O
know, O
and O
my O
poor O
little O
reputation, O
such O
as O
it O
is, O
will O
suffer O
shipwreck O
if O
I O
am O
so O
candid. O
Can O
you O
not O
find O
the O
advertisement, O
Mr. O
Wilson?" O
"Yes, O
I O
have O
got O
it O
now," O
he O
answered O
with O
his O
thick O
red O
finger O
planted O
halfway O
down O
the O
column. O
"Here O
it O
is. O
This O
is O
what O
began O
it O
all. O
You O
just O
read O
it O
for O
yourself, O
sir." O
I O
took O
the O
paper O
from O
him O
and O
read O
as O
follows: O
"TO O

"What O
on O
earth O
does O
this O
mean?" O
I O
ejaculated O
after O
I O
had O
twice O
read O
over O
the O
extraordinary O
announcement. O
Holmes O
chuckled O
and O
wriggled O
in O
his O
chair, O
as O
was O
his O
habit O
when O
in O
high O
spirits. O
"It O
is O
a O
little O
off O
the O
beaten O
track, O
isn't O
it?" O
said O
he. O
"And O
now, O
Mr. O
Wilson, O
off O
you O
go O
at O
scratch O
and O
tell O
us O
all O
about O
yourself, O
your O
household, O
and O
the O
effect O
which O
this O
advertisement O
had O
upon O
your O
fortunes. O
You O
will O
first O
make O
a O
note, O
Doctor, O
of O
the O
paper O
and O
the O
date." O
"It O
is O
The O
Morning O
Chronicle O
of O
April O
27, O
1890. O
Just O
two O
months O
ago." O
"Very O
good. O
Now, O
Mr. O
Wilson?" O
"Well, O
it O
is O
just O
as O
I O
have O
been O
telling O
you, O
Mr. O
Sherlock O
Holmes," O
said O
Jabez O
Wilson, O
mopping O
his O
forehead; O
"I O
have O
a O
small O
pawnbroker's O
business O
at O
Coburg O
Square, O
near O
the O
City. O
It's O
not O
a O
very O
large O
affair, O
and O
of O
late O
years O
it O
has O
not O
done O
more O
than O
just O
give O
me O
a O
living. O
I O
used O
to O
be O
able O
to O
keep O
two O
assistants, O
but O
now O
I O
only O
keep O
one; O
and O
I O
would O
have O
a O
job O
to O
pay O
him O
but O
that O
he O
is O
willing O
to O
come O
for O
half O
wages O
so O
as O
to O
learn O
the O
business." O
"What O
is O
the O
name O
of O
this O
obliging O
youth?" O
asked O
Sherlock O
Holmes. O
"His O
name O
is O
Vincent O
Spaulding, O
and O
he's O
not O
such O
a O
youth, O
either. O
It's O
hard O
to O
say O
his O
age. O
I O
should O
not O
wish O
a O
smarter O
assistant, O
Mr. O
Holmes; O
and O
I O
know O
very O
well O
that O
he O
could O
better O
himself O
and O
earn O
twice O
what O
I O
am O
able O
to O
give O
him. O
But, O
after O
all, O
if O
he O
is O
satisfied, O
why O
should O
I O
put O
ideas O
in O
his O
head?" O
"Why, O
indeed? O
You O
seem O
most O
fortunate O
in O
having O
an O
employé O
who O
comes O
under O
the O
full O
market O
price. O
It O
is O
not O
a O
common O
experience O
among O
employers O
in O
this O
age. O
I O
don't O
know O
that O
your O
assistant O
is O
not O
as O
remarkable O
as O
your O
advertisement." O
"Oh, O
he O
has O
his O
faults, O
too," O
said O
Mr. O
Wilson. O
"Never O
was O
such O
a O
fellow O
for O
photography. O
Snapping O
away O
with O
a O
camera O
when O
he O
ought O
to O
be O
improving O
his O
mind, O
and O
then O
diving O
down O
into O
the O
cellar O
like O
a O
rabbit O
into O
its O
hole O
to O
develop O
his O
pictures. O
That O
is O
his O
main O
fault, O
but O
on O
the O
whole O
he's O
a O
good O
worker. O
There's O
no O
vice O
in O
him." O
"He O
is O
still O
with O
you, O
I O
presume?" O
"Yes, O
sir. O
He O
and O
a O
girl O
of O
fourteen, O
who O
does O
a O
bit O
of O
simple O
cooking O
and O
keeps O
the O
place O
clean-- O
that's O
all O
I O
have O
in O
the O
house, O
for O
I O
am O
a O
widower O
and O
never O
had O
any O
family. O
We O
live O
very O
quietly, O
sir, O
the O
three O
of O
us; O
and O
we O
keep O
a O
roof O
over O
our O
heads O
and O
pay O
our O
debts, O
if O
we O
do O
nothing O
more. O
 O
The O
first O
thing O
that O
put O
us O
out O
was O
that O
advertisement. O
Spaulding, O
he O
came O
down O
into O
the O
office O
just O
this O
day O
eight O
weeks, O
with O
this O
very O
paper O
in O
his O
hand, O
and O
he O
says: O
 O
'I O
wish O
to O
the O
Lord, O
Mr. O
Wilson, O
that O
I O
was O
a O
red-headed O
man.' O
 O
'Why O
that?' O
I O
asks. O
 O
'Why,' O
says O
he, O
'here's O
another O
vacancy O
on O
the O
League O
of O
the O
Red-headed O
Men. O
It's O
worth O
quite O
a O
little O
fortune O
to O
any O
man O
who O
gets O
it, O
and O
I O
understand O
that O
there O
are O
more O
vacancies O
than O
there O
are O
men, O
so O
that O
the O
trustees O
are O
at O
their O
wits' O
end O
what O
to O
do O
with O
the O
money. O
If O
my O
hair O
would O
only O
change O
colour, O
here's O
a O
nice O
little O
crib O
all O
ready O
for O
me O
to O
step O
into.' O
 O
'Why, O
what O
is O
it, O
then?' O
I O
asked. O
You O
see, O
Mr. O
Holmes, O
I O
am O
a O
very O
stay-at-home O
man, O
and O
as O
my O
business O
came O
to O
me O
instead O
of O
my O
having O
to O
go O
to O
it, O
I O
was O
often O
weeks O
on O
end O
without O
putting O
my O
foot O
over O
the O
door-mat. O
In O
that O
way O
I O
didn't O
know O
much O
of O
what O
was O
going O
on O
outside, O
and O
I O
was O
always O
glad O
of O
a O
bit O
of O
news. O
 O
'Have O
you O
never O
heard O
of O
the O
League O
of O
the O
Red-headed O
Men?' O
he O
asked O
with O
his O
eyes O
open. O
 O
'Never.' O
 O
'Why, O
I O
wonder O
at O
that, O
for O
you O
are O
eligible O
yourself O
for O
one O
of O
the O
vacancies.' O
 O
'And O
what O
are O
they O
worth?' O
I O
asked. O
 O
'Oh, O
merely O
a O
couple O
of O
hundred O
a O
year, O
but O
the O
work O
is O
slight, O
and O
it O
need O
not O
interfere O
very O
much O
with O
one's O
other O
occupations.' O
 O
Well, O
you O
can O
easily O
think O
that O
that O
made O
me O
prick O
up O
my O
ears, O
for O
the O
business O
has O
not O
been O
over-good O
for O
some O
years, O
and O
an O
extra O
couple O
of O
hundred O
would O
have O
been O
very O
handy. O
 O
'Tell O
me O
all O
about O
it,' O
said O
I. O
'Well,' O
said O
he, O
showing O
me O
the O
advertisement, O
'you O
can O
see O
for O
yourself O
that O
the O
League O
has O
a O
vacancy, O
and O
there O
is O
the O
address O
where O
you O
should O
apply O
for O
particulars. O
As O
far O
as O
I O
can O
make O
out, O
the O
League O
was O
founded O
by O
an O
American O
millionaire, O
Ezekiah O
Hopkins, O
who O
was O
very O
peculiar O
in O
his O
ways. O
He O
was O
himself O
red-headed, O
and O
he O
had O
a O
great O
sympathy O
for O
all O
red-headed O
men; O
so O
when O
he O
died O
it O
was O
found O
that O
he O
had O
left O
his O
enormous O
fortune O
in O
the O
hands O
of O
trustees, O
with O
instructions O
to O
apply O
the O
interest O
to O
the O
providing O
of O
easy O
berths O
to O
men O
whose O
hair O
is O
of O
that O
colour. O
From O
all O
I O
hear O
it O
is O
splendid O
pay O
and O
very O
little O
to O
do.' O
 O
'But,' O
said O
I, O
'there O
would O
be O
millions O
of O
red-headed O
men O
who O
would O
apply.' O
 O
'Not O
so O
many O
as O
you O
might O
think,' O
he O
answered. O
'You O
see O
it O
is O
really O
confined O
to O
Londoners, O
and O
to O
grown O
men. O
This O
American O
had O
started O
from O
London O
when O
he O
was O
young, O
and O
he O
wanted O
to O
do O
the O
old O
town O
a O
good O
turn. O
Then, O
again, O
I O
have O
heard O
it O
is O
no O
use O
your O
applying O
if O
your O
hair O
is O
light O
red, O
or O
dark O
red, O
or O
anything O
but O
real O
bright, O
blazing, O
fiery O
red. O
Now, O
if O
you O
cared O
to O
apply, O
Mr. O
Wilson, O
you O
would O
just O
walk O
in; O
but O
perhaps O
it O
would O
hardly O
be O
worth O
your O
while O
to O
put O
yourself O
out O
of O
the O
way O
for O
the O
sake O
of O
a O
few O
hundred O
pounds.' O
 O
Now, O
it O
is O
a O
fact, O
gentlemen, O
as O
you O
may O
see O
for O
yourselves, O
that O
my O
hair O
is O
of O
a O
very O
full O
and O
rich O
tint, O
so O
that O
it O
seemed O
to O
me O
that O
if O
there O
was O
to O
be O
any O
competition O
in O
the O
matter O
I O
stood O
as O
good O
a O
chance O
as O
any O
man O
that O
I O
had O
ever O
met. O
Vincent O
Spaulding O
seemed O
to O
know O
so O
much O
about O
it O
that O
I O
thought O
he O
might O
prove O
useful, O
so O
I O
just O
ordered O
him O
to O
put O
up O
the O
shutters O
for O
the O
day O
and O
to O
come O
right O
away O
with O
me. O
He O
was O
very O
willing O
to O
have O
a O
holiday, O
so O
we O
shut O
the O
business O
up O
and O
started O
off O
for O
the O
address O
that O
was O
given O
us O
in O
the O
advertisement. O
 O
I O
never O
hope O
to O
see O
such O
a O
sight O
as O
that O
again, O
Mr. O
Holmes. O
From O
north, O
south, O
east, O
and O
west O
every O
man O
who O
had O
a O
shade O
of O
red O
in O
his O
hair O
had O
tramped O
into O
the O
city O
to O
answer O
the O
advertisement. O
Fleet O
Street O
was O
choked O
with O
red-headed O
folk, O
and O
Pope's O
Court O
looked O
like O
a O
coster's O
orange O
barrow. O
I O
should O
not O
have O
thought O
there O
were O
so O
many O
in O
the O
whole O
country O
as O
were O
brought O
together O
by O
that O
single O
advertisement. O
Every O
shade O
of O
colour O
they O
were-- O
straw, O
lemon, O
orange, O
brick, O
Irish-setter, O
liver, O
clay; O
but, O
as O
Spaulding O
said, O
there O
were O
not O
many O
who O
had O
the O
real O
vivid O
flame-coloured O
tint. O
When O
I O
saw O
how O
many O
were O
waiting, O
I O
would O
have O
given O
it O
up O
in O
despair; O
but O
Spaulding O
would O
not O
hear O
of O
it. O
How O
he O
did O
it O
I O
could O
not O
imagine, O
but O
he O
pushed O
and O
pulled O
and O
butted O
until O
he O
got O
me O
through O
the O
crowd, O
and O
right O
up O
to O
the O
steps O
which O
led O
to O
the O
office. O
There O
was O
a O
double O
stream O
upon O
the O
stair, O
some O
going O
up O
in O
hope, O
and O
some O
coming O
back O
dejected; O
but O
we O
wedged O
in O
as O
well O
as O
we O
could O
and O
soon O
found O
ourselves O
in O
the O
office." O
"Your O
experience O
has O
been O
a O
most O
entertaining O
one," O
remarked O
Holmes O
as O
his O
client O
paused O
and O
refreshed O
his O
memory O
with O
a O
huge O
pinch O
of O
snuff. O
"Pray O
continue O
your O
very O
interesting O
statement." O
"There O
was O
nothing O
in O
the O
office O
but O
a O
couple O
of O
wooden O
chairs O
and O
a O
deal O
table, O
behind O
which O
sat O
a O
small O
man O
with O
a O
head O
that O
was O
even O
redder O
than O
mine. O
He O
said O
a O
few O
words O
to O
each O
candidate O
as O
he O
came O
up, O
and O
then O
he O
always O
managed O
to O
find O
some O
fault O
in O
them O
which O
would O
disqualify O
them. O
Getting O
a O
vacancy O
did O
not O
seem O
to O
be O
such O
a O
very O
easy O
matter, O
after O
all. O
However, O
when O
our O
turn O
came O
the O
little O
man O
was O
much O
more O
favourable O
to O
me O
than O
to O
any O
of O
the O
others, O
and O
he O
closed O
the O
door O
as O
we O
entered, O
so O
that O
he O
might O
have O
a O
private O
word O
with O
us. O
 O
'This O
is O
Mr. O
Jabez O
Wilson,' O
said O
my O
assistant, O
'and O
he O
is O
willing O
to O
fill O
a O
vacancy O
in O
the O
League.' O
 O
'And O
he O
is O
admirably O
suited O
for O
it,' O
the O
other O
answered. O
'He O
has O
every O
requirement. O
I O
cannot O
recall O
when O
I O
have O
seen O
anything O
so O
fine.' O
He O
took O
a O
step O
backward, O
cocked O
his O
head O
on O
one O
side, O
and O
gazed O
at O
my O
hair O
until O
I O
felt O
quite O
bashful. O
Then O
suddenly O
he O
plunged O
forward, O
wrung O
my O
hand, O
and O
congratulated O
me O
warmly O
on O
my O
success. O
 O
'It O
would O
be O
injustice O
to O
hesitate,' O
said O
he. O
'You O
will, O
however, O
I O
am O
sure, O
excuse O
me O
for O
taking O
an O
obvious O
precaution.' O
With O
that O
he O
seized O
my O
hair O
in O
both O
his O
hands, O
and O
tugged O
until O
I O
yelled O
with O
the O
pain. O
'There O
is O
water O
in O
your O
eyes,' O
said O
he O
as O
he O
released O
me. O
'I O
perceive O
that O
all O
is O
as O
it O
should O
be. O
But O
we O
have O
to O
be O
careful, O
for O
we O
have O
twice O
been O
deceived O
by O
wigs O
and O
once O
by O
paint. O
I O
could O
tell O
you O
tales O
of O
cobbler's O
wax O
which O
would O
disgust O
you O
with O
human O
nature.' O
He O
stepped O
over O
to O
the O
window O
and O
shouted O
through O
it O
at O
the O
top O
of O
his O
voice O
that O
the O
vacancy O
was O
filled. O
A O
groan O
of O
disappointment O
came O
up O
from O
below, O
and O
the O
folk O
all O
trooped O
away O
in O
different O
directions O
until O
there O
was O
not O
a O
red-head O
to O
be O
seen O
except O
my O
own O
and O
that O
of O
the O
manager. O
 O
'My O
name,' O
said O
he, O
'is O
Mr. O
Duncan O
Ross, O
and O
I O
am O
myself O
one O
of O
the O
pensioners O
upon O
the O
fund O
left O
by O
our O
noble O
benefactor. O
Are O
you O
a O
married O
man, O
Mr. O
Wilson? O
Have O
you O
a O
family?' O
 O
I O
answered O
that O
I O
had O
not. O
 O
His O
face O
fell O
immediately. O
 O
'Dear O
me!' O
he O
said O
gravely, O
'that O
is O
very O
serious O
indeed! O
I O
am O
sorry O
to O
hear O
you O
say O
that. O
The O
fund O
was, O
of O
course, O
for O
the O
propagation O
and O
spread O
of O
the O
red-heads O
as O
well O
as O
for O
their O
maintenance. O
It O
is O
exceedingly O
unfortunate O
that O
you O
should O
be O
a O
bachelor.' O
 O
My O
face O
lengthened O
at O
this, O
Mr. O
Holmes, O
for O
I O
thought O
that O
I O
was O
not O
to O
have O
the O
vacancy O
after O
all; O
but O
after O
thinking O
it O
over O
for O
a O
few O
minutes O
he O
said O
that O
it O
would O
be O
all O
right. O
 O
'In O
the O
case O
of O
another,' O
said O
he, O
'the O
objection O
might O
be O
fatal, O
but O
we O
must O
stretch O
a O
point O
in O
favour O
of O
a O
man O
with O
such O
a O
head O
of O
hair O
as O
yours. O
When O
shall O
you O
be O
able O
to O
enter O
upon O
your O
new O
duties?' O
 O
'Well, O
it O
is O
a O
little O
awkward, O
for O
I O
have O
a O
business O
already,' O
said O
I. O
'Oh, O
never O
mind O
about O
that, O
Mr. O
Wilson!' O
said O
Vincent O
Spaulding. O
'I O
should O
be O
able O
to O
look O
after O
that O
for O
you.' O
 O
'What O
would O
be O
the O
hours?' O
I O
asked. O
 O
'Ten O
to O
two.' O
 O
Now O
a O
pawnbroker's O
business O
is O
mostly O
done O
of O
an O
evening, O
Mr. O
Holmes, O
especially O
Thursday O
and O
Friday O
evening, O
which O
is O
just O
before O
pay-day; O
so O
it O
would O
suit O
me O
very O
well O
to O
earn O
a O
little O
in O
the O
mornings. O
Besides, O
I O
knew O
that O
my O
assistant O
was O
a O
good O
man, O
and O
that O
he O
would O
see O
to O
anything O
that O
turned O
up. O
 O
'That O
would O
suit O
me O
very O
well,' O
said O
I. O
'And O
the O
pay?' O
 O
'Is O
4 O
pounds O
a O
week.' O
 O
'And O
the O
work?' O
 O
'Is O
purely O
nominal.' O
 O
'What O
do O
you O
call O
purely O
nominal?' O
 O
'Well, O
you O
have O
to O
be O
in O
the O
office, O
or O
at O
least O
in O
the O
building, O
the O
whole O
time. O
If O
you O
leave, O
you O
forfeit O
your O
whole O
position O
forever. O
The O
will O
is O
very O
clear O
upon O
that O
point. O
You O
don't O
comply O
with O
the O
conditions O
if O
you O
budge O
from O
the O
office O
during O
that O
time.' O
 O
'It's O
only O
four O
hours O
a O
day, O
and O
I O
should O
not O
think O
of O
leaving,' O
said O
I. O
'No O
excuse O
will O
avail,' O
said O
Mr. O
Duncan O
Ross; O
'neither O
sickness O
nor O
business O
nor O
anything O
else. O
There O
you O
must O
stay, O
or O
you O
lose O
your O
billet.' O
 O
'And O
the O
work?' O
 O
'Is O
to O
copy O
out O
the O
"Encyclopaedia O
Britannica." O
There O
is O
the O
first O
volume O
of O
it O
in O
that O
press. O
You O
must O
find O
your O
own O
ink, O
pens, O
and O
blotting-paper, O
but O
we O
provide O
this O
table O
and O
chair. O
Will O
you O
be O
ready O
to-morrow?' O
 O
'Certainly,' O
I O
answered. O
 O
'Then, O
good-bye, O
Mr. O
Jabez O
Wilson, O
and O
let O
me O
congratulate O
you O
once O
more O
on O
the O
important O
position O
which O
you O
have O
been O
fortunate O
enough O
to O
gain.' O
He O
bowed O
me O
out O
of O
the O
room O
and O
I O
went O
home O
with O
my O
assistant, O
hardly O
knowing O
what O
to O
say O
or O
do, O
I O
was O
so O
pleased O
at O
my O
own O
good O
fortune. O
 O
Well, O
I O
thought O
over O
the O
matter O
all O
day, O
and O
by O
evening O
I O
was O
in O
low O
spirits O
again; O
for O
I O
had O
quite O
persuaded O
myself O
that O
the O
whole O
affair O
must O
be O
some O
great O
hoax O
or O
fraud, O
though O
what O
its O
object O
might O
be O
I O
could O
not O
imagine. O
It O
seemed O
altogether O
past O
belief O
that O
anyone O
could O
make O
such O
a O
will, O
or O
that O
they O
would O
pay O
such O
a O
sum O
for O
doing O
anything O
so O
simple O
as O
copying O
out O
the O
'Encyclopaedia O
Britannica.' O
Vincent O
Spaulding O
did O
what O
he O
could O
to O
cheer O
me O
up, O
but O
by O
bedtime O
I O
had O
reasoned O
myself O
out O
of O
the O
whole O
thing. O
However, O
in O
the O
morning O
I O
determined O
to O
have O
a O
look O
at O
it O
anyhow, O
so O
I O
bought O
a O
penny O
bottle O
of O
ink, O
and O
with O
a O
quill-pen, O
and O
seven O
sheets O
of O
foolscap O
paper, O
I O
started O
off O
for O
Pope's O
Court. O
 O
Well, O
to O
my O
surprise O
and O
delight, O
everything O
was O
as O
right O
as O
possible. O
The O
table O
was O
set O
out O
ready O
for O
me, O
and O
Mr. O
Duncan O
Ross O
was O
there O
to O
see O
that O
I O
got O
fairly O
to O
work. O
He O
started O
me O
off O
upon O
the O
letter O
A, O
and O
then O
he O
left O
me; O
but O
he O
would O
drop O
in O
from O
time O
to O
time O
to O
see O
that O
all O
was O
right O
with O
me. O
At O
two O
o'clock O
he O
bade O
me O
good-day, O
complimented O
me O
upon O
the O
amount O
that O
I O
had O
written, O
and O
locked O
the O
door O
of O
the O
office O
after O
me. O
 O
This O
went O
on O
day O
after O
day, O
Mr. O
Holmes, O
and O
on O
Saturday O
the O
manager O
came O
in O
and O
planked O
down O
four O
golden O
sovereigns O
for O
my O
week's O
work. O
It O
was O
the O
same O
next O
week, O
and O
the O
same O
the O
week O
after. O
Every O
morning O
I O
was O
there O
at O
ten, O
and O
every O
afternoon O
I O
left O
at O
two. O
By O
degrees O
Mr. O
Duncan O
Ross O
took O
to O
coming O
in O
only O
once O
of O
a O
morning, O
and O
then, O
after O
a O
time, O
he O
did O
not O
come O
in O
at O
all. O
Still, O
of O
course, O
I O
never O
dared O
to O
leave O
the O
room O
for O
an O
instant, O
for O
I O
was O
not O
sure O
when O
he O
might O
come, O
and O
the O
billet O
was O
such O
a O
good O
one, O
and O
suited O
me O
so O
well, O
that O
I O
would O
not O
risk O
the O
loss O
of O
it. O
 O
Eight O
weeks O
passed O
away O
like O
this, O
and O
I O
had O
written O
about O
Abbots O
and O
Archery O
and O
Armour O
and O
Architecture O
and O
Attica, O
and O
hoped O
with O
diligence O
that O
I O
might O
get O
on O
to O
the O
B's O
before O
very O
long. O
It O
cost O
me O
something O
in O
foolscap, O
and O
I O
had O
pretty O
nearly O
filled O
a O
shelf O
with O
my O
writings. O
And O
then O
suddenly O
the O
whole O
business O
came O
to O
an O
end." O
"To O
an O
end?" O
"Yes, O
sir. O
And O
no O
later O
than O
this O
morning. O
I O
went O
to O
my O
work O
as O
usual O
at O
ten O
o'clock, O
but O
the O
door O
was O
shut O
and O
locked, O
with O
a O
little O
square O
of O
cardboard O
hammered O
on O
to O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
panel O
with O
a O
tack. O
Here O
it O
is, O
and O
you O
can O
read O
for O
yourself." O
He O
held O
up O
a O
piece O
of O
white O
cardboard O
about O
the O
size O
of O
a O
sheet O
of O
note-paper. O
It O
read O
in O
this O
fashion: O
THE O
RED-HEADED O
LEAGUE O
IS O
DISSOLVED. O
 O
October O
9, O
1890. O
Sherlock O
Holmes O
and O
I O
surveyed O
this O
curt O
announcement O
and O
the O
rueful O
face O
behind O
it, O
until O
the O
comical O
side O
of O
the O
affair O
so O
completely O
overtopped O
every O
other O
consideration O
that O
we O
both O
burst O
out O
into O
a O
roar O
of O
laughter. O
"I O
cannot O
see O
that O
there O
is O
anything O
very O
funny," O
cried O
our O
client, O
flushing O
up O
to O
the O
roots O
of O
his O
flaming O
head. O
"If O
you O
can O
do O
nothing O
better O
than O
laugh O
at O
me, O
I O
can O
go O
elsewhere." O
"No, O
no," O
cried O
Holmes, O
shoving O
him O
back O
into O
the O
chair O
from O
which O
he O
had O
half O
risen. O
"I O
really O
wouldn't O
miss O
your O
case O
for O
the O
world. O
It O
is O
most O
refreshingly O
unusual. O
But O
there O
is, O
if O
you O
will O
excuse O
my O
saying O
so, O
something O
just O
a O
little O
funny O
about O
it. O
Pray O
what O
steps O
did O
you O
take O
when O
you O
found O
the O
card O
upon O
the O
door?" O
"I O
was O
staggered, O
sir. O
I O
did O
not O
know O
what O
to O
do. O
Then O
I O
called O
at O
the O
offices O
round, O
but O
none O
of O
them O
seemed O
to O
know O
anything O
about O
it. O
Finally, O
I O
went O
to O
the O
landlord, O
who O
is O
an O
accountant O
living O
on O
the O
ground-floor, O
and O
I O
asked O
him O
if O
he O
could O
tell O
me O
what O
had O
become O
of O
the O
Red-headed O
League. O
He O
said O
that O
he O
had O
never O
heard O
of O
any O
such O
body. O
Then O
I O
asked O
him O
who O
Mr. O
Duncan O
Ross O
was. O
He O
answered O
that O
the O
name O
was O
new O
to O
him. O
 O
'Well,' O
said O
I, O
'the O
gentleman O
at O
No. O
4.' O
 O
'What, O
the O
red-headed O
man?' O
 O
'Yes.' O
 O
'Oh,' O
said O
he, O
'his O
name O
was O
William O
Morris. O
He O
was O
a O
solicitor O
and O
was O
using O
my O
room O
as O
a O
temporary O
convenience O
until O
his O
new O
premises O
were O
ready. O
He O
moved O
out O
yesterday.' O
 O
'Where O
could O
I O
find O
him?' O
 O
'Oh, O
at O
his O
new O
offices. O
He O
did O
tell O
me O
the O
address. O
Yes, O
17 O
King O
Edward O
Street, O
near O
St. O
Paul's.' O
 O
I O
started O
off, O
Mr. O
Holmes, O
but O
when O
I O
got O
to O
that O
address O
it O
was O
a O
manufactory O
of O
artificial O
knee-caps, O
and O
no O
one O
in O
it O
had O
ever O
heard O
of O
either O
Mr. O
William O
Morris O
or O
Mr. O
Duncan O
Ross." O
"And O
what O
did O
you O
do O
then?" O
asked O
Holmes. O
"I O
went O
home O
to O
Saxe-Coburg O
Square, O
and O
I O
took O
the O
advice O
of O
my O
assistant. O
But O
he O
could O
not O
help O
me O
in O
any O
way. O
He O
could O
only O
say O
that O
if O
I O
waited O
I O
should O
hear O
by O
post. O
But O
that O
was O
not O
quite O
good O
enough, O
Mr. O
Holmes. O
I O
did O
not O
wish O
to O
lose O
such O
a O
place O
without O
a O
struggle, O
so, O
as O
I O
had O
heard O
that O
you O
were O
good O
enough O
to O
give O
advice O
to O
poor O
folk O
who O
were O
in O
need O
of O
it, O
I O
came O
right O
away O
to O
you." O
"And O
you O
did O
very O
wisely," O
said O
Holmes. O
"Your O
case O
is O
an O
exceedingly O
remarkable O
one, O
and O
I O
shall O
be O
happy O
to O
look O
into O
it. O
From O
what O
you O
have O
told O
me O
I O
think O
that O
it O
is O
possible O
that O
graver O
issues O
hang O
from O
it O
than O
might O
at O
first O
sight O
appear." O
"Grave O
enough!" O
said O
Mr. O
Jabez O
Wilson. O
"Why, O
I O
have O
lost O
four O
pound O
a O
week." O
"As O
far O
as O
you O
are O
personally O
concerned," O
remarked O
Holmes, O
"I O
do O
not O
see O
that O
you O
have O
any O
grievance O
against O
this O
extraordinary O
league. O
On O
the O
contrary, O
you O
are, O
as O
I O
understand, O
richer O
byDONEDET35630 O
pounds, O
to O
say O
nothing O
of O
the O
minute O
knowledge O
which O
you O
have O
gained O
on O
every O
subject O
which O
comes O
under O
the O
letter O
A. O
You O
have O
lost O
nothing O
by O
them." O
"No, O
sir. O
But O
I O
want O
to O
find O
out O
about O
them, O
and O
who O
they O
are, O
and O
what O
their O
object O
was O
in O
playing O
this O
prank-- O
if O
it O
was O
a O
prank-- O
upon O
me. O
It O
was O
a O
pretty O
expensive O
joke O
for O
them, O
for O
it O
cost O
them O
two O
and O
thirty O
pounds." O
"We O
shall O
endeavour O
to O
clear O
up O
these O
points O
for O
you. O
And, O
first, O
one O
or O
two O
questions, O
Mr. O
Wilson. O
This O
assistant O
of O
yours O
who O
first O
called O
your O
attention O
to O
the O
advertisement-- O
how O
long O
had O
he O
been O
with O
you?" O
"About O
a O
month O
then." O
"How O
did O
he O
come?" O
"In O
answer O
to O
an O
advertisement." O
"Was O
he O
the O
only O
applicant?" O
"No, O
I O
had O
a O
dozen." O
"Why O
did O
you O
pick O
him?" O
"Because O
he O
was O
handy O
and O
would O
come O
cheap." O
"At O
half-wages, O
in O
fact." O
"Yes." O
"What O
is O
he O
like, O
this O
Vincent O
Spaulding?" O
"Small, O
stout-built, O
very O
quick O
in O
his O
ways, O
no O
hair O
on O
his O
face, O
though O
he's O
not O
short O
of O
thirty. O
Has O
a O
white O
splash O
of O
acid O
upon O
his O
forehead." O
Holmes O
sat O
up O
in O
his O
chair O
in O
considerable O
excitement. O
"I O
thought O
as O
much," O
said O
he. O
"Have O
you O
ever O
observed O
that O
his O
ears O
are O
pierced O
for O
earrings?" O
"Yes, O
sir. O
He O
told O
me O
that O
a O
gipsy O
had O
done O
it O
for O
him O
when O
he O
was O
a O
lad." O
"Hum!" O
said O
Holmes, O
sinking O
back O
in O
deep O
thought. O
"He O
is O
still O
with O
you?" O
"Oh, O
yes, O
sir; O
I O
have O
only O
just O
left O
him." O
"And O
has O
your O
business O
been O
attended O
to O
in O
your O
absence?" O
"Nothing O
to O
complain O
of, O
sir. O
There's O
never O
very O
much O
to O
do O
of O
a O
morning." O
"That O
will O
do, O
Mr. O
Wilson. O
I O
shall O
be O
happy O
to O
give O
you O
an O
opinion O
upon O
the O
subject O
in O
the O
course O
of O
a O
day O
or O
two. O
To-day O
is O
Saturday, O
and O
I O
hope O
that O
by O
Monday O
we O
may O
come O
to O
a O
conclusion." O
"Well, O
Watson," O
said O
Holmes O
when O
our O
visitor O
had O
left O
us, O
"what O
do O
you O
make O
of O
it O
all?" O
"I O
make O
nothing O
of O
it," O
I O
answered O
frankly. O
"It O
is O
a O
most O
mysterious O
business." O
"As O
a O
rule," O
said O
Holmes, O
"the O
more O
bizarre O
a O
thing O
is O
the O
less O
mysterious O
it O
proves O
to O
be. O
It O
is O
your O
commonplace, O
featureless O
crimes O
which O
are O
really O
puzzling, O
just O
as O
a O
commonplace O
face O
is O
the O
most O
difficult O
to O
identify. O
But O
I O
must O
be O
prompt O
over O
this O
matter." O
"What O
are O
you O
going O
to O
do, O
then?" O
I O
asked. O
"To O
smoke," O
he O
answered. O
"It O
is O
quite O
a O
three O
pipe O
problem, O
and O
I O
beg O
that O
you O
won't O
speak O
to O
me O
for O
fifty O
minutes." O
He O
curled O
himself O
up O
in O
his O
chair, O
with O
his O
thin O
knees O
drawn O
up O
to O
his O
hawk-like O
nose, O
and O
there O
he O
sat O
with O
his O
eyes O
closed O
and O
his O
black O
clay O
pipe O
thrusting O
out O
like O
the O
bill O
of O
some O
strange O
bird. O
I O
had O
come O
to O
the O
conclusion O
that O
he O
had O
dropped O
asleep, O
and O
indeed O
was O
nodding O
myself, O
when O
he O
suddenly O
sprang O
out O
of O
his O
chair O
with O
the O
gesture O
of O
a O
man O
who O
has O
made O
up O
his O
mind O
and O
put O
his O
pipe O
down O
upon O
the O
mantelpiece. O
"Sarasate O
plays O
at O
the O
St. O
James's O
Hall O
this O
afternoon," O
he O
remarked. O
"What O
do O
you O
think, O
Watson? O
Could O
your O
patients O
spare O
you O
for O
a O
few O
hours?" O
"I O
have O
nothing O
to O
do O
to-day. O
My O
practice O
is O
never O
very O
absorbing." O
"Then O
put O
on O
your O
hat O
and O
come. O
I O
am O
going O
through O
the O
City O
first, O
and O
we O
can O
have O
some O
lunch O
on O
the O
way. O
I O
observe O
that O
there O
is O
a O
good O
deal O
of O
German O
music O
on O
the O
programme, O
which O
is O
rather O
more O
to O
my O
taste O
than O
Italian O
or O
French. O
It O
is O
introspective, O
and O
I O
want O
to O
introspect. O
Come O
along!" O
We O
travelled O
by O
the O
Underground O
as O
far O
as O
Aldersgate; O
and O
a O
short O
walk O
took O
us O
to O
Saxe-Coburg O
Square, O
the O
scene O
of O
the O
singular O
story O
which O
we O
had O
listened O
to O
in O
the O
morning. O
It O
was O
a O
poky, O
little, O
shabby-genteel O
place, O
where O
four O
lines O
of O
dingy O
two-storied O
brick O
houses O
looked O
out O
into O
a O
small O
railed-in O
enclosure, O
where O
a O
lawn O
of O
weedy O
grass O
and O
a O
few O
clumps O
of O
faded O
laurel-bushes O
made O
a O
hard O
fight O
against O
a O
smoke-laden O
and O
uncongenial O
atmosphere. O
Three O
gilt O
balls O
and O
a O
brown O
board O
with O
"JABEZ O
WILSON" O
in O
white O
letters, O
upon O
a O
corner O
house, O
announced O
the O
place O
where O
our O
red-headed O
client O
carried O
on O
his O
business. O
Sherlock O
Holmes O
stopped O
in O
front O
of O
it O
with O
his O
head O
on O
one O
side O
and O
looked O
it O
all O
over, O
with O
his O
eyes O
shining O
brightly O
between O
puckered O
lids. O
Then O
he O
walked O
slowly O
up O
the O
street, O
and O
then O
down O
again O
to O
the O
corner, O
still O
looking O
keenly O
at O
the O
houses. O
Finally O
he O
returned O
to O
the O
pawnbroker's, O
and, O
having O
thumped O
vigorously O
upon O
the O
pavement O
with O
his O
stick O
two O
or O
three O
times, O
he O
went O
up O
to O
the O
door O
and O
knocked. O
It O
was O
instantly O
opened O
by O
a O
bright-looking, O
clean-shaven O
young O
fellow, O
who O
asked O
him O
to O
step O
in. O
"Thank O
you," O
said O
Holmes, O
"I O
only O
wished O
to O
ask O
you O
how O
you O
would O
go O
from O
here O
to O
the O
Strand." O
"Third O
right, O
fourth O
left," O
answered O
the O
assistant O
promptly, O
closing O
the O
door. O
"Smart O
fellow, O
that," O
observed O
Holmes O
as O
we O
walked O
away. O
"He O
is, O
in O
my O
judgment, O
the O
fourth O
smartest O
man O
in O
London, O
and O
for O
daring O
I O
am O
not O
sure O
that O
he O
has O
not O
a O
claim O
to O
be O
third. O
I O
have O
known O
something O
of O
him O
before." O
"Evidently," O
said O
I, O
"Mr. O
Wilson's O
assistant O
counts O
for O
a O
good O
deal O
in O
this O
mystery O
of O
the O
Red-headed O
League. O
I O
am O
sure O
that O
you O
inquired O
your O
way O
merely O
in O
order O
that O
you O
might O
see O
him." O
"Not O
him." O
"What O
then?" O
"The O
knees O
of O
his O
trousers." O
"And O
what O
did O
you O
see?" O
"What O
I O
expected O
to O
see." O
"Why O
did O
you O
beat O
the O
pavement?" O
"My O
dear O
doctor, O
this O
is O
a O
time O
for O
observation, O
not O
for O
talk. O
We O
are O
spies O
in O
an O
enemy's O
country. O
We O
know O
something O
of O
Saxe-Coburg O
Square. O
Let O
us O
now O
explore O
the O
parts O
which O
lie O
behind O
it." O
The O
road O
in O
which O
we O
found O
ourselves O
as O
we O
turned O
round O
the O
corner O
from O
the O
retired O
Saxe-Coburg O
Square O
presented O
as O
great O
a O
contrast O
to O
it O
as O
the O
front O
of O
a O
picture O
does O
to O
the O
back. O
It O
was O
one O
of O
the O
main O
arteries O
which O
conveyed O
the O
traffic O
of O
the O
City O
to O
the O
north O
and O
west. O
The O
roadway O
was O
blocked O
with O
the O
immense O
stream O
of O
commerce O
flowing O
in O
a O
double O
tide O
inward O
and O
outward, O
while O
the O
footpaths O
were O
black O
with O
the O
hurrying O
swarm O
of O
pedestrians. O
It O
was O
difficult O
to O
realise O
as O
we O
looked O
at O
the O
line O
of O
fine O
shops O
and O
stately O
business O
premises O
that O
they O
really O
abutted O
on O
the O
other O
side O
upon O
the O
faded O
and O
stagnant O
square O
which O
we O
had O
just O
quitted. O
"Let O
me O
see," O
said O
Holmes, O
standing O
at O
the O
corner O
and O
glancing O
along O
the O
line, O
"I O
should O
like O
just O
to O
remember O
the O
order O
of O
the O
houses O
here. O
It O
is O
a O
hobby O
of O
mine O
to O
have O
an O
exact O
knowledge O
of O
London. O
There O
is O
Mortimer's, O
the O
tobacconist, O
the O
little O
newspaper O
shop, O
the O
Coburg O
branch O
of O
the O
City O
and O
Suburban O
Bank, O
the O
Vegetarian O
Restaurant, O
and O
McFarlane's O
carriage-building O
depot. O
That O
carries O
us O
right O
on O
to O
the O
other O
block. O
And O
now, O
Doctor, O
we've O
done O
our O
work, O
so O
it's O
time O
we O
had O
some O
play. O
A O
sandwich O
and O
a O
cup O
of O
coffee, O
and O
then O
off O
to O
violin-land, O
where O
all O
is O
sweetness O
and O
delicacy O
and O
harmony, O
and O
there O
are O
no O
red-headed O
clients O
to O
vex O
us O
with O
their O
conundrums." O
My O
friend O
was O
an O
enthusiastic O
musician, O
being O
himself O
not O
only O
a O
very O
capable O
performer O
but O
a O
composer O
of O
no O
ordinary O
merit. O
All O
the O
afternoon O
he O
sat O
in O
the O
stalls O
wrapped O
in O
the O
most O
perfect O
happiness, O
gently O
waving O
his O
long, O
thin O
fingers O
in O
time O
to O
the O
music, O
while O
his O
gently O
smiling O
face O
and O
his O
languid, O
dreamy O
eyes O
were O
as O
unlike O
those O
of O
Holmes O
the O
sleuth-hound, O
Holmes O
the O
relentless, O
keen-witted, O
ready-handed O
criminal O
agent, O
as O
it O
was O
possible O
to O
conceive. O
In O
his O
singular O
character O
the O
dual O
nature O
alternately O
asserted O
itself, O
and O
his O
extreme O
exactness O
and O
astuteness O
represented, O
as O
I O
have O
often O
thought, O
the O
reaction O
against O
the O
poetic O
and O
contemplative O
mood O
which O
occasionally O
predominated O
in O
him. O
The O
swing O
of O
his O
nature O
took O
him O
from O
extreme O
languor O
to O
devouring O
energy; O
and, O
as O
I O
knew O
well, O
he O
was O
never O
so O
truly O
formidable O
as O
when, O
for O
days O
on O
end, O
he O
had O
been O
lounging O
in O
his O
armchair O
amid O
his O
improvisations O
and O
his O
black-letter O
editions. O
Then O
it O
was O
that O
the O
lust O
of O
the O
chase O
would O
suddenly O
come O
upon O
him, O
and O
that O
his O
brilliant O
reasoning O
power O
would O
rise O
to O
the O
level O
of O
intuition, O
until O
those O
who O
were O
unacquainted O
with O
his O
methods O
would O
look O
askance O
at O
him O
as O
on O
a O
man O
whose O
knowledge O
was O
not O
that O
of O
other O
mortals. O
When O
I O
saw O
him O
that O
afternoon O
so O
enwrapped O
in O
the O
music O
at O
St. O
James's O
Hall O
I O
felt O
that O
an O
evil O
time O
might O
be O
coming O
upon O
those O
whom O
he O
had O
set O
himself O
to O
hunt O
down. O
"You O
want O
to O
go O
home, O
no O
doubt, O
Doctor," O
he O
remarked O
as O
we O
emerged. O
"Yes, O
it O
would O
be O
as O
well." O
"And O
I O
have O
some O
business O
to O
do O
which O
will O
take O
some O
hours. O
This O
business O
at O
Coburg O
Square O
is O
serious." O
"Why O
serious?" O
"A O
considerable O
crime O
is O
in O
contemplation. O
I O
have O
every O
reason O
to O
believe O
that O
we O
shall O
be O
in O
time O
to O
stop O
it. O
But O
to-day O
being O
Saturday O
rather O
complicates O
matters. O
I O
shall O
want O
your O
help O
to-night." O
"At O
what O
time?" O
"Ten O
will O
be O
early O
enough." O
"I O
shall O
be O
at O
Baker O
Street O
at O
ten." O
"Very O
well. O
And, O
I O
say, O
Doctor, O
there O
may O
be O
some O
little O
danger, O
so O
kindly O
put O
your O
army O
revolver O
in O
your O
pocket." O
He O
waved O
his O
hand, O
turned O
on O
his O
heel, O
and O
disappeared O
in O
an O
instant O
among O
the O
crowd. O
I O
trust O
that O
I O
am O
not O
more O
dense O
than O
my O
neighbours, O
but O
I O
was O
always O
oppressed O
with O
a O
sense O
of O
my O
own O
stupidity O
in O
my O
dealings O
with O
Sherlock O
Holmes. O
Here O
I O
had O
heard O
what O
he O
had O
heard, O
I O
had O
seen O
what O
he O
had O
seen, O
and O
yet O
from O
his O
words O
it O
was O
evident O
that O
he O
saw O
clearly O
not O
only O
what O
had O
happened O
but O
what O
was O
about O
to O
happen, O
while O
to O
me O
the O
whole O
business O
was O
still O
confused O
and O
grotesque. O
As O
I O
drove O
home O
to O
my O
house O
in O
Kensington O
I O
thought O
over O
it O
all, O
from O
the O
extraordinary O
story O
of O
the O
red-headed O
copier O
of O
the O
"Encyclopaedia" O
down O
to O
the O
visit O
to O
Saxe-Coburg O
Square, O
and O
the O
ominous O
words O
with O
which O
he O
had O
parted O
from O
me. O
What O
was O
this O
nocturnal O
expedition, O
and O
why O
should O
I O
go O
armed? O
Where O
were O
we O
going, O
and O
what O
were O
we O
to O
do? O
I O
had O
the O
hint O
from O
Holmes O
that O
this O
smooth-faced O
pawnbroker's O
assistant O
was O
a O
formidable O
man--a O
man O
who O
might O
play O
a O
deep O
game. O
I O
tried O
to O
puzzle O
it O
out, O
but O
gave O
it O
up O
in O
despair O
and O
set O
the O
matter O
aside O
until O
night O
should O
bring O
an O
explanation. O
It O
was O
a O
quarter-past O
nine O
when O
I O
started O
from O
home O
and O
made O
my O
way O
across O
the O
Park, O
and O
so O
through O
Oxford O
Street O
to O
Baker O
Street. O
Two O
hansoms O
were O
standing O
at O
the O
door, O
and O
as O
I O
entered O
the O
passage O
I O
heard O
the O
sound O
of O
voices O
from O
above. O
On O
entering O
his O
room O
I O
found O
Holmes O
in O
animated O
conversation O
with O
two O
men, O
one O
of O
whom O
I O
recognised O
as O
Peter O
Jones, O
the O
official O
police O
agent, O
while O
the O
other O
was O
a O
long, O
thin, O
sad-faced O
man, O
with O
a O
very O
shiny O
hat O
and O
oppressively O
respectable O
frock-coat. O
"Ha! O
Our O
party O
is O
complete," O
said O
Holmes, O
buttoning O
up O
his O
pea-jacket O
and O
taking O
his O
heavy O
hunting O
crop O
from O
the O
rack. O
"Watson, O
I O
think O
you O
know O
Mr. O
Jones, O
of O
Scotland O
Yard? O
Let O
me O
introduce O
you O
to O
Mr. O
Merryweather, O
who O
is O
to O
be O
our O
companion O
in O
to-night's O
adventure." O
"We're O
hunting O
in O
couples O
again, O
Doctor, O
you O
see," O
said O
Jones O
in O
his O
consequential O
way. O
"Our O
friend O
here O
is O
a O
wonderful O
man O
for O
starting O
a O
chase. O
All O
he O
wants O
is O
an O
old O
dog O
to O
help O
him O
to O
do O
the O
running O
down." O
"I O
hope O
a O
wild O
goose O
may O
not O
prove O
to O
be O
the O
end O
of O
our O
chase," O
observed O
Mr. O
Merryweather O
gloomily. O
"You O
may O
place O
considerable O
confidence O
in O
Mr. O
Holmes, O
sir," O
said O
the O
police O
agent O
loftily. O
"He O
has O
his O
own O
little O
methods, O
which O
are, O
if O
he O
won't O
mind O
my O
saying O
so, O
just O
a O
little O
too O
theoretical O
and O
fantastic, O
but O
he O
has O
the O
makings O
of O
a O
detective O
in O
him. O
It O
is O
not O
too O
much O
to O
say O
that O
once O
or O
twice, O
as O
in O
that O
business O
of O
the O
Sholto O
murder O
and O
the O
Agra O
treasure, O
he O
has O
been O
more O
nearly O
correct O
than O
the O
official O
force." O
"Oh, O
if O
you O
say O
so, O
Mr. O
Jones, O
it O
is O
all O
right," O
said O
the O
stranger O
with O
deference. O
"Still, O
I O
confess O
that O
I O
miss O
my O
rubber. O
It O
is O
the O
first O
Saturday O
night O
for O
seven-and-twenty O
years O
that O
I O
have O
not O
had O
my O
rubber." O
"I O
think O
you O
will O
find," O
said O
Sherlock O
Holmes, O
"that O
you O
will O
play O
for O
a O
higher O
stake O
to-night O
than O
you O
have O
ever O
done O
yet, O
and O
that O
the O
play O
will O
be O
more O
exciting. O
For O
you, O
Mr. O
Merryweather, O
the O
stake O
will O
beDONEDET53930,000 O
pounds; O
and O
for O
you, O
Jones, O
it O
will O
be O
the O
man O
upon O
whom O
you O
wish O
to O
lay O
your O
hands." O
"John O
Clay, O
the O
murderer, O
thief, O
smasher, O
and O
forger. O
He's O
a O
young O
man, O
Mr. O
Merryweather, O
but O
he O
is O
at O
the O
head O
of O
his O
profession, O
and O
I O
would O
rather O
have O
my O
bracelets O
on O
him O
than O
on O
any O
criminal O
in O
London. O
He's O
a O
remarkable O
man, O
is O
young O
John O
Clay. O
His O
grandfather O
was O
a O
royal O
duke, O
and O
he O
himself O
has O
been O
to O
Eton O
and O
Oxford. O
His O
brain O
is O
as O
cunning O
as O
his O
fingers, O
and O
though O
we O
meet O
signs O
of O
him O
at O
every O
turn, O
we O
never O
know O
where O
to O
find O
the O
man O
himself. O
He'll O
crack O
a O
crib O
in O
Scotland O
one O
week, O
and O
be O
raising O
money O
to O
build O
an O
orphanage O
in O
Cornwall O
the O
next. O
I've O
been O
on O
his O
track O
for O
years O
and O
have O
never O
set O
eyes O
on O
him O
yet." O
"I O
hope O
that O
I O
may O
have O
the O
pleasure O
of O
introducing O
you O
to-night. O
I've O
had O
one O
or O
two O
little O
turns O
also O
with O
Mr. O
John O
Clay, O
and O
I O
agree O
with O
you O
that O
he O
is O
at O
the O
head O
of O
his O
profession. O
It O
is O
past O
ten, O
however, O
and O
quite O
time O
that O
we O
started. O
If O
you O
two O
will O
take O
the O
first O
hansom, O
Watson O
and O
I O
will O
follow O
in O
the O
second." O
Sherlock O
Holmes O
was O
not O
very O
communicative O
during O
the O
long O
drive O
and O
lay O
back O
in O
the O
cab O
humming O
the O
tunes O
which O
he O
had O
heard O
in O
the O
afternoon. O
We O
rattled O
through O
an O
endless O
labyrinth O
of O
gas-lit O
streets O
until O
we O
emerged O
into O
Farrington O
Street. O
"We O
are O
close O
there O
now," O
my O
friend O
remarked. O
"This O
fellow O
Merryweather O
is O
a O
bank O
director, O
and O
personally O
interested O
in O
the O
matter. O
I O
thought O
it O
as O
well O
to O
have O
Jones O
with O
us O
also. O
He O
is O
not O
a O
bad O
fellow, O
though O
an O
absolute O
imbecile O
in O
his O
profession. O
He O
has O
one O
positive O
virtue. O
He O
is O
as O
brave O
as O
a O
bulldog O
and O
as O
tenacious O
as O
a O
lobster O
if O
he O
gets O
his O
claws O
upon O
anyone. O
Here O
we O
are, O
and O
they O
are O
waiting O
for O
us." O
We O
had O
reached O
the O
same O
crowded O
thoroughfare O
in O
which O
we O
had O
found O
ourselves O
in O
the O
morning. O
Our O
cabs O
were O
dismissed, O
and, O
following O
the O
guidance O
of O
Mr. O
Merryweather, O
we O
passed O
down O
a O
narrow O
passage O
and O
through O
a O
side O
door, O
which O
he O
opened O
for O
us. O
Within O
there O
was O
a O
small O
corridor, O
which O
ended O
in O
a O
very O
massive O
iron O
gate. O
This O
also O
was O
opened, O
and O
led O
down O
a O
flight O
of O
winding O
stone O
steps, O
which O
terminated O
at O
another O
formidable O
gate. O
Mr. O
Merryweather O
stopped O
to O
light O
a O
lantern, O
and O
then O
conducted O
us O
down O
a O
dark, O
earth-smelling O
passage, O
and O
so, O
after O
opening O
a O
third O
door, O
into O
a O
huge O
vault O
or O
cellar, O
which O
was O
piled O
all O
round O
with O
crates O
and O
massive O
boxes. O
"You O
are O
not O
very O
vulnerable O
from O
above," O
Holmes O
remarked O
as O
he O
held O
up O
the O
lantern O
and O
gazed O
about O
him. O
"Nor O
from O
below," O
said O
Mr. O
Merryweather, O
striking O
his O
stick O
upon O
the O
flags O
which O
lined O
the O
floor. O
"Why, O
dear O
me, O
it O
sounds O
quite O
hollow!" O
he O
remarked, O
looking O
up O
in O
surprise. O
"I O
must O
really O
ask O
you O
to O
be O
a O
little O
more O
quiet!" O
said O
Holmes O
severely. O
"You O
have O
already O
imperilled O
the O
whole O
success O
of O
our O
expedition. O
Might O
I O
beg O
that O
you O
would O
have O
the O
goodness O
to O
sit O
down O
upon O
one O
of O
those O
boxes, O
and O
not O
to O
interfere?" O
The O
solemn O
Mr. O
Merryweather O
perched O
himself O
upon O
a O
crate, O
with O
a O
very O
injured O
expression O
upon O
his O
face, O
while O
Holmes O
fell O
upon O
his O
knees O
upon O
the O
floor O
and, O
with O
the O
lantern O
and O
a O
magnifying O
lens, O
began O
to O
examine O
minutely O
the O
cracks O
between O
the O
stones. O
A O
few O
seconds O
sufficed O
to O
satisfy O
him, O
for O
he O
sprang O
to O
his O
feet O
again O
and O
put O
his O
glass O
in O
his O
pocket. O
"We O
have O
at O
least O
an O
hour O
before O
us," O
he O
remarked, O
"for O
they O
can O
hardly O
take O
any O
steps O
until O
the O
good O
pawnbroker O
is O
safely O
in O
bed. O
Then O
they O
will O
not O
lose O
a O
minute, O
for O
the O
sooner O
they O
do O
their O
work O
the O
longer O
time O
they O
will O
have O
for O
their O
escape. O
We O
are O
at O
present, O
Doctor-- O
as O
no O
doubt O
you O
have O
divined-- O
in O
the O
cellar O
of O
the O
City O
branch O
of O
one O
of O
the O
principal O
London O
banks. O
Mr. O
Merryweather O
is O
the O
chairman O
of O
directors, O
and O
he O
will O
explain O
to O
you O
that O
there O
are O
reasons O
why O
the O
more O
daring O
criminals O
of O
London O
should O
take O
a O
considerable O
interest O
in O
this O
cellar O
at O
present." O
"It O
is O
our O
French O
gold," O
whispered O
the O
director. O
"We O
have O
had O
several O
warnings O
that O
an O
attempt O
might O
be O
made O
upon O
it." O
"Your O
French O
gold?" O
"Yes. O
We O
had O
occasion O
some O
months O
ago O
to O
strengthen O
our O
resources O
and O
borrowed O
for O
that O
purpose O
30,000 O
napoleons O
from O
the O
Bank O
of O
France. O
It O
has O
become O
known O
that O
we O
have O
never O
had O
occasion O
to O
unpack O
the O
money, O
and O
that O
it O
is O
still O
lying O
in O
our O
cellar. O
The O
crate O
upon O
which O
I O
sit O
contains O
2,000 O
napoleons O
packed O
between O
layers O
of O
lead O
foil. O
Our O
reserve O
of O
bullion O
is O
much O
larger O
at O
present O
than O
is O
usually O
kept O
in O
a O
single O
branch O
office, O
and O
the O
directors O
have O
had O
misgivings O
upon O
the O
subject." O
"Which O
were O
very O
well O
justified," O
observed O
Holmes. O
"And O
now O
it O
is O
time O
that O
we O
arranged O
our O
little O
plans. O
I O
expect O
that O
within O
an O
hour O
matters O
will O
come O
to O
a O
head. O
In O
the O
meantime O
Mr. O
Merryweather, O
we O
must O
put O
the O
screen O
over O
that O
dark O
lantern." O
"And O
sit O
in O
the O
dark?" O
"I O
am O
afraid O
so. O
I O
had O
brought O
a O
pack O
of O
cards O
in O
my O
pocket, O
and O
I O
thought O
that, O
as O
we O
were O
a O
partie O
carrée, O
you O
might O
have O
your O
rubber O
after O
all. O
But O
I O
see O
that O
the O
enemy's O
preparations O
have O
gone O
so O
far O
that O
we O
cannot O
risk O
the O
presence O
of O
a O
light. O
And, O
first O
of O
all, O
we O
must O
choose O
our O
positions. O
These O
are O
daring O
men, O
and O
though O
we O
shall O
take O
them O
at O
a O
disadvantage, O
they O
may O
do O
us O
some O
harm O
unless O
we O
are O
careful. O
I O
shall O
stand O
behind O
this O
crate, O
and O
do O
you O
conceal O
yourselves O
behind O
those. O
Then, O
when O
I O
flash O
a O
light O
upon O
them, O
close O
in O
swiftly. O
If O
they O
fire, O
Watson, O
have O
no O
compunction O
about O
shooting O
them O
down." O
I O
placed O
my O
revolver, O
cocked, O
upon O
the O
top O
of O
the O
wooden O
case O
behind O
which O
I O
crouched. O
Holmes O
shot O
the O
slide O
across O
the O
front O
of O
his O
lantern O
and O
left O
us O
in O
pitch O
darkness-- O
such O
an O
absolute O
darkness O
as O
I O
have O
never O
before O
experienced. O
The O
smell O
of O
hot O
metal O
remained O
to O
assure O
us O
that O
the O
light O
was O
still O
there, O
ready O
to O
flash O
out O
at O
a O
moment's O
notice. O
To O
me, O
with O
my O
nerves O
worked O
up O
to O
a O
pitch O
of O
expectancy, O
there O
was O
something O
depressing O
and O
subduing O
in O
the O
sudden O
gloom, O
and O
in O
the O
cold O
dank O
air O
of O
the O
vault. O
"They O
have O
but O
one O
retreat," O
whispered O
Holmes. O
"That O
is O
back O
through O
the O
house O
into O
Saxe-Coburg O
Square. O
I O
hope O
that O
you O
have O
done O
what O
I O
asked O
you, O
Jones?" O
"I O
have O
an O
inspector O
and O
two O
officers O
waiting O
at O
the O
front O
door." O
"Then O
we O
have O
stopped O
all O
the O
holes. O
And O
now O
we O
must O
be O
silent O
and O
wait." O
What O
a O
time O
it O
seemed! O
From O
comparing O
notes O
afterwards O
it O
was O
but O
an O
hour O
and O
a O
quarter, O
yet O
it O
appeared O
to O
me O
that O
the O
night O
must O
have O
almost O
gone O
and O
the O
dawn O
be O
breaking O
above O
us. O
My O
limbs O
were O
weary O
and O
stiff, O
for O
I O
feared O
to O
change O
my O
position; O
yet O
my O
nerves O
were O
worked O
up O
to O
the O
highest O
pitch O
of O
tension, O
and O
my O
hearing O
was O
so O
acute O
that O
I O
could O
not O
only O
hear O
the O
gentle O
breathing O
of O
my O
companions, O
but O
I O
could O
distinguish O
the O
deeper, O
heavier O
in-breath O
of O
the O
bulky O
Jones O
from O
the O
thin, O
sighing O
note O
of O
the O
bank O
director. O
From O
my O
position O
I O
could O
look O
over O
the O
case O
in O
the O
direction O
of O
the O
floor. O
Suddenly O
my O
eyes O
caught O
the O
glint O
of O
a O
light. O
At O
first O
it O
was O
but O
a O
lurid O
spark O
upon O
the O
stone O
pavement. O
Then O
it O
lengthened O
out O
until O
it O
became O
a O
yellow O
line, O
and O
then, O
without O
any O
warning O
or O
sound, O
a O
gash O
seemed O
to O
open O
and O
a O
hand O
appeared, O
a O
white, O
almost O
womanly O
hand, O
which O
felt O
about O
in O
the O
centre O
of O
the O
little O
area O
of O
light. O
For O
a O
minute O
or O
more O
the O
hand, O
with O
its O
writhing O
fingers, O
protruded O
out O
of O
the O
floor. O
Then O
it O
was O
withdrawn O
as O
suddenly O
as O
it O
appeared, O
and O
all O
was O
dark O
again O
save O
the O
single O
lurid O
spark O
which O
marked O
a O
chink O
between O
the O
stones. O
Its O
disappearance, O
however, O
was O
but O
momentary. O
With O
a O
rending, O
tearing O
sound, O
one O
of O
the O
broad, O
white O
stones O
turned O
over O
upon O
its O
side O
and O
left O
a O
square, O
gaping O
hole, O
through O
which O
streamed O
the O
light O
of O
a O
lantern. O
Over O
the O
edge O
there O
peeped O
a O
clean-cut, O
boyish O
face, O
which O
looked O
keenly O
about O
it, O
and O
then, O
with O
a O
hand O
on O
either O
side O
of O
the O
aperture, O
drew O
itself O
shoulder-high O
and O
waist-high, O
until O
one O
knee O
rested O
upon O
the O
edge. O
In O
another O
instant O
he O
stood O
at O
the O
side O
of O
the O
hole O
and O
was O
hauling O
after O
him O
a O
companion, O
lithe O
and O
small O
like O
himself, O
with O
a O
pale O
face O
and O
a O
shock O
of O
very O
red O
hair. O
"It's O
all O
clear," O
he O
whispered. O
"Have O
you O
the O
chisel O
and O
the O
bags? O
Great O
Scott! O
Jump, O
Archie, O
jump, O
and O
I'll O
swing O
for O
it!" O
Sherlock O
Holmes O
had O
sprung O
out O
and O
seized O
the O
intruder O
by O
the O
collar. O
The O
other O
dived O
down O
the O
hole, O
and O
I O
heard O
the O
sound O
of O
rending O
cloth O
as O
Jones O
clutched O
at O
his O
skirts. O
The O
light O
flashed O
upon O
the O
barrel O
of O
a O
revolver, O
but O
Holmes' O
hunting O
crop O
came O
down O
on O
the O
man's O
wrist, O
and O
the O
pistol O
clinked O
upon O
the O
stone O
floor. O
"It's O
no O
use, O
John O
Clay," O
said O
Holmes O
blandly. O
"You O
have O
no O
chance O
at O
all." O
"So O
I O
see," O
the O
other O
answered O
with O
the O
utmost O
coolness. O
"I O
fancy O
that O
my O
pal O
is O
all O
right, O
though O
I O
see O
you O
have O
got O
his O
coat-tails." O
"There O
are O
three O
men O
waiting O
for O
him O
at O
the O
door," O
said O
Holmes. O
"Oh, O
indeed! O
You O
seem O
to O
have O
done O
the O
thing O
very O
completely. O
I O
must O
compliment O
you." O
"And O
I O
you," O
Holmes O
answered. O
"Your O
red-headed O
idea O
was O
very O
new O
and O
effective." O
"You'll O
see O
your O
pal O
again O
presently," O
said O
Jones. O
"He's O
quicker O
at O
climbing O
down O
holes O
than O
I O
am. O
Just O
hold O
out O
while O
I O
fix O
the O
derbies." O
"I O
beg O
that O
you O
will O
not O
touch O
me O
with O
your O
filthy O
hands," O
remarked O
our O
prisoner O
as O
the O
handcuffs O
clattered O
upon O
his O
wrists. O
"You O
may O
not O
be O
aware O
that O
I O
have O
royal O
blood O
in O
my O
veins. O
Have O
the O
goodness, O
also, O
when O
you O
address O
me O
always O
to O
say O
'sir' O
and O
'please.'" O
"All O
right," O
said O
Jones O
with O
a O
stare O
and O
a O
snigger. O
"Well, O
would O
you O
please, O
sir, O
march O
upstairs, O
where O
we O
can O
get O
a O
cab O
to O
carry O
your O
Highness O
to O
the O
police-station?" O
"That O
is O
better," O
said O
John O
Clay O
serenely. O
He O
made O
a O
sweeping O
bow O
to O
the O
three O
of O
us O
and O
walked O
quietly O
off O
in O
the O
custody O
of O
the O
detective. O
"Really, O
Mr. O
Holmes," O
said O
Mr. O
Merryweather O
as O
we O
followed O
them O
from O
the O
cellar, O
"I O
do O
not O
know O
how O
the O
bank O
can O
thank O
you O
or O
repay O
you. O
There O
is O
no O
doubt O
that O
you O
have O
detected O
and O
defeated O
in O
the O
most O
complete O
manner O
one O
of O
the O
most O
determined O
attempts O
at O
bank O
robbery O
that O
have O
ever O
come O
within O
my O
experience." O
"I O
have O
had O
one O
or O
two O
little O
scores O
of O
my O
own O
to O
settle O
with O
Mr. O
John O
Clay," O
said O
Holmes. O
"I O
have O
been O
at O
some O
small O
expense O
over O
this O
matter, O
which O
I O
shall O
expect O
the O
bank O
to O
refund, O
but O
beyond O
that O
I O
am O
amply O
repaid O
by O
having O
had O
an O
experience O
which O
is O
in O
many O
ways O
unique, O
and O
by O
hearing O
the O
very O
remarkable O
narrative O
of O
the O
Red-headed O
League." O
"You O
see, O
Watson," O
he O
explained O
in O
the O
early O
hours O
of O
the O
morning O
as O
we O
sat O
over O
a O
glass O
of O
whisky O
and O
soda O
in O
Baker O
Street, O
"it O
was O
perfectly O
obvious O
from O
the O
first O
that O
the O
only O
possible O
object O
of O
this O
rather O
fantastic O
business O
of O
the O
advertisement O
of O
the O
League, O
and O
the O
copying O
of O
the O
'Encyclopaedia,' O
must O
be O
to O
get O
this O
not O
over-bright O
pawnbroker O
out O
of O
the O
way O
for O
a O
number O
of O
hours O
every O
day. O
It O
was O
a O
curious O
way O
of O
managing O
it, O
but, O
really, O
it O
would O
be O
difficult O
to O
suggest O
a O
better. O
The O
method O
was O
no O
doubt O
suggested O
to O
Clay's O
ingenious O
mind O
by O
the O
colour O
of O
his O
accomplice's O
hair.DONEDET7414 O
pounds O
a O
week O
was O
a O
lure O
which O
must O
draw O
him, O
and O
what O
was O
it O
to O
them, O
who O
were O
playing O
for O
thousands? O
They O
put O
in O
the O
advertisement, O
one O
rogue O
has O
the O
temporary O
office, O
the O
other O
rogue O
incites O
the O
man O
to O
apply O
for O
it, O
and O
together O
they O
manage O
to O
secure O
his O
absence O
every O
morning O
in O
the O
week. O
From O
the O
time O
that O
I O
heard O
of O
the O
assistant O
having O
come O
for O
half O
wages, O
it O
was O
obvious O
to O
me O
that O
he O
had O
some O
strong O
motive O
for O
securing O
the O
situation." O
"But O
how O
could O
you O
guess O
what O
the O
motive O
was?" O
"Had O
there O
been O
women O
in O
the O
house, O
I O
should O
have O
suspected O
a O
mere O
vulgar O
intrigue. O
That, O
however, O
was O
out O
of O
the O
question. O
The O
man's O
business O
was O
a O
small O
one, O
and O
there O
was O
nothing O
in O
his O
house O
which O
could O
account O
for O
such O
elaborate O
preparations, O
and O
such O
an O
expenditure O
as O
they O
were O
at. O
It O
must, O
then, O
be O
something O
out O
of O
the O
house. O
What O
could O
it O
be? O
I O
thought O
of O
the O
assistant's O
fondness O
for O
photography, O
and O
his O
trick O
of O
vanishing O
into O
the O
cellar. O
The O
cellar! O
There O
was O
the O
end O
of O
this O
tangled O
clue. O
Then O
I O
made O
inquiries O
as O
to O
this O
mysterious O
assistant O
and O
found O
that O
I O
had O
to O
deal O
with O
one O
of O
the O
coolest O
and O
most O
daring O
criminals O
in O
London. O
He O
was O
doing O
something O
in O
the O
cellar-- O
something O
which O
took O
many O
hours O
a O
day O
for O
months O
on O
end. O
What O
could O
it O
be, O
once O
more? O
I O
could O
think O
of O
nothing O
save O
that O
he O
was O
running O
a O
tunnel O
to O
some O
other O
building. O
 O
So O
far O
I O
had O
got O
when O
we O
went O
to O
visit O
the O
scene O
of O
action. O
I O
surprised O
you O
by O
beating O
upon O
the O
pavement O
with O
my O
stick. O
I O
was O
ascertaining O
whether O
the O
cellar O
stretched O
out O
in O
front O
or O
behind. O
It O
was O
not O
in O
front. O
Then O
I O
rang O
the O
bell, O
and, O
as O
I O
hoped, O
the O
assistant O
answered O
it. O
We O
have O
had O
some O
skirmishes, O
but O
we O
had O
never O
set O
eyes O
upon O
each O
other O
before. O
I O
hardly O
looked O
at O
his O
face. O
His O
knees O
were O
what O
I O
wished O
to O
see. O
You O
must O
yourself O
have O
remarked O
how O
worn, O
wrinkled, O
and O
stained O
they O
were. O
They O
spoke O
of O
those O
hours O
of O
burrowing. O
The O
only O
remaining O
point O
was O
what O
they O
were O
burrowing O
for. O
I O
walked O
round O
the O
corner, O
saw O
the O
City O
and O
Suburban O
Bank O
abutted O
on O
our O
friend's O
premises, O
and O
felt O
that O
I O
had O
solved O
my O
problem. O
When O
you O
drove O
home O
after O
the O
concert O
I O
called O
upon O
Scotland O
Yard O
and O
upon O
the O
chairman O
of O
the O
bank O
directors, O
with O
the O
result O
that O
you O
have O
seen." O
"And O
how O
could O
you O
tell O
that O
they O
would O
make O
their O
attempt O
to-night?" O
I O
asked. O
"Well, O
when O
they O
closed O
their O
League O
offices O
that O
was O
a O
sign O
that O
they O
cared O
no O
longer O
about O
Mr. O
Jabez O
Wilson's O
presence-- O
in O
other O
words, O
that O
they O
had O
completed O
their O
tunnel. O
But O
it O
was O
essential O
that O
they O
should O
use O
it O
soon, O
as O
it O
might O
be O
discovered, O
or O
the O
bullion O
might O
be O
removed. O
Saturday O
would O
suit O
them O
better O
than O
any O
other O
day, O
as O
it O
would O
give O
them O
two O
days O
for O
their O
escape. O
For O
all O
these O
reasons O
I O
expected O
them O
to O
come O
to-night." O
"You O
reasoned O
it O
out O
beautifully," O
I O
exclaimed O
in O
unfeigned O
admiration. O
"It O
is O
so O
long O
a O
chain, O
and O
yet O
every O
link O
rings O
true." O
"It O
saved O
me O
from O
ennui," O
he O
answered, O
yawning. O
"Alas! O
I O
already O
feel O
it O
closing O
in O
upon O
me. O
My O
life O
is O
spent O
in O
one O
long O
effort O
to O
escape O
from O
the O
commonplaces O
of O
existence. O
These O
little O
problems O
help O
me O
to O
do O
so." O
"And O
you O
are O
a O
benefactor O
of O
the O
race," O
said O
I. O
He O
shrugged O
his O
shoulders. O
"Well, O
perhaps, O
after O
all, O
it O
is O
of O
some O
little O
use," O
he O
remarked. O
"'L'homme O
c'est O
rien-- O
l'oeuvre O
c'est O
tout,' O
as O
Gustave O
Flaubert O
wrote O
to O
George O
Sand." O
 O
 O

 O
I. O
To O
Sherlock O
Holmes O
she O
is O
always O
THE O
woman. O
I O
have O
seldom O
heard O
him O
mention O
her O
under O
any O
other O
name. O
In O
his O
eyes O
she O
eclipses O
and O
predominates O
the O
whole O
of O
her O
sex. O
It O
was O
not O
that O
he O
felt O
any O
emotion O
akin O
to O
love O
for O
Irene O
Adler. O
All O
emotions, O
and O
that O
one O
particularly, O
were O
abhorrent O
to O
his O
cold, O
precise O
but O
admirably O
balanced O
mind. O
He O
was, O
I O
take O
it, O
the O
most O
perfect O
reasoning O
and O
observing O
machine O
that O
the O
world O
has O
seen, O
but O
as O
a O
lover O
he O
would O
have O
placed O
himself O
in O
a O
false O
position. O
He O
never O
spoke O
of O
the O
softer O
passions, O
save O
with O
a O
gibe O
and O
a O
sneer. O
They O
were O
admirable O
things O
for O
the O
observer-- O
excellent O
for O
drawing O
the O
veil O
from O
men's O
motives O
and O
actions. O
But O
for O
the O
trained O
reasoner O
to O
admit O
such O
intrusions O
into O
his O
own O
delicate O
and O
finely O
adjusted O
temperament O
was O
to O
introduce O
a O
distracting O
factor O
which O
might O
throw O
a O
doubt O
upon O
all O
his O
mental O
results. O
Grit O
in O
a O
sensitive O
instrument, O
or O
a O
crack O
in O
one O
of O
his O
own O
high-power O
lenses, O
would O
not O
be O
more O
disturbing O
than O
a O
strong O
emotion O
in O
a O
nature O
such O
as O
his. O
And O
yet O
there O
was O
but O
one O
woman O
to O
him, O
and O
that O
woman O
was O
the O
late O
Irene O
Adler, O
of O
dubious O
and O
questionable O
memory. O
I O
had O
seen O
little O
of O
Holmes O
lately. O
My O
marriage O
had O
drifted O
us O
away O
from O
each O
other. O
My O
own O
complete O
happiness, O
and O
the O
home-centred O
interests O
which O
rise O
up O
around O
the O
man O
who O
first O
finds O
himself O
master O
of O
his O
own O
establishment, O
were O
sufficient O
to O
absorb O
all O
my O
attention, O
while O
Holmes, O
who O
loathed O
every O
form O
of O
society O
with O
his O
whole O
Bohemian O
soul, O
remained O
in O
our O
lodgings O
in O
Baker O
Street, O
buried O
among O
his O
old O
books, O
and O
alternating O
from O
week O
to O
week O
between O
cocaine O
and O
ambition, O
the O
drowsiness O
of O
the O
drug, O
and O
the O
fierce O
energy O
of O
his O
own O
keen O
nature. O
He O
was O
still, O
as O
ever, O
deeply O
attracted O
by O
the O
study O
of O
crime, O
and O
occupied O
his O
immense O
faculties O
and O
extraordinary O
powers O
of O
observation O
in O
following O
out O
those O
clues, O
and O
clearing O
up O
those O
mysteries O
which O
had O
been O
abandoned O
as O
hopeless O
by O
the O
official O
police. O
From O
time O
to O
time O
I O
heard O
some O
vague O
account O
of O
his O
doings: O
of O
his O
summons O
to O
Odessa O
in O
the O
case O
of O
the O
Trepoff O
murder, O
of O
his O
clearing O
up O
of O
the O
singular O
tragedy O
of O
the O
Atkinson O
brothers O
at O
Trincomalee, O
and O
finally O
of O
the O
mission O
which O
he O
had O
accomplished O
so O
delicately O
and O
successfully O
for O
the O
reigning O
family O
of O
Holland. O
Beyond O
these O
signs O
of O
his O
activity, O
however, O
which O
I O
merely O
shared O
with O
all O
the O
readers O
of O
the O
daily O
press, O
I O
knew O
little O
of O
my O
former O
friend O
and O
companion. O
One O
night-- O
it O
was O
on O
the O
twentieth O
of O
March, O
1888 O
-- O
I O
was O
returning O
from O
a O
journey O
to O
a O
patient O
(for O
I O
had O
now O
returned O
to O
civil O
practice), O
when O
my O
way O
led O
me O
through O
Baker O
Street. O
As O
I O
passed O
the O
well-remembered O
door, O
which O
must O
always O
be O
associated O
in O
my O
mind O
with O
my O
wooing, O
and O
with O
the O
dark O
incidents O
of O
the O
Study O
in O
Scarlet, O
I O
was O
seized O
with O
a O
keen O
desire O
to O
see O
Holmes O
again, O
and O
to O
know O
how O
he O
was O
employing O
his O
extraordinary O
powers. O
His O
rooms O
were O
brilliantly O
lit, O
and, O
even O
as O
I O
looked O
up, O
I O
saw O
his O
tall, O
spare O
figure O
pass O
twice O
in O
a O
dark O
silhouette O
against O
the O
blind. O
He O
was O
pacing O
the O
room O
swiftly, O
eagerly, O
with O
his O
head O
sunk O
upon O
his O
chest O
and O
his O
hands O
clasped O
behind O
him. O
To O
me, O
who O
knew O
his O
every O
mood O
and O
habit, O
his O
attitude O
and O
manner O
told O
their O
own O
story. O
He O
was O
at O
work O
again. O
He O
had O
risen O
out O
of O
his O
drug-created O
dreams O
and O
was O
hot O
upon O
the O
scent O
of O
some O
new O
problem. O
I O
rang O
the O
bell O
and O
was O
shown O
up O
to O
the O
chamber O
which O
had O
formerly O
been O
in O
part O
my O
own. O
His O
manner O
was O
not O
effusive. O
It O
seldom O
was; O
but O
he O
was O
glad, O
I O
think, O
to O
see O
me. O
With O
hardly O
a O
word O
spoken, O
but O
with O
a O
kindly O
eye, O
he O
waved O
me O
to O
an O
armchair, O
threw O
across O
his O
case O
of O
cigars, O
and O
indicated O
a O
spirit O
case O
and O
a O
gasogene O
in O
the O
corner. O
Then O
he O
stood O
before O
the O
fire O
and O
looked O
me Entity
over O
in O
his O
singular O
introspective O
fashion. O
"Wedlock Quotation
suits Quotation
you," Quotation
he Entity
remarked. Cue
"I Quotation
think, Quotation
Watson, Quotation
that Quotation
you Quotation
have Quotation
put Quotation
on Quotation
seven Quotation
and Quotation
a Quotation
half Quotation
pounds Quotation
since Quotation
I Quotation
saw Quotation
you." Quotation
"Seven!" Quotation
I Entity
answered. Cue
"Indeed, Quotation
I Quotation
should Quotation
have Quotation
thought Quotation
a Quotation
little Quotation
more. Quotation
Just Quotation
a Quotation
trifle Quotation
more, Quotation
I Quotation
fancy, Quotation
Watson. Quotation
And Quotation
in Quotation
practice Quotation
again, Quotation
I Quotation
observe. Quotation
You Quotation
did Quotation
not Quotation
tell Quotation
me Quotation
that Quotation
you Quotation
intended Quotation
to Quotation
go Quotation
into Quotation
harness." Quotation
"Then, Quotation
how Quotation
do Quotation
you Quotation
know?" Quotation
"I Quotation
see Quotation
it, Quotation
I Quotation
deduce Quotation
it. Quotation
How Quotation
do Quotation
I Quotation
know Quotation
that Quotation
you Quotation
have Quotation
been Quotation
getting Quotation
yourself Quotation
very Quotation
wet Quotation
lately, Quotation
and Quotation
that Quotation
you Quotation
have Quotation
a Quotation
most Quotation
clumsy Quotation
and Quotation
careless Quotation
servant Quotation
girl?" Quotation
"My Quotation
dear Quotation
Holmes," Quotation
said Cue
I, Entity
"this Quotation
is Quotation
too Quotation
much. Quotation
You Quotation
would Quotation
certainly Quotation
have Quotation
been Quotation
burned, Quotation
had Quotation
you Quotation
lived Quotation
a Quotation
few Quotation
centuries Quotation
ago. Quotation
It Quotation
is Quotation
true Quotation
that Quotation
I Quotation
had Quotation
a Quotation
country Quotation
walk Quotation
on Quotation
Thursday Quotation
and Quotation
came Quotation
home Quotation
in Quotation
a Quotation
dreadful Quotation
mess, Quotation
but Quotation
as Quotation
I Quotation
have Quotation
changed Quotation
my Quotation
clothes Quotation
I Quotation
can't Quotation
imagine Quotation
how Quotation
you Quotation
deduce Quotation
it. Quotation
As Quotation
to Quotation
Mary Quotation
Jane, Quotation
she Quotation
is Quotation
incorrigible, Quotation
and Quotation
my Quotation
wife Quotation
has Quotation
given Quotation
her Quotation
notice, Quotation
but Quotation
there, Quotation
again, Quotation
I Quotation
fail Quotation
to Quotation
see Quotation
how Quotation
you Quotation
work Quotation
it Quotation
out." Quotation
He O
chuckled O
to O
himself O
and O
rubbed O
his O
long, O
nervous O
hands O
together. O
"It Quotation
is Quotation
simplicity Quotation
itself," Quotation
said Cue
he; Entity
"my Quotation
eyes Quotation
tell Quotation
me Quotation
that Quotation
on Quotation
the Quotation
inside Quotation
of Quotation
your Quotation
left Quotation
shoe, Quotation
just Quotation
where Quotation
the Quotation
firelight Quotation
strikes Quotation
it, Quotation
the Quotation
leather Quotation
is Quotation
scored Quotation
by Quotation
six Quotation
almost Quotation
parallel Quotation
cuts. Quotation
Obviously Quotation
they Quotation
have Quotation
been Quotation
caused Quotation
by Quotation
someone Quotation
who Quotation
has Quotation
very Quotation
carelessly Quotation
scraped Quotation
round Quotation
the Quotation
edges Quotation
of Quotation
the Quotation
sole Quotation
in Quotation
order Quotation
to Quotation
remove Quotation
crusted Quotation
mud Quotation
from Quotation
it. Quotation
Hence, Quotation
you Quotation
see, Quotation
my Quotation
double Quotation
deduction Quotation
that Quotation
you Quotation
had Quotation
been Quotation
out Quotation
in Quotation
vile Quotation
weather, Quotation
and Quotation
that Quotation
you Quotation
had Quotation
a Quotation
particularly Quotation
malignant Quotation
boot-slitting Quotation
specimen Quotation
of Quotation
the Quotation
London Quotation
slavey. Quotation
As Quotation
to Quotation
your Quotation
practice, Quotation
if Quotation
a Quotation

walks Quotation
into Quotation
my Quotation
rooms Quotation

iodoform, Quotation
with Quotation
a Quotation
black Quotation
mark Quotation

nitrate Quotation

silver Quotation
upon Quotation
his Quotation

forefinger, Quotation

side Quotation
of Quotation
his Quotation
top-hat Quotation

show Quotation
where Quotation

I Quotation

dull, Quotation
indeed, Quotation
if Quotation
I Quotation
do Quotation
not Quotation
pronounce Quotation
him Quotation

an Quotation
active Quotation
member Quotation
of Quotation
the Quotation
medical Quotation
profession." Quotation
I O
could O
not O
help O
laughing O
at O
the O
ease O
with O
which O
he O
explained O
his O
process O
of O
deduction. O
"When Quotation
I Quotation
hear Quotation
you Quotation
give Quotation
your Quotation
reasons," Quotation
I Entity
remarked, Cue
"the Quotation
thing Quotation
always Quotation
appears Quotation
to Quotation
me Quotation
to Quotation
be Quotation
so Quotation
ridiculously Quotation
simple Quotation
that Quotation
I Quotation
could Quotation
easily Quotation
do Quotation
it Quotation
myself, Quotation
though Quotation
at Quotation
each Quotation
successive Quotation
instance Quotation
of Quotation
your Quotation
reasoning Quotation
I Quotation
am Quotation
baffled Quotation
until Quotation
you Quotation
explain Quotation
your Quotation
process. Quotation
And Quotation
yet Quotation
I Quotation
believe Quotation
that Quotation
my Quotation
eyes Quotation
are Quotation
as Quotation
good Quotation
as Quotation
yours." Quotation
"Quite Quotation
so," Quotation
he Entity
answered, Cue
lighting O
a O
cigarette, O
and O
throwing O
himself O
down O
into O
an O
armchair. O
"You Quotation
see, Quotation
but Quotation
you Quotation
do Quotation
not Quotation
observe. Quotation
The Quotation
distinction Quotation
is Quotation
clear. Quotation
For Quotation
example, Quotation
you Quotation
have Quotation
frequently Quotation
seen Quotation
the Quotation
steps Quotation
which Quotation
lead Quotation
up Quotation
from Quotation
the Quotation
hall Quotation
to Quotation
this Quotation
room." Quotation
"Frequently." Quotation
"How Quotation
often?" Quotation
"Well, Quotation
some Quotation
hundreds Quotation
of Quotation
times." Quotation
"Then Quotation
how Quotation
many Quotation
are Quotation
there?" Quotation
"How Quotation
many? Quotation
I Quotation
don't Quotation
know." Quotation
"Quite Quotation
so! Quotation
You Quotation
have Quotation
not Quotation
observed. Quotation
And Quotation
yet Quotation
you Quotation
have Quotation
seen. Quotation
That Quotation
is Quotation
just Quotation
my Quotation
point. Quotation
Now, Quotation
I Quotation
know Quotation
that Quotation
there Quotation
are Quotation
seventeen Quotation
steps, Quotation
because Quotation
I Quotation
have Quotation
both Quotation
seen Quotation
and Quotation
observed. Quotation
By-the-way, Quotation
since Quotation
you Quotation
are Quotation
interested Quotation
in Quotation
these Quotation
little Quotation
problems, Quotation
and Quotation
since Quotation
you Quotation
are Quotation
good Quotation
enough Quotation
to Quotation
chronicle Quotation
one Quotation
or Quotation
two Quotation
of Quotation
my Quotation
trifling Quotation
experiences, Quotation
you Quotation
may Quotation
be Quotation
interested Quotation
in Quotation
this." Quotation
He O
threw O
over O
a O
sheet O
of O
thick, O
pink-tinted O
note-paper O
which O
had O
been O
lying O
open O
upon O
the O
table. O
"It Quotation
came Quotation
by Quotation
the Quotation
last Quotation
post," Quotation
said Cue
he. Entity
"Read Quotation
it Quotation
aloud." Quotation
The O
note O
was O
undated, O

without O
either O
signature O
or O
address. O
"There Quotation
will Quotation
call Quotation
upon Quotation
you Quotation
to-night, Quotation
at Quotation
a Quotation
quarter Quotation

eight Quotation
o'clock," Quotation
it O
said, O
"a Quotation
gentleman Quotation
who Quotation
desires Quotation
to Quotation
consult Quotation
you Quotation
upon Quotation
a Quotation
matter Quotation
of Quotation
the Quotation
very Quotation
deepest Quotation
moment. Quotation
Your Quotation
recent Quotation

one Quotation

the Quotation
royal Quotation

shown Quotation

safely Quotation

trusted Quotation
with Quotation
matters Quotation
which Quotation

of Quotation
an Quotation
importance Quotation

hardly Quotation
be Quotation
exaggerated. Quotation
This Quotation
account Quotation
of Quotation

Be Quotation

your Quotation

it Quotation
amiss Quotation
if Quotation

"This Quotation
is Quotation
indeed Quotation
a Quotation
mystery," Quotation
I Entity

"What Quotation
do Quotation
you Quotation
imagine Quotation
that Quotation
it Quotation
means?" Quotation
"I Quotation
have Quotation
no Quotation
data Quotation
yet. Quotation
It Quotation
is Quotation
a Quotation
capital Quotation
mistake Quotation
to Quotation
theorize Quotation
before Quotation
one Quotation

Insensibly Quotation
one Quotation

But Quotation
the Quotation

What Quotation

it?" Quotation
I O
carefully O
examined O
the O

the O
paper O
upon O
which O
it O
was O
written. O
"The Quotation

I Entity

endeavouring O
to O
imitate O
my Entity

processes. O
"Such Quotation
paper Quotation
could Quotation
not Quotation
be Quotation
bought Quotation
under Quotation
half Quotation
a Quotation
crown Quotation
a Quotation

It Quotation

peculiarly Quotation
strong Quotation

"Peculiar-- Quotation
that Quotation

the Quotation
very Quotation
word," Quotation
said Cue
Holmes. Entity
"It Quotation

not Quotation
an Quotation
English Quotation

all. Quotation
Hold Quotation
it Quotation
up Quotation

I Entity
did O
so, O

saw O
a O
large O

with O
a O
small O
"g," O
a O
"P," O

a O
large O

"What Quotation

asked Cue
Holmes. Entity
"The Quotation

of Quotation
the Quotation

no Quotation

his Quotation
monogram, Quotation
rather." Quotation
"Not Quotation
at Quotation
all. Quotation
The Quotation
'G' Quotation
with Quotation
the Quotation
small Quotation
't' Quotation
stands Quotation
for Quotation
'Gesellschaft,' Quotation
which Quotation

the Quotation
German Quotation
for Quotation

It Quotation
is Quotation
a Quotation
customary Quotation

He Entity
took O
down O
a O
heavy O
brown O

"Eglow, Quotation
Eglonitz-- Quotation

Ha, Quotation

His O

"The Quotation

out O

"A Quotation

A O
slow O
and O
heavy O
step, O
which O
had O
been O
heard O
upon O
the O
stairs O
and O
in O
the O
passage, O
paused O
immediately O
outside O
the O
door. O
Then O
there O
was O
a O
loud O
and O
authoritative O
tap. O
"Come Quotation
in!" Quotation
said Cue
Holmes. Entity
A Entity
man Entity
entered O
who O
could O
hardly O
have O
been O
less O
than O
six O
feet O
six O
inches O
in O
height, O
with O
the O
chest O
and O
limbs O
of O
a O
Hercules. O
His O
dress O
was O
rich O
with O
a O
richness O
which O
would, O
in O
England, O
be O
looked O
upon O
as O
akin O
to O
bad O
taste. O
Heavy O
bands O
of O
astrakhan O
were O
slashed O
across O
the O
sleeves O
and O
fronts O
of O
his O
double-breasted O
coat, O
while O
the O
deep O
blue O
cloak O
which O
was O
thrown O
over O
his O
shoulders O
was O
lined O
with O
flame-coloured O
silk O
and O
secured O
at O
the O
neck O
with O
a O
brooch O
which O
consisted O
of O
a O
single O
flaming O
beryl. O
Boots O
which O
extended O
halfway O
up O
his O
calves, O
and O
which O
were O
trimmed O
at O
the O
tops O
with O
rich O
brown O
fur, O
completed O
the O
impression O
of O
barbaric O
opulence O
which O
was O
suggested O
by O
his O
whole O
appearance. O
He O
carried O
a O
broad-brimmed O
hat O
in O
his O
hand, O
while O
he O
wore O
across O
the O
upper O
part O
of O
his O
face, O
extending O
down O
past O
the O
cheekbones, O
a O
black O
vizard O
mask, O
which O
he O
had O
apparently O
adjusted O
that O
very O
moment, O
for O
his O
hand O
was O
still O
raised O
to O
it O
as O
he O
entered. O
From O
the O
lower O
part O
of O
the O
face O
he O
appeared O
to O
be O
a O
man O
of O
strong O
character, O
with O
a O
thick, O
hanging O
lip, O
and O
a O
long, O
straight O
chin O
suggestive O
of O
resolution O
pushed O
to O
the O
length O
of O
obstinacy. O
"You Quotation
had Quotation
my Quotation
note?" Quotation
he Entity
asked Cue
with O
a O
deep O
harsh O
voice O
and O
a O
strongly O
marked O
German O
accent. O
"I Quotation
told Quotation
you Quotation
that Quotation
I Quotation
would Quotation
call." Quotation
He Entity
looked O
from O
one O

the O
other O
of O
us, Entity
as O
if O
uncertain O
which O
to O
address. O
"Pray Quotation
take Quotation
a Quotation
seat," Quotation
said Cue
Holmes. Entity
"This Quotation

I O
rose O

Holmes O
caught O
me O
by O
the O

pushed O
me Entity
back O
into O

"It Quotation

anything Quotation

The O

his O

he, Entity
"by Quotation

Holmes. Entity
"And Quotation
I." Quotation
"You Quotation

dryly. O
"The Quotation

"I Quotation

Holmes, Entity
settling O
himself O
down O
in O
his O
armchair O

closing O
his O

Our O
visitor O
glanced O
with O
some O
apparent O
surprise O
at O
the O
languid, O
lounging O
figure O
of O
the O
man O
who O

been O
no O

depicted O

the O
most O
incisive O

Holmes O
slowly O
reopened O
his O
eyes O

looked O
impatiently O
at O
his Entity
gigantic Entity
client. Entity
"If Quotation
your Quotation

condescend Quotation

state Quotation
your Quotation

he Entity
remarked, Cue
"I Quotation
should Quotation
be Quotation
better Quotation
able Quotation
to Quotation
advise Quotation
you." Quotation
The O
man O
sprang O
from O
his O
chair O
and O
paced O
up O
and O
down O
the O
room O
in O
uncontrollable O
agitation. O
Then, O
with O
a O
gesture O
of O
desperation, O
he O
tore O
the O
mask O
from O
his O
face O
and O
hurled O
it O
upon O
the O
ground. O
"You Quotation
are Quotation
right," Quotation
he Entity
cried; Cue
"I Quotation
am Quotation
the Quotation
King. Quotation
Why Quotation
should Quotation
I Quotation
attempt Quotation
to Quotation
conceal Quotation
it?" Quotation
"Why, Quotation
indeed?" Quotation
murmured Cue
Holmes. Entity
"Your Quotation

"But Quotation
you Quotation

our Entity
strange Entity
visitor, Entity
sitting O
down O
once O
more O

passing O
his O
hand O
over O
his O
high O
white O
forehead, O
"you Quotation

not Quotation
accustomed Quotation

such Quotation

Yet Quotation
the Quotation

so Quotation
delicate Quotation

I Quotation
could Quotation
not Quotation
confide Quotation
it Quotation

shutting O
his O

once O

"The Quotation
facts Quotation

briefly Quotation
these: Quotation
Some Quotation
five Quotation

during Quotation
a Quotation
lengthy Quotation

Warsaw, Quotation
I Quotation
made Quotation

"Kindly Quotation
look Quotation
her Quotation
up Quotation
in Quotation
my Quotation
index, Quotation
Doctor," Quotation
murmured Cue
Holmes Entity
without O
opening O
his O
eyes. O
For O
many O
years O
he O
had O
adopted O
a O
system O
of O
docketing O
all O
paragraphs O
concerning O
men O
and O
things, O
so O
that O
it O
was O
difficult O
to O
name O
a O

a O
person O
on O
which O
he O
could O
not O
at O

furnish O

In O
this O

I Entity

sandwiched O
in O

that O

written O

At O

it O
was O
surrounded O
by O
none O
of O
the O
grim O
and O
strange O
features O
which O
were O
associated O
with O
the O
two O
crimes O
which O
I O
have O
already O
recorded, O
still, O
the O
nature O
of O
the O
case O
and O
the O
exalted O
station O
of O
his O
client O
gave O
it O
a O
character O
of O
its O
own. O
Indeed, O
apart O
from O
the O
nature O
of O
the O
investigation O
which O
my O
friend O
had O
on O
hand, O
there O
was O
something O
in O
his O
masterly O
grasp O
of O
a O
situation, O
and O
his O
keen, O
incisive O
reasoning, O
which O
made O
it O
a O
pleasure O
to O
me O
to O
study O
his O
system O
of O
work, O
and O
to O
follow O
the O
quick, O
subtle O
methods O
by O
which O
he O
disentangled O
the O
most O
inextricable O
mysteries. O
So O
accustomed O
was O
I O
to O
his O
invariable O
success O
that O
the O
very O
possibility O
of O
his O
failing O
had O
ceased O
to O
enter O
into O
my O
head. O
It O
was O
close O
upon O
four O
before O
the O
door O
opened, O
and O
a O
drunken-looking O
groom, O
ill-kempt O
and O
side-whiskered, O
with O
an O
inflamed O
face O
and O
disreputable O
clothes, O
walked O
into O
the O
room. O
Accustomed O
as O
I O
was O
to O
my O
friend's O
amazing O
powers O
in O
the O
use O
of O
disguises, O
I O
had O
to O
look O
three O
times O
before O
I Entity
was O
certain O
that O
it O
was O
indeed O
he. O
With O
a O
nod O
he O
vanished O
into O
the O
bedroom, O
whence O
he O
emerged O
in O
five O
minutes O
tweed-suited O
and O
respectable, O
as O
of O
old. O
Putting O
his O
hands O
into O
his O
pockets, O
he O
stretched O
out O
his O
legs O
in O
front O
of O
the O
fire O
and O
laughed O
heartily O
for O
some O
minutes. O
"Well, Quotation
really!" Quotation
he Entity
cried, Cue
and O
then O
he O
choked O
and O
laughed O
again O
until O
he O
was O
obliged O
to O
lie O
back, O
limp O
and O
helpless, O
in O
the O
chair. O
"What Quotation
is Quotation
it?" Quotation
"It's Quotation
quite Quotation
too Quotation
funny. Quotation
I Quotation
am Quotation
sure Quotation
you Quotation
could Quotation
never Quotation
guess Quotation
how Quotation
I Quotation
employed Quotation
my Quotation
morning, Quotation
or Quotation
what Quotation
I Quotation
ended Quotation
by Quotation
doing." Quotation
"I Quotation
can't Quotation
imagine. Quotation
I Quotation
suppose Quotation
that Quotation
you Quotation
have Quotation
been Quotation
watching Quotation
the Quotation
habits, Quotation
and Quotation
perhaps Quotation
the Quotation
house, Quotation
of Quotation
Miss Quotation
Irene Quotation
Adler." Quotation
"Quite Quotation
so; Quotation
but Quotation
the Quotation
sequel Quotation
was Quotation
rather Quotation
unusual. Quotation
I Quotation
will Quotation
tell Quotation
you, Quotation
however. Quotation
I Quotation
left Quotation
the Quotation
house Quotation
a Quotation
little Quotation
after Quotation
eight Quotation
o'clock Quotation
this Quotation
morning Quotation
in Quotation
the Quotation
character Quotation
of Quotation
a Quotation
groom Quotation
out Quotation
of Quotation
work. Quotation
There Quotation
is Quotation
a Quotation
wonderful Quotation
sympathy Quotation
and Quotation
freemasonry Quotation
among Quotation
horsey Quotation
men. Quotation
Be Quotation
one Quotation
of Quotation
them, Quotation
and Quotation
you Quotation
will Quotation
know Quotation
all Quotation
that Quotation
there Quotation
is Quotation
to Quotation
know. Quotation
I Quotation
soon Quotation
found Quotation
Briony Quotation
Lodge. Quotation
It Quotation
is Quotation
a Quotation
bijou Quotation
villa, Quotation
with Quotation
a Quotation
garden Quotation
at Quotation
the Quotation
back, Quotation
but Quotation
built Quotation
out Quotation
in Quotation
front Quotation
right Quotation
up Quotation
to Quotation
the Quotation
road, Quotation
two Quotation
stories. Quotation
Chubb Quotation
lock Quotation
to Quotation
the Quotation
door. Quotation
Large Quotation
sitting-room Quotation
on Quotation
the Quotation
right Quotation
side, Quotation
well Quotation
furnished, Quotation
with Quotation
long Quotation
windows Quotation
almost Quotation
to Quotation
the Quotation
floor, Quotation
and Quotation
those Quotation
preposterous Quotation
English Quotation
window Quotation
fasteners Quotation
which Quotation
a Quotation
child Quotation
could Quotation
open. Quotation
Behind Quotation
there Quotation
was Quotation
nothing Quotation
remarkable, Quotation
save Quotation
that Quotation
the Quotation
passage Quotation
window Quotation
could Quotation
be Quotation
reached Quotation
from Quotation
the Quotation
top Quotation
of Quotation
the Quotation
coach-house. Quotation
I Quotation
walked Quotation
round Quotation
it Quotation
and Quotation
examined Quotation
it Quotation
closely Quotation
from Quotation
every Quotation
point Quotation
of Quotation
view, Quotation
but Quotation
without Quotation
noting Quotation
anything Quotation
else Quotation
of Quotation
interest. Quotation
 Quotation
I Quotation
then Quotation
lounged Quotation
down Quotation
the Quotation
street Quotation
and Quotation
found, Quotation
as Quotation
I Quotation
expected, Quotation
that Quotation
there Quotation
was Quotation
a Quotation
mews Quotation
in Quotation
a Quotation
lane Quotation
which Quotation
runs Quotation
down Quotation
by Quotation
one Quotation
wall Quotation
of Quotation
the Quotation
garden. Quotation
I Quotation
lent Quotation
the Quotation
ostlers Quotation
a Quotation
hand Quotation
in Quotation
rubbing Quotation
down Quotation
their Quotation
horses, Quotation
and Quotation
received Quotation
in Quotation
exchange Quotation
twopence, Quotation
a Quotation
glass Quotation
of Quotation
half Quotation
and Quotation
half, Quotation
two Quotation
fills Quotation
of Quotation
shag Quotation
tobacco, Quotation
and Quotation
as Quotation
much Quotation
information Quotation
as Quotation
I Quotation
could Quotation
desire Quotation
about Quotation
Miss Quotation
Adler, Quotation
to Quotation
say Quotation
nothing Quotation
of Quotation
half Quotation
a Quotation
dozen Quotation
other Quotation
people Quotation
in Quotation
the Quotation
neighbourhood Quotation
in Quotation
whom Quotation
I Quotation
was Quotation
not Quotation
in Quotation
the Quotation
least Quotation
interested, Quotation
but Quotation
whose Quotation
biographies Quotation
I Quotation
was Quotation
compelled Quotation
to Quotation
listen Quotation
to." Quotation
"And Quotation
what Quotation
of Quotation
Irene Quotation
Adler?" Quotation
I Entity
asked. Cue
"Oh, Quotation
she Quotation
has Quotation
turned Quotation
all Quotation
the Quotation
men's Quotation
heads Quotation
down Quotation
in Quotation
that Quotation
part. Quotation
She Quotation
is Quotation
the Quotation
daintiest Quotation
thing Quotation
under Quotation
a Quotation
bonnet Quotation
on Quotation
this Quotation
planet. Quotation
So Quotation
say Quotation
the Quotation
Serpentine-mews, Quotation
to Quotation
a Quotation
man. Quotation
She Quotation
lives Quotation
quietly, Quotation
sings Quotation
at Quotation
concerts, Quotation
drives Quotation
out Quotation
at Quotation
five Quotation
every Quotation
day, Quotation
and Quotation
returns Quotation
at Quotation
seven Quotation
sharp Quotation
for Quotation
dinner. Quotation
Seldom Quotation
goes Quotation
out Quotation
at Quotation
other Quotation
times, Quotation
except Quotation
when Quotation
she Quotation
sings. Quotation
Has Quotation
only Quotation
one Quotation
male Quotation
visitor, Quotation
but Quotation
a Quotation
good Quotation
deal Quotation
of Quotation
him. Quotation
He Quotation
is Quotation
dark, Quotation
handsome, Quotation
and Quotation
dashing, Quotation
never Quotation
calls Quotation
less Quotation
than Quotation
once Quotation
a Quotation
day, Quotation
and Quotation
often Quotation
twice. Quotation
He Quotation
is Quotation
a Quotation
Mr. Quotation
Godfrey Quotation
Norton, Quotation
of Quotation
the Quotation
Inner Quotation
Temple. Quotation
See Quotation
the Quotation
advantages Quotation
of Quotation
a Quotation
cabman Quotation
as Quotation
a Quotation
confidant. Quotation
They Quotation
had Quotation
driven Quotation
him Quotation
home Quotation
a Quotation
dozen Quotation
times Quotation
from Quotation
Serpentine-mews, Quotation
and Quotation
knew Quotation
all Quotation
about Quotation
him. Quotation
When Quotation
I Quotation
had Quotation
listened Quotation
to Quotation
all Quotation
they Quotation
had Quotation
to Quotation
tell, Quotation
I Quotation
began Quotation
to Quotation
walk Quotation
up Quotation
and Quotation
down Quotation
near Quotation
Briony Quotation
Lodge Quotation
once Quotation
more, Quotation
and Quotation
to Quotation
think Quotation
over Quotation
my Quotation
plan Quotation
of Quotation
campaign. Quotation
 Quotation
This Quotation
Godfrey Quotation
Norton Quotation
was Quotation
evidently Quotation
an Quotation
important Quotation
factor Quotation
in Quotation
the Quotation
matter. Quotation
He Quotation
was Quotation
a Quotation
lawyer. Quotation
That Quotation
sounded Quotation
ominous. Quotation
What Quotation
was Quotation
the Quotation
relation Quotation
between Quotation
them, Quotation
and Quotation
what Quotation
the Quotation
object Quotation
of Quotation
his Quotation
repeated Quotation
visits? Quotation
Was Quotation
she Quotation
his Quotation
client, Quotation
his Quotation
friend, Quotation
or Quotation
his Quotation
mistress? Quotation
If Quotation
the Quotation
former, Quotation
she Quotation
had Quotation
probably Quotation
transferred Quotation
the Quotation
photograph Quotation
to Quotation
his Quotation
keeping. Quotation
If Quotation
the Quotation
latter, Quotation
it Quotation
was Quotation
less Quotation
likely. Quotation
On Quotation
the Quotation
issue Quotation
of Quotation
this Quotation
question Quotation
depended Quotation
whether Quotation
I Quotation
should Quotation
continue Quotation
my Quotation
work Quotation
at Quotation
Briony Quotation
Lodge, Quotation
or Quotation
turn Quotation
my Quotation
attention Quotation
to Quotation
the Quotation
gentleman's Quotation
chambers Quotation
in Quotation
the Quotation
Temple. Quotation
It Quotation
was Quotation
a Quotation
delicate Quotation
point, Quotation
and Quotation
it Quotation
widened Quotation
the Quotation
field Quotation
of Quotation
my Quotation
inquiry. Quotation
I Quotation
fear Quotation
that Quotation
I Quotation
bore Quotation
you Quotation
with Quotation
these Quotation
details, Quotation
but Quotation
I Quotation
have Quotation
to Quotation
let Quotation
you Quotation
see Quotation
my Quotation
little Quotation
difficulties, Quotation
if Quotation
you Quotation
are Quotation
to Quotation
understand Quotation
the Quotation
situation." Quotation
"I Quotation
am Quotation
following Quotation
you Quotation
closely," Quotation
I Entity
answered. Cue
"I Quotation
was Quotation
still Quotation
balancing Quotation
the Quotation
matter Quotation
in Quotation
my Quotation
mind Quotation
when Quotation
a Quotation
hansom Quotation
cab Quotation
drove Quotation
up Quotation
to Quotation
Briony Quotation
Lodge, Quotation
and Quotation
a Quotation
gentleman Quotation
sprang Quotation
out. Quotation
He Quotation
was Quotation
a Quotation
remarkably Quotation
handsome Quotation
man, Quotation
dark, Quotation
aquiline, Quotation
and Quotation
moustached-- Quotation
evidently Quotation
the Quotation
man Quotation
of Quotation
whom Quotation
I Quotation
had Quotation
heard. Quotation
He Quotation
appeared Quotation
to Quotation
be Quotation
in Quotation
a Quotation
great Quotation
hurry, Quotation
shouted Quotation
to Quotation
the Quotation
cabman Quotation
to Quotation
wait, Quotation
and Quotation
brushed Quotation
past Quotation
the Quotation
maid Quotation
who Quotation
opened Quotation
the Quotation
door Quotation
with Quotation
the Quotation
air Quotation
of Quotation
a Quotation
man Quotation
who Quotation
was Quotation
thoroughly Quotation
at Quotation
home. Quotation
 Quotation
He Quotation
was Quotation
in Quotation
the Quotation
house Quotation
about Quotation
half Quotation
an Quotation
hour, Quotation
and Quotation
I Quotation
could Quotation
catch Quotation
glimpses Quotation
of Quotation
him Quotation
in Quotation
the Quotation
windows Quotation
of Quotation
the Quotation
sitting-room, Quotation
pacing Quotation
up Quotation
and Quotation
down, Quotation
talking Quotation
excitedly, Quotation
and Quotation
waving Quotation
his Quotation
arms. Quotation
Of Quotation
her Quotation
I Quotation
could Quotation
see Quotation
nothing. Quotation
Presently Quotation
he Quotation
emerged, Quotation
looking Quotation
even Quotation
more Quotation
flurried Quotation
than Quotation
before. Quotation
As Quotation
he Quotation
stepped Quotation
up Quotation
to Quotation
the Quotation
cab, Quotation
he Quotation
pulled Quotation
a Quotation
gold Quotation
watch Quotation
from Quotation
his Quotation
pocket Quotation
and Quotation
looked Quotation
at Quotation
it Quotation
earnestly, Quotation
'Drive Quotation
like Quotation
the Quotation
devil,' Quotation
he Quotation
shouted, Quotation
'first Quotation
to Quotation
Gross Quotation
& Quotation
Hankey's Quotation
in Quotation
Regent Quotation
Street, Quotation
and Quotation
then Quotation
to Quotation
the Quotation
Church Quotation
of Quotation
St. Quotation
Monica Quotation
in Quotation
the Quotation
Edgeware Quotation
Road. Quotation
Half Quotation
a Quotation
guinea Quotation
if Quotation
you Quotation
do Quotation
it Quotation
in Quotation
twenty Quotation
minutes!' Quotation
 Quotation
Away Quotation
they Quotation
went, Quotation
and Quotation
I Quotation
was Quotation
just Quotation
wondering Quotation
whether Quotation
I Quotation
should Quotation
not Quotation
do Quotation
well Quotation
to Quotation
follow Quotation
them Quotation
when Quotation
up Quotation
the Quotation
lane Quotation
came Quotation
a Quotation
neat Quotation
little Quotation
landau, Quotation
the Quotation
coachman Quotation
with Quotation
his Quotation
coat Quotation
only Quotation
half-buttoned, Quotation
and Quotation
his Quotation
tie Quotation
under Quotation
his Quotation
ear, Quotation
while Quotation
all Quotation
the Quotation
tags Quotation
of Quotation
his Quotation
harness Quotation
were Quotation
sticking Quotation
out Quotation
of Quotation
the Quotation
buckles. Quotation
It Quotation
hadn't Quotation
pulled Quotation
up Quotation
before Quotation
she Quotation
shot Quotation
out Quotation
of Quotation
the Quotation
hall Quotation
door Quotation
and Quotation
into Quotation
it. Quotation
I Quotation
only Quotation
caught Quotation
a Quotation
glimpse Quotation
of Quotation
her Quotation
at Quotation
the Quotation
moment, Quotation
but Quotation
she Quotation
was Quotation
a Quotation
lovely Quotation
woman, Quotation
with Quotation
a Quotation
face Quotation
that Quotation
a Quotation
man Quotation
might Quotation
die Quotation
for. Quotation
 Quotation
'The Quotation
Church Quotation
of Quotation
St. Quotation
Monica, Quotation
John,' Quotation
she Quotation
cried, Quotation
'and Quotation
half Quotation
a Quotation
sovereign Quotation
if Quotation
you Quotation
reach Quotation
it Quotation
in Quotation
twenty Quotation
minutes.' Quotation
 Quotation
This Quotation
was Quotation
quite Quotation
too Quotation
good Quotation
to Quotation
lose, Quotation
Watson. Quotation
I Quotation
was Quotation
just Quotation
balancing Quotation
whether Quotation
I Quotation
should Quotation
run Quotation
for Quotation
it, Quotation
or Quotation
whether Quotation
I Quotation
should Quotation
perch Quotation
behind Quotation
her Quotation
landau Quotation
when Quotation
a Quotation
cab Quotation
came Quotation
through Quotation
the Quotation
street. Quotation
The Quotation
driver Quotation
looked Quotation
twice Quotation
at Quotation
such Quotation
a Quotation
shabby Quotation
fare, Quotation
but Quotation
I Quotation
jumped Quotation
in Quotation
before Quotation
he Quotation
could Quotation
object. Quotation
'The Quotation
Church Quotation
of Quotation
St. Quotation
Monica,' Quotation
said Quotation
I, Quotation
'and Quotation
half Quotation
a Quotation
sovereign Quotation
if Quotation
you Quotation
reach Quotation
it Quotation
in Quotation
twenty Quotation
minutes.' Quotation
It Quotation
was Quotation
twenty-five Quotation
minutes Quotation
to Quotation
twelve, Quotation
and Quotation
of Quotation
course Quotation
it Quotation
was Quotation
clear Quotation
enough Quotation
what Quotation
was Quotation
in Quotation
the Quotation
wind. Quotation
 Quotation
My Quotation
cabby Quotation
drove Quotation
fast. Quotation
I Quotation
don't Quotation
think Quotation
I Quotation
ever Quotation
drove Quotation
faster, Quotation
but Quotation
the Quotation
others Quotation
were Quotation
there Quotation
before Quotation
us. Quotation
The Quotation
cab Quotation
and Quotation
the Quotation
landau Quotation
with Quotation
their Quotation
steaming Quotation
horses Quotation
were Quotation
in Quotation
front Quotation
of Quotation
the Quotation
door Quotation
when Quotation
I Quotation
arrived. Quotation
I Quotation
paid Quotation
the Quotation
man Quotation
and Quotation
hurried Quotation
into Quotation
the Quotation
church. Quotation
There Quotation
was Quotation
not Quotation
a Quotation
soul Quotation
there Quotation
save Quotation
the Quotation
two Quotation
whom Quotation
I Quotation
had Quotation
followed Quotation
and Quotation
a Quotation
surpliced Quotation
clergyman, Quotation
who Quotation
seemed Quotation
to Quotation
be Quotation
expostulating Quotation
with Quotation
them. Quotation
They Quotation
were Quotation
all Quotation
three Quotation
standing Quotation
in Quotation
a Quotation
knot Quotation
in Quotation
front Quotation
of Quotation
the Quotation
altar. Quotation
I Quotation
lounged Quotation
up Quotation
the Quotation
side Quotation
aisle Quotation
like Quotation
any Quotation
other Quotation
idler Quotation
who Quotation
has Quotation
dropped Quotation
into Quotation
a Quotation
church. Quotation
Suddenly, Quotation
to Quotation
my Quotation
surprise, Quotation
the Quotation
three Quotation
at Quotation
the Quotation
altar Quotation
faced Quotation
round Quotation
to Quotation
me, Quotation
and Quotation
Godfrey Quotation
Norton Quotation
came Quotation
running Quotation
as Quotation
hard Quotation
as Quotation
he Quotation
could Quotation
towards Quotation
me. Quotation
 Quotation
'Thank Quotation
God,' Quotation
he Quotation
cried. Quotation
'You'll Quotation
do. Quotation
Come! Quotation
Come!' Quotation
 Quotation
'What Quotation
then?' Quotation
I Quotation
asked. Quotation
 Quotation
'Come, Quotation
man, Quotation
come, Quotation
only Quotation
three Quotation
minutes, Quotation
or Quotation
it Quotation
won't Quotation
be Quotation
legal.' Quotation
 Quotation
I Quotation
was Quotation
half-dragged Quotation
up Quotation
to Quotation
the Quotation
altar, Quotation
and Quotation
before Quotation
I Quotation
knew Quotation
where Quotation
I Quotation
was Quotation
I Quotation
found Quotation
myself Quotation
mumbling Quotation
responses Quotation
which Quotation
were Quotation
whispered Quotation
in Quotation
my Quotation
ear, Quotation
and Quotation
vouching Quotation
for Quotation
things Quotation
of Quotation
which Quotation
I Quotation
knew Quotation
nothing, Quotation
and Quotation
generally Quotation
assisting Quotation
in Quotation
the Quotation
secure Quotation
tying Quotation
up Quotation
of Quotation
Irene Quotation
Adler, Quotation
spinster, Quotation
to Quotation
Godfrey Quotation
Norton, Quotation
bachelor. Quotation
It Quotation
was Quotation
all Quotation
done Quotation
in Quotation
an Quotation
instant, Quotation
and Quotation
there Quotation
was Quotation
the Quotation
gentleman Quotation
thanking Quotation
me Quotation
on Quotation
the Quotation
one Quotation
side Quotation
and Quotation
the Quotation
lady Quotation
on Quotation
the Quotation
other, Quotation
while Quotation
the Quotation
clergyman Quotation
beamed Quotation
on Quotation
me Quotation
in Quotation
front. Quotation
It Quotation
was Quotation
the Quotation
most Quotation
preposterous Quotation
position Quotation
in Quotation
which Quotation
I Quotation
ever Quotation
found Quotation
myself Quotation
in Quotation
my Quotation
life, Quotation
and Quotation
it Quotation
was Quotation
the Quotation
thought Quotation
of Quotation
it Quotation
that Quotation
started Quotation
me Quotation
laughing Quotation
just Quotation
now. Quotation
It Quotation
seems Quotation
that Quotation
there Quotation
had Quotation
been Quotation
some Quotation
informality Quotation
about Quotation
their Quotation
license, Quotation
that Quotation
the Quotation
clergyman Quotation
absolutely Quotation
refused Quotation
to Quotation
marry Quotation
them Quotation
without Quotation
a Quotation
witness Quotation
of Quotation
some Quotation
sort, Quotation
and Quotation
that Quotation
my Quotation
lucky Quotation
appearance Quotation
saved Quotation
the Quotation
bridegroom Quotation
from Quotation
having Quotation
to Quotation
sally Quotation
out Quotation
into Quotation
the Quotation
streets Quotation
in Quotation
search Quotation
of Quotation
a Quotation
best Quotation
man. Quotation
The Quotation
bride Quotation
gave Quotation
me Quotation
a Quotation
sovereign, Quotation
and Quotation
I Quotation
mean Quotation
to Quotation
wear Quotation
it Quotation
on Quotation
my Quotation
watch-chain Quotation
in Quotation
memory Quotation
of Quotation
the Quotation
occasion." Quotation
"This O
is O
a O
very O
unexpected O
turn O
of O
affairs," O
said O
I; O
"and O
what O
then?" O
"Well, O
I O
found O
my O
plans O
very O
seriously O
menaced. O
It O
looked O
as O
if O
the O
pair O
might O
take O
an O
immediate O
departure, O
and O
so O
necessitate O
very O
prompt O
and O
energetic O
measures O
on O
my O
part. O
At O
the O
church O
door, O
however, O
they O
separated, O
he O
driving O
back O
to O
the O
Temple, O
and O
she O
to O
her O
own O
house. O
'I O
shall O
drive O
out O
in O
the O
park O
at O
five O
as O
usual,' O
she O
said O
as O
she O
left O
him. O
I O
heard O
no O
more. O
They O
drove O
away O
in O
different O
directions, O
and O
I O
went O
off O
to O
make O
my O
own O
arrangements." O
"Which O
are?" O
"Some O
cold O
beef O
and O
a O
glass O
of O
beer," O
he O
answered, O
ringing O
the O
bell. O
"I O
have O
been O
too O
busy O
to O
think O
of O
food, O
and O
I O
am O
likely O
to O
be O
busier O
still O
this O
evening. O
By O
the O
way, O
Doctor, O
I O
shall O
want O
your O
co-operation." O
"I O
shall O
be O
delighted." O
"You O
don't O
mind O
breaking O
the O
law?" O
"Not O
in O
the O
least." O
"Nor O
running O
a O
chance O
of O
arrest?" O
"Not O
in O
a O
good O
cause." O
"Oh, O
the O
cause O
is O
excellent!" O
"Then O
I O
am O
your O
man." O
"I O
was O
sure O
that O
I O
might O
rely O
on O
you." O
"But O
what O
is O
it O
you O
wish?" O
"When O
Mrs. O
Turner O
has O
brought O
in O
the O
tray O
I O
will O
make O
it O
clear O
to O
you. O
Now," O
he O
said O
as O
he O
turned O
hungrily O
on O
the O
simple O
fare O
that O
our O
landlady O
had O
provided, O
"I O
must O
discuss O
it O
while O
I O
eat, O
for O
I O
have O
not O
much O
time. O
It O
is O
nearly O
five O
now. O
In O
two O
hours O
we O
must O
be O
on O
the O
scene O
of O
action. O
Miss O
Irene, O
or O
Madame, O
rather, O
returns O
from O
her O
drive O
at O
seven. O
We O
must O
be O
at O
Briony O
Lodge O
to O
meet O
her." O
"And O
what O
then?" O
"You O
must O
leave O
that O
to O
me. O
I O
have O
already O
arranged O
what O
is O
to O
occur. O
There O
is O
only O
one O
point O
on O
which O
I O
must O
insist. O
You O
must O
not O
interfere, O
come O
what O
may. O
You O
understand?" O
"I O
am O
to O
be O
neutral?" O
"To O
do O
nothing O
whatever. O
There O
will O
probably O
be O
some O
small O
unpleasantness. O
Do O
not O
join O
in O
it. O
It O
will O
end O
in O
my O
being O
conveyed O
into O
the O
house. O
Four O
or O
five O
minutes O
afterwards O
the O
sitting-room O
window O
will O
open. O
You O
are O
to O
station O
yourself O
close O
to O
that O
open O
window." O
"Yes." O
"You O
are O
to O
watch O
me, O
for O
I O
will O
be O
visible O
to O
you." O
"Yes." O
"And O
when O
I O
raise O
my O
hand-- O
so O
-- O
you O
will O
throw O
into O
the O
room O
what O
I O
give O
you O
to O
throw, O
and O
will, O
at O
the O
same O
time, O
raise O
the O
cry O
of O
fire. O
You O
quite O
follow O
me?" O
"Entirely." O
"It O
is O
nothing O
very O
formidable," O
he O
said, O
taking O
a O
long O
cigar- O
shaped O
roll O
from O
his O
pocket. O
"It O
is O
an O
ordinary O
plumber's O
smoke- O
rocket, O
fitted O
with O
a O
cap O
at O
either O
end O
to O
make O
it O
self-lighting. O
Your O
task O
is O
confined O
to O
that. O
When O
you O
raise O
your O
cry O
of O
fire, O
it O
will O
be O
taken O
up O
by O
quite O
a O
number O
of O
people. O
You O
may O
then O
walk O
to O
the O
end O
of O
the O
street, O
and O
I O
will O
rejoin O
you O
in O
ten O
minutes. O
I O
hope O
that O
I O
have O
made O
myself O
clear?" O
"I O
am O
to O
remain O
neutral, O
to O
get O
near O
the O
window, O
to O
watch O
you, O
and O
at O
the O
signal O
to O
throw O
in O
this O
object, O
then O
to O
raise O
the O
cry O
of O
fire, O
and O
to O
wait O
you O
at O
the O
corner O
of O
the O
street." O
"Precisely." O
"Then O
you O
may O
entirely O
rely O
on O
me." O
"That O
is O
excellent. O
I O
think, O
perhaps, O
it O
is O
almost O
time O
that O
I O
prepare O
for O
the O
new O
role O
I O
have O
to O
play." O
He O
disappeared O
into O
his O
bedroom O
and O
returned O
in O
a O
few O
minutes O
in O
the O
character O
of O
an O
amiable O
and O
simple-minded O
Nonconformist O
clergyman. O
His O
broad O
black O
hat, O
his O
baggy O
trousers, O
his O
white O
tie, O
his O
sympathetic O
smile, O
and O
general O
look O
of O
peering O
and O
benevolent O
curiosity O
were O
such O
as O
Mr. O
John O
Hare O
alone O
could O
have O
equalled. O
It O
was O
not O
merely O
that O
Holmes O
changed O
his O
costume. O
His O
expression, O
his O
manner, O
his O
very O
soul O
seemed O
to O
vary O
with O
every O
fresh O
part O
that O
he O
assumed. O
The O
stage O
lost O
a O
fine O
actor, O
even O
as O
science O
lost O
an O
acute O
reasoner, O
when O
he O
became O
a O
specialist O
in O
crime. O
It O
was O
a O
quarter O
past O
six O
when O
we O
left O
Baker O
Street, O
and O
it O
still O
wanted O
ten O
minutes O
to O
the O
hour O
when O
we O
found O
ourselves O
in O
Serpentine O
Avenue. O
It O
was O
already O
dusk, O
and O
the O
lamps O
were O
just O
being O
lighted O
as O
we O
paced O
up O
and O
down O
in O
front O
of O
Briony O
Lodge, O
waiting O
for O
the O
coming O
of O
its O
occupant. O
The O
house O
was O
just O
such O
as O
I O
had O
pictured O
it O
from O
Sherlock O
Holmes' O
succinct O
description, O
but O
the O
locality O
appeared O
to O
be O
less O
private O
than O
I O
expected. O
On O
the O
contrary, O
for O
a O
small O
street O
in O
a O
quiet O
neighbourhood, O
it O
was O
remarkably O
animated. O
There O
was O
a O
group O
of O
shabbily O
dressed O
men O
smoking O
and O
laughing O
in O
a O
corner, O
a O
scissors-grinder O
with O
his O
wheel, O
two O
guardsmen O
who O
were O
flirting O
with O
a O
nurse-girl, O
and O
several O
well-dressed O
young O
men O
who O
were O
lounging O
up O
and O
down O
with O
cigars O
in O
their O
mouths. O
"You O
see," O
remarked O
Holmes, O
as O
we O
paced O
to O
and O
fro O
in O
front O
of O
the O
house, O
"this O
marriage O
rather O
simplifies O
matters. O
The O
photograph O
becomes O
a O
double-edged O
weapon O
now. O
The O
chances O
are O
that O
she O
would O
be O
as O
averse O
to O
its O
being O
seen O
by O
Mr. O
Godfrey O
Norton, O
as O
our O
client O
is O
to O
its O
coming O
to O
the O
eyes O
of O
his O
princess. O
Now O
the O
question O
is, O
Where O
are O
we O
to O
find O
the O
photograph?" O
"Where, O
indeed?" O
"It O
is O
most O
unlikely O
that O
she O
carries O
it O
about O
with O
her. O
It O
is O
cabinet O
size. O
Too O
large O
for O
easy O
concealment O
about O
a O
woman's O
dress. O
She O
knows O
that O
the O
King O
is O
capable O
of O
having O
her O
waylaid O
and O
searched. O
Two O
attempts O
of O
the O
sort O
have O
already O
been O
made. O
We O
may O
take O
it, O
then, O
that O
she O
does O
not O
carry O
it O
about O
with O
her." O
"Where, O
then?" O
"Her O
banker O
or O
her O
lawyer. O
There O
is O
that O
double O
possibility. O
But O
I O
am O
inclined O
to O
think O
neither. O
Women O
are O
naturally O
secretive, O
and O
they O
like O
to O
do O
their O
own O
secreting. O
Why O
should O
she O
hand O
it O
over O
to O
anyone O
else? O
She O
could O
trust O
her O
own O
guardianship, O
but O
she O
could O
not O
tell O
what O
indirect O
or O
political O
influence O
might O
be O
brought O
to O
bear O
upon O
a O
business O
man. O
Besides, O
remember O
that O
she O
had O
resolved O
to O
use O
it O
within O
a O
few O
days. O
It O
must O
be O
where O
she O
can O
lay O
her O
hands O
upon O
it. O
It O
must O
be O
in O
her O
own O
house." O
"But O
it O
has O
twice O
been O
burgled." O
"Pshaw! O
They O
did O
not O
know O
how O
to O
look." O
"But O
how O
will O
you O
look?" O
"I O
will O
not O
look." O
"What O
then?" O
"I O
will O
get O
her O
to O
show O
me." O
"But O
she O
will O
refuse." O
"She O
will O
not O
be O
able O
to. O
But O
I O
hear O
the O
rumble O
of O
wheels. O
It O
is O
her O
carriage. O
Now O
carry O
out O
my O
orders O
to O
the O
letter." O
As O
he O
spoke O
the O
gleam O
of O
the O
side-lights O
of O
a O
carriage O
came O
round O
the O
curve O
of O
the O
avenue. O
It O
was O
a O
smart O
little O
landau O
which O
rattled O
up O
to O
the O
door O
of O
Briony O
Lodge. O
As O
it O
pulled O
up, O
one O
of O
the O
loafing O
men O
at O
the O
corner O
dashed O
forward O
to O
open O
the O
door O
in O
the O
hope O
of O
earning O
a O
copper, O
but O
was O
elbowed O
away O
by O
another O
loafer, O
who O
had O
rushed O
up O
with O
the O
same O
intention. O
A O
fierce O
quarrel O
broke O
out, O
which O
was O
increased O
by O
the O
two O
guardsmen, O
who O
took O
sides O
with O
one O
of O
the O
loungers, O
and O
by O
the O
scissors-grinder, O
who O
was O
equally O
hot O
upon O
the O
other O
side. O
A O
blow O
was O
struck, O
and O
in O
an O
instant O
the O
lady, O
who O
had O
stepped O
from O
her O
carriage, O
was O
the O
centre O
of O
a O
little O
knot O
of O
flushed O
and O
struggling O
men, O
who O
struck O
savagely O
at O
each O
other O
with O
their O
fists O
and O
sticks. O
Holmes O
dashed O
into O
the O
crowd O
to O
protect O
the O
lady; O
but O
just O
as O
he O
reached O
her O
he O
gave O
a O
cry O
and O
dropped O
to O
the O
ground, O
with O
the O
blood O
running O
freely O
down O
his O
face. O
At O
his O
fall O
the O
guardsmen O
took O
to O
their O
heels O
in O
one O
direction O
and O
the O
loungers O
in O
the O
other, O
while O
a O
number O
of O
better-dressed O
people, O
who O
had O
watched O
the O
scuffle O
without O
taking O
part O
in O
it, O
crowded O
in O
to O
help O
the O
lady O
and O
to O
attend O
to O
the O
injured O
man. O
Irene O
Adler, O
as O
I O
will O
still O
call O
her, O
had O
hurried O
up O
the O
steps; O
but O
she O
stood O
at O
the O
top O
with O
her O
superb O
figure O
outlined O
against O
the O
lights O
of O
the O
hall, O
looking O
back O
into O
the O
street. O
"Is O
the O
poor O
gentleman O
much O
hurt?" O
she O
asked. O
"He O
is O
dead," O
cried O
several O
voices. O
"No, O
no, O
there's O
life O
in O
him!" O
shouted O
another. O
"But O
he'll O
be O
gone O
before O
you O
can O
get O
him O
to O
hospital." O
"He's O
a O
brave O
fellow," O
said O
a O
woman. O
"They O
would O
have O
had O
the O
lady's O
purse O
and O
watch O
if O
it O
hadn't O
been O
for O
him. O
They O
were O
a O
gang, O
and O
a O
rough O
one, O
too. O
Ah, O
he's O
breathing O
now." O
"He O
can't O
lie O
in O
the O
street. O
May O
we O
bring O
him O
in, O
marm?" O
"Surely. O
Bring O
him O
into O
the O
sitting-room. O
There O
is O
a O
comfortable O
sofa. O
This O
way, O
please!" O
Slowly O
and O
solemnly O
he O
was O
borne O
into O
Briony O
Lodge O
and O
laid O
out O
in O
the O
principal O
room, O
while O
I O
still O
observed O
the O
proceedings O
from O
my O
post O
by O
the O
window. O
The O
lamps O
had O
been O
lit, O
but O
the O
blinds O
had O
not O
been O
drawn, O
so O
that O
I O
could O
see O
Holmes O
as O
he O
lay O
upon O
the O
couch. O
I O
do O
not O
know O
whether O
he O
was O
seized O
with O
compunction O
at O
that O
moment O
for O
the O
part O
he O
was O
playing, O
but O
I O
know O
that O
I O
never O
felt O
more O
heartily O
ashamed O
of O
myself O
in O
my O
life O
than O
when O
I O
saw O
the O
beautiful O
creature O
against O
whom O
I O
was O
conspiring, O
or O
the O
grace O
and O
kindliness O
with O
which O
she O
waited O
upon O
the O
injured O
man. O
And O
yet O
it O
would O
be O
the O
blackest O
treachery O
to O
Holmes O
to O
draw O
back O
now O
from O
the O
part O
which O
he O
had O
intrusted O
to O
me. O
I O
hardened O
my O
heart, O
and O
took O
the O
smoke-rocket O
from O
under O
my O
ulster. O
After O
all, O
I O
thought, O
we O
are O
not O
injuring O
her. O
We O
are O
but O
preventing O
her O
from O
injuring O
another. O
Holmes O
had O
sat O
up O
upon O
the O
couch, O
and O
I O
saw O
him O
motion O
like O
a O
man O
who O
is O
in O
need O
of O
air. O
A O
maid O
rushed O
across O
and O
threw O
open O
the O
window. O
At O
the O
same O
instant O
I O
saw O
him O
raise O
his O
hand O
and O
at O
the O
signal O
I O
tossed O
my O
rocket O
into O
the O
room O
with O
a O
cry O
of O
"Fire!" O
The O
word O
was O
no O
sooner O
out O
of O
my O
mouth O
than O
the O
whole O
crowd O
of O
spectators, O
well O
dressed O
and O
ill-- O
gentlemen, O
ostlers, O
and O
servant-maids-- O
joined O
in O
a O
general O
shriek O
of O
"Fire!" O
Thick O
clouds O
of O
smoke O
curled O
through O
the O
room O
and O
out O
at O
the O
open O
window. O
I O
caught O
a O
glimpse O
of O
rushing O
figures, O
and O
a O
moment O
later O
the O
voice O
of O
Holmes O
from O
within O
assuring O
them O
that O
it O
was O
a O
false O
alarm. O
Slipping O
through O
the O
shouting O
crowd O
I O
made O
my O
way O
to O
the O
corner O
of O
the O
street, O
and O
in O
ten O
minutes O
was O
rejoiced O
to O
find O
my O
friend's O
arm O
in O
mine, O
and O
to O
get O
away O
from O
the O
scene O
of O
uproar. O
He O
walked O
swiftly O
and O
in O
silence O
for O
some O
few O
minutes O
until O
we O
had O
turned O
down O
one O
of O
the O
quiet O
streets O
which O
lead O
towards O
the O
Edgeware O
Road. O
"You O
did O
it O
very O
nicely, O
Doctor," O
he O
remarked. O
"Nothing O
could O
have O
been O
better. O
It O
is O
all O
right." O
"You O
have O
the O
photograph?" O
"I O
know O
where O
it O
is." O
"And O
how O
did O
you O
find O
out?" O
"She O
showed O
me, O
as O
I O
told O
you O
she O
would." O
"I O
am O
still O
in O
the O
dark." O
"I O
do O
not O
wish O
to O
make O
a O
mystery," O
said O
he, O
laughing. O
"The O
matter O
was O
perfectly O
simple. O
You, O
of O
course, O
saw O
that O
everyone O
in O
the O
street O
was O
an O
accomplice. O
They O
were O
all O
engaged O
for O
the O
evening." O
"I O
guessed O
as O
much." O
"Then, O
when O
the O
row O
broke O
out, O
I O
had O
a O
little O
moist O
red O
paint O
in O
the O
palm O
of O
my O
hand. O
I O
rushed O
forward, O
fell O
down, O
clapped O
my O
hand O
to O
my O
face, O
and O
became O
a O
piteous O
spectacle. O
It O
is O
an O
old O
trick." O
"That O
also O
I O
could O
fathom." O
"Then O
they O
carried O
me O
in. O
She O
was O
bound O
to O
have O
me O
in. O
What O
else O
could O
she O
do? O
And O
into O
her O
sitting-room, O
which O
was O
the O
very O
room O
which O
I O
suspected. O
It O
lay O
between O
that O
and O
her O
bedroom, O
and O
I O
was O
determined O
to O
see O
which. O
They O
laid O
me O
on O
a O
couch, O
I O
motioned O
for O
air, O
they O
were O
compelled O
to O
open O
the O
window, O
and O
you O
had O
your O
chance." O
"How O
did O
that O
help O
you?" O
"It O
was O
all-important. O
When O
a O
woman O
thinks O
that O
her O
house O
is O
on O
fire, O
her O
instinct O
is O
at O
once O
to O
rush O
to O
the O
thing O
which O
she O
values O
most. O
It O
is O
a O
perfectly O
overpowering O
impulse, O
and O
I O
have O
more O
than O
once O
taken O
advantage O
of O
it. O
In O
the O
case O
of O
the O
Darlington O
substitution O
scandal O
it O
was O
of O
use O
to O
me, O
and O
also O
in O
the O
Arnsworth O
Castle O
business. O
A O
married O
woman O
grabs O
at O
her O
baby; O
an O
unmarried O
one O
reaches O
for O
her O
jewel-box. O
Now O
it O
was O
clear O
to O
me O
that O
our O
lady O
of O
to-day O
had O
nothing O
in O
the O
house O
more O
precious O
to O
her O
than O
what O
we O
are O
in O
quest O
of. O
She O
would O
rush O
to O
secure O
it. O
The O
alarm O
of O
fire O
was O
admirably O
done. O
The O
smoke O
and O
shouting O
were O
enough O
to O
shake O
nerves O
of O
steel. O
She O
responded O
beautifully. O
The O
photograph O
is O
in O
a O
recess O
behind O
a O
sliding O
panel O
just O
above O
the O
right O
bell-pull. O
She O
was O
there O
in O
an O
instant, O
and O
I O
caught O
a O
glimpse O
of O
it O
as O
she O
half-drew O
it O
out. O
When O
I O
cried O
out O
that O
it O
was O
a O
false O
alarm, O
she O
replaced O
it, O
glanced O
at O
the O
rocket, O
rushed O
from O
the O
room, O
and O
I O
have O
not O
seen O
her O
since. O
I O
rose, O
and, O
making O
my O
excuses, O
escaped O
from O
the O
house. O
I O
hesitated O
whether O
to O
attempt O
to O
secure O
the O
photograph O
at O
once; O
but O
the O
coachman O
had O
come O
in, O
and O
as O
he O
was O
watching O
me O
narrowly O
it O
seemed O
safer O
to O
wait. O
A O
little O
over-precipitance O
may O
ruin O
all." O
"And O
now?" O
I O
asked. O
"Our O
quest O
is O
practically O
finished. O
I O
shall O
call O
with O
the O
King O
to-morrow, O
and O
with O
you, O
if O
you O
care O
to O
come O
with O
us. O
We O
will O
be O
shown O
into O
the O
sitting-room O
to O
wait O
for O
the O
lady, O
but O
it O
is O
probable O
that O
when O
she O
comes O
she O
may O
find O
neither O
us O
nor O
the O
photograph. O
It O
might O
be O
a O
satisfaction O
to O
his O
Majesty O
to O
regain O
it O
with O
his O
own O
hands." O
"And O
when O
will O
you O
call?" O
"At O
eight O
in O
the O
morning. O
She O
will O
not O
be O
up, O
so O
that O
we O
shall O
have O
a O
clear O
field. O
Besides, O
we O
must O
be O
prompt, O
for O
this O
marriage O
may O
mean O
a O
complete O
change O
in O
her O
life O
and O
habits. O
I O
must O
wire O
to O
the O
King O
without O
delay." O
We O
had O
reached O
Baker O
Street O
and O
had O
stopped O
at O
the O
door. O
He O
was O
searching O
his O
pockets O
for O
the O
key O
when O
someone O
passing O
said: O
"Good-night, O
Mister O
Sherlock O
Holmes." O
There O
were O
several O
people O
on O
the O
pavement O
at O
the O
time, O
but O
the O
greeting O
appeared O
to O
come O
from O
a O
slim O
youth O
in O
an O
ulster O
who O
had O
hurried O
by. O
"I've O
heard O
that O
voice O
before," O
said O
Holmes, O
staring O
down O
the O
dimly O
lit O
street. O
"Now, O
I O
wonder O
who O
the O
deuce O
that O
could O
have O
been." O
III. O
I O
slept O
at O
Baker O
Street O
that O
night, O
and O
we O
were O
engaged O
upon O
our O
toast O
and O
coffee O
in O
the O
morning O
when O
the O
King O
of O
Bohemia O
rushed O
into O
the O
room. O
"You O
have O
really O
got O
it!" O
he O
cried, O
grasping O
Sherlock O
Holmes O
by O
either O
shoulder O
and O
looking O
eagerly O
into O
his O
face. O
"Not O
yet." O
"But O
you O
have O
hopes?" O
"I O
have O
hopes." O
"Then, O
come. O
I O
am O
all O
impatience O
to O
be O
gone." O
"We O
must O
have O
a O
cab." O
"No, O
my O
brougham O
is O
waiting." O
"Then O
that O
will O
simplify O
matters." O
We O
descended O
and O
started O
off O
once O
more O
for O
Briony O
Lodge. O
"Irene O
Adler O
is O
married," O
remarked O
Holmes. O
"Married! O
When?" O
"Yesterday." O
"But O
to O
whom?" O
"To O
an O
English O
lawyer O
named O
Norton." O
"But O
she O
could O
not O
love O
him." O
"I O
am O
in O
hopes O
that O
she O
does." O
"And O
why O
in O
hopes?" O
"Because O
it O
would O
spare O
your O
Majesty O
all O
fear O
of O
future O
annoyance. O
If O
the O
lady O
loves O
her O
husband, O
she O
does O
not O
love O
your O
Majesty. O
If O
she O
does O
not O
love O
your O
Majesty, O
there O
is O
no O
reason O
why O
she O
should O
interfere O
with O
your O
Majesty's O
plan." O
"It O
is O
true. O
And O
yet-- O
Well! O
I O
wish O
she O
had O
been O
of O
my O
own O
station! O
What O
a O
queen O
she O
would O
have O
made!" O
He O
relapsed O
into O
a O
moody O
silence, O
which O
was O
not O
broken O
until O
we O
drew O
up O
in O
Serpentine O
Avenue. O
The O
door O
of O
Briony O
Lodge O
was O
open, O
and O
an O
elderly O
woman O
stood O
upon O
the O
steps. O
She O
watched O
us O
with O
a O
sardonic O
eye O
as O
we O
stepped O
from O
the O
brougham. O
"Mr. O
Sherlock O
Holmes, O
I O
believe?" O
said O
she. O
"I O
am O
Mr. O
Holmes," O
answered O
my O
companion, O
looking O
at O
her O
with O
a O
questioning O
and O
rather O
startled O
gaze. O
"Indeed! O
My O
mistress O
told O
me O
that O
you O
were O
likely O
to O
call. O
She O
left O
this O
morning O
with O
her O
husband O
by O
the O
5:15 O
train O
from O
Charing O
Cross O
for O
the O
Continent." O
"What!" O
Sherlock O
Holmes O
staggered O
back, O
white O
with O
chagrin O
and O
surprise. O
"Do O
you O
mean O
that O
she O
has O
left O
England?" O
"Never O
to O
return." O
"And O
the O
papers?" O
asked O
the O
King O
hoarsely. O
"All O
is O
lost." O
"We O
shall O
see." O
He O
pushed O
past O
the O
servant O
and O
rushed O
into O
the O
drawing-room, O
followed O
by O
the O
King O
and O
myself. O
The O
furniture O
was O
scattered O
about O
in O
every O
direction, O
with O
dismantled O
shelves O
and O
open O
drawers, O
as O
if O
the O
lady O
had O
hurriedly O
ransacked O
them O
before O
her O
flight. O
Holmes O
rushed O
at O
the O
bell-pull, O
tore O
back O
a O
small O
sliding O
shutter, O
and, O
plunging O
in O
his O
hand, O
pulled O
out O
a O
photograph O
and O
a O
letter. O
The O
photograph O
was O
of O
Irene O
Adler O
herself O
in O
evening O
dress, O
the O
letter O
was O
superscribed O
to O
"Sherlock O
Holmes, O
Esq. O
To O
be O
left O
till O
called O
for." O
My O
friend O
tore O
it O
open O
and O
we O
all O
three O
read O
it O
together. O
It O
was O
dated O
at O
midnight O
of O
the O
preceding O
night O
and O
ran O
in O
this O
way: O
"MY O
DEAR O
MR. O
SHERLOCK O
HOLMES,-- O
YOU O
REALLY O
DID O
IT O
VERY O
WELL. O
YOU O
TOOK O
ME O
IN O
COMPLETELY. O
UNTIL O
AFTER O
THE O
ALARM O
OF O
FIRE, O
I O
HAD O
NOT O
A O
SUSPICION. O
BUT O
THEN, O
WHEN O
I O
FOUND O
HOW O
I O
HAD O
BETRAYED O
MYSELF, O
I O
BEGAN O
TO O
THINK. O
I O
HAD O
BEEN O
WARNED O
AGAINST O
YOU O
MONTHS O
AGO. O
I O
HAD O
BEEN O
TOLD O
THAT O
IF O
THE O
KING O
EMPLOYED O
AN O
AGENT O
IT O
WOULD O
CERTAINLY O
BE O
YOU. O
AND O
YOUR O
ADDRESS O
HAD O
BEEN O
GIVEN O
ME. O
YET, O
WITH O
ALL O
THIS, O
YOU O
MADE O
ME O
REVEAL O
WHAT O
YOU O
WANTED O
TO O
KNOW. O
EVEN O
AFTER O
I O
BECAME O
SUSPICIOUS, O
I O
FOUND O
IT O
HARD O
TO O
THINK O
EVIL O
OF O
SUCH O
A O
DEAR, O
KIND O
OLD O
CLERGYMAN. O
BUT, O
YOU O
KNOW, O
I O
HAVE O
BEEN O
TRAINED O
AS O
AN O
ACTRESS O
MYSELF. O
MALE O
COSTUME O
IS O
NOTHING O
NEW O
TO O
ME. O
I O
OFTEN O
TAKE O
ADVANTAGE O
OF O
THE O
FREEDOM O
WHICH O
IT O
GIVES. O
I O
SENT O
JOHN, O
THE O
COACHMAN, O
TO O
WATCH O
YOU, O
RAN O
UP O
STAIRS, O
GOT O
INTO O
MY O
WALKING-CLOTHES, O
AS O
I O
CALL O
THEM, O
AND O
CAME O
DOWN O
JUST O
AS O
YOU O
DEPARTED. O
 O
WELL, O
I O
FOLLOWED O
YOU O
TO O
YOUR O
DOOR, O
AND O
SO O
MADE O
SURE O
THAT O
I O
WAS O
REALLY O
AN O
OBJECT O
OF O
INTEREST O
TO O
THE O
CELEBRATED O
MR. O
SHERLOCK O
HOLMES. O
THEN O
I, O
RATHER O
IMPRUDENTLY, O
WISHED O
YOU O
GOOD-NIGHT, O
AND O
STARTED O
FOR O
THE O
TEMPLE O
TO O
SEE O
MY O
HUSBAND. O
 O
WE O
BOTH O
THOUGHT O
THE O
BEST O
RESOURCE O
WAS O
FLIGHT, O
WHEN O
PURSUED O
BY O
SO O
FORMIDABLE O
AN O
ANTAGONIST; O
SO O
YOU O
WILL O
FIND O
THE O
NEST O
EMPTY O
WHEN O
YOU O
CALL O
TO-MORROW. O
AS O
TO O
THE O
PHOTOGRAPH, O
YOUR O
CLIENT O
MAY O
REST O
IN O
PEACE. O
I O
LOVE O
AND O
AM O
LOVED O
BY O
A O
BETTER O
MAN O
THAN O
HE. O
THE O
KING O
MAY O
DO O
WHAT O
HE O
WILL O
WITHOUT O
HINDRANCE O
FROM O
ONE O
WHOM O
HE O
HAS O
CRUELLY O
WRONGED. O
I O
KEEP O
IT O
ONLY O
TO O
SAFEGUARD O
MYSELF, O
AND O
TO O
PRESERVE O
A O
WEAPON O
WHICH O
WILL O
ALWAYS O
SECURE O
ME O
FROM O
ANY O
STEPS O
WHICH O
HE O
MIGHT O
TAKE O
IN O
THE O
FUTURE. O
I O
LEAVE O
A O
PHOTOGRAPH O
WHICH O
HE O
MIGHT O
CARE O
TO O
POSSESS; O
AND O
I O
REMAIN, O
DEAR O
MR. O
SHERLOCK O
HOLMES, O
 O
VERY O
TRULY O
YOURS, O
 O
IRENE O
NORTON, O
NéE O
ADLER." O
"What O
a O
woman-- O
oh, O
what O
a O
woman!" O
cried O
the O
King O
of O
Bohemia, O
when O
we O
had O
all O
three O
read O
this O
epistle. O
"Did O
I O
not O
tell O
you O
how O
quick O
and O
resolute O
she O
was? O
Would O
she O
not O
have O
made O
an O
admirable O
queen? O
Is O
it O
not O
a O
pity O
that O
she O
was O
not O
on O
my O
level?" O
"From O
what O
I O
have O
seen O
of O
the O
lady O
she O
seems O
indeed O
to O
be O
on O
a O
very O
different O
level O
to O
your O
Majesty," O
said O
Holmes O
coldly. O
"I O
am O
sorry O
that O
I O
have O
not O
been O
able O
to O
bring O
your O
Majesty's O
business O
to O
a O
more O
successful O
conclusion." O
"On O
the O
contrary, O
my O
dear O
sir," O
cried O
the O
King; O
"nothing O
could O
be O
more O
successful. O
I O
know O
that O
her O
word O
is O
inviolate. O
The O
photograph O
is O
now O
as O
safe O
as O
if O
it O
were O
in O
the O
fire." O
"I O
am O
glad O
to O
hear O
your O
Majesty O
say O
so." O
"I O
am O
immensely O
indebted O
to O
you. O
Pray O
tell O
me O
in O
what O
way O
I O
can O
reward O
you. O
This O
ring O
-- O
" O
He O
slipped O
an O
emerald O
snake O
ring O
from O
his O
finger O
and O
held O
it O
out O
upon O
the O
palm O
of O
his O
hand. O
"Your O
Majesty O
has O
something O
which O
I O
should O
value O
even O
more O
highly," O
said O
Holmes. O
"You O
have O
but O
to O
name O
it." O
"This O
photograph!" O
The O
King O
stared O
at O
him O
in O
amazement. O
"Irene's O
photograph!" O
he O
cried. O
"Certainly, O
if O
you O
wish O
it." O
"I O
thank O
your O
Majesty. O
Then O
there O
is O
no O
more O
to O
be O
done O
in O
the O
matter. O
I O
have O
the O
honour O
to O
wish O
you O
a O
very O
good-morning." O
He O
bowed, O
and, O
turning O
away O
without O
observing O
the O
hand O
which O
the O
King O
had O
stretched O
out O
to O
him, O
he O
set O
off O
in O
my O
company O
for O
his O
chambers. O
And O
that O
was O
how O
a O
great O
scandal O
threatened O
to O
affect O
the O
kingdom O
of O
Bohemia, O
and O
how O
the O
best O
plans O
of O
Mr. O
Sherlock O
Holmes O
were O
beaten O
by O
a O
woman's O
wit. O
He O
used O
to O
make O
merry O
over O
the O
cleverness O
of O
women, O
but O
I O
have O
not O
heard O
him O
do O
it O
of O
late. O
And O
when O
he O
speaks O
of O
Irene O
Adler, O
or O
when O
he O
refers O
to O
her O
photograph, O
it O
is O
always O
under O
the O
honourable O
title O
of O
the O
woman. O

 O

 O
PART O
I O
CHAPTER O
ONE O
We O
were O
in O
class O
when O
the O
head-master O
came O
in, O
followed O
by O
a O
"new O
fellow," O
not O
wearing O
the O
school O
uniform, O
and O
a O
school O
servant O
carrying O
a O
large O
desk. O
Those O
who O
had O
been O
asleep O
woke O
up, O
and O
every O
one O
rose O
as O
if O
just O
surprised O
at O
his O
work. O
The O
head-master O
made O
a O
sign O
to O
us O
to O
sit O
down. O
Then, O
turning O
to O
the O
class-master, O
he Entity
said Cue
to O
him Entity
in O
a O
low O
voice-- O
"Monsieur Quotation
Roger, Quotation
here Quotation
is Quotation
a Quotation
pupil Quotation
whom Quotation
I Quotation
recommend Quotation
to Quotation
your Quotation
care; Quotation
he'll Quotation
be Quotation
in Quotation
the Quotation
second. Quotation
If Quotation
his Quotation
work Quotation
and Quotation
conduct Quotation
are Quotation
satisfactory, Quotation
he Quotation
will Quotation
go Quotation
into Quotation
one Quotation
of Quotation
the Quotation
upper Quotation
classes, Quotation
as Quotation
becomes Quotation
his Quotation
age." Quotation
The O
"new O
fellow," O
standing O
in O
the O
corner O
behind O
the O
door O
so O
that O
he O
could O
hardly O
be O
seen, O
was O
a O
country O
lad O
of O
about O
fifteen, O
and O
taller O
than O
any O
of O
us. O
His O
hair O
was O
cut O
square O
on O
his O
forehead O
like O
a O
village O
chorister's; O
he O
looked O
reliable, O
but O
very O
ill O
at O
ease. O
Although O
he O
was O
not O
broad-shouldered, O
his O
short O
school O
jacket O
of O
green O
cloth O
with O
black O
buttons O
must O
have O
been O
tight O
about O
the O
arm-holes, O
and O
showed O
at O
the O
opening O
of O
the O
cuffs O
red O
wrists O
accustomed O
to O
being O
bare. O
His O
legs, O
in O
blue O
stockings, O
looked O
out O
from O
beneath O
yellow O
trousers, O
drawn O
tight O
by O
braces, O
He O
wore O
stout, O
ill-cleaned, O
hob-nailed O
boots. O
We O
began O
repeating O
the O
lesson. O
He O
listened O
with O
all O
his O
ears, O
as O
attentive O
as O
if O
at O
a O
sermon, O
not O
daring O
even O
to O
cross O
his O
legs O
or O
lean O
on O
his O
elbow; O
and O
when O
at O
two O
o'clock O
the O
bell O
rang, O
the O
master O
was O
obliged O
to O
tell O
him O
to O
fall O
into O
line O
with O
the O
rest O
of O
us. O
When O
we O
came O
back O
to O
work, O
we O
were O
in O
the O
habit O
of O
throwing O
our O
caps O
on O
the O
ground O
so O
as O
to O
have O
our O
hands O
more O
free; O
we O
used O
from O
the O
door O
to O
toss O
them O
under O
the O
form, O
so O
that O
they O
hit O
against O
the O
wall O
and O
made O
a O
lot O
of O
dust: O
it O
was O
"the O
thing." O
But, O
whether O
he O
had O
not O
noticed O
the O
trick, O
or O
did O
not O
dare O
to O
attempt O
it, O
the O
"new O
fellow," O
was O
still O
holding O
his O
cap O
on O
his O
knees O
even O
after O
prayers O
were O
over. O
It O
was O
one O
of O
those O
head-gears O
of O
composite O
order, O
in O
which O
we O
can O
find O
traces O
of O
the O
bearskin, O
shako, O
billycock O
hat, O
sealskin O
cap, O
and O
cotton O
night-cap; O
one O
of O
those O
poor O
things, O
in O
fine, O
whose O
dumb O
ugliness O
has O
depths O
of O
expression, O
like O
an O
imbecile's O
face. O
Oval, O
stiffened O
with O
whalebone, O
it O
began O
with O
three O
round O
knobs; O
then O
came O
in O
succession O
lozenges O
of O
velvet O
and O
rabbit-skin O
separated O
by O
a O
red O
band; O
after O
that O
a O
sort O
of O
bag O
that O
ended O
in O
a O
cardboard O
polygon O
covered O
with O
complicated O
braiding, O
from O
which O
hung, O
at O
the O
end O
of O
a O
long O
thin O
cord, O
small O
twisted O
gold O
threads O
in O
the O
manner O
of O
a O
tassel. O
The O
cap O
was O
new; O
its O
peak O
shone. O
"Rise," Quotation
said Cue
the Entity
master. Entity
He Entity
stood O
up; O
his O
cap O
fell. O
The O
whole O
class O
began O
to O
laugh. O
He O
stooped O
to O
pick O
it O
up. O
A O
neighbor O
knocked O
it O
down O
again O
with O
his O
elbow; O
he O
picked O
it O
up O
once O
more. O
"Get Quotation
rid Quotation
of Quotation
your Quotation
helmet," Quotation
said Cue
the Entity
master, Entity
who O
was O
a O
bit O
of O
a O
wag. O
There O
was O
a O
burst O
of O
laughter O
from O
the O
boys, O
which O
so O
thoroughly O
put O
the O
poor O
lad O
out O
of O
countenance O
that O
he O
did O
not O
know O
whether O
to O
keep O
his O
cap O
in O
his O
hand, O
leave O
it O
on O
the O
ground, O
or O
put O
it O
on O
his O
head. O
He Entity
sat O
down O
again O
and O
placed O
it O
on O
his O
knee. O
"Rise," Quotation
repeated Cue
the Entity
master, Entity
"and Quotation
tell Quotation
me Quotation
your Quotation
name." Quotation
The Entity
new Entity
boy Entity
articulated Cue
in O
a O
stammering O
voice O
an Quotation
unintelligible Quotation
name. Quotation
"Again!" Quotation
The O
same O
sputtering O
of O
syllables O
was O
heard, O
drowned O
by O
the O
tittering O
of O
the O
class. O
"Louder!" Quotation
cried Cue
the Entity
master; Entity
"louder!" Quotation
The O
"new Entity
fellow" Entity
then O
took O
a O
supreme O
resolution, O
opened O
an O
inordinately O
large O
mouth, O
and O
shouted Cue
at O
the O
top O
of O
his O
voice O
as O
if O
calling O
someone O
in O
the O
word O
"Charbovari." Quotation
A O
hubbub O
broke O
out, O
rose O
in O
crescendo O
with O
bursts O
of O
shrill O
voices O
(they O
yelled, O
barked, O
stamped, O
repeated O
"Charbovari! O
Charbovari"), O
then O
died O
away O
into O
single O
notes, O
growing O
quieter O
only O
with O
great O
difficulty, O
and O
now O
and O
again O
suddenly O
recommencing O
along O
the O
line O
of O
a O
form O
whence O
rose O
here O
and O
there, O
like O
a O
damp O
cracker O
going O
off, O
a O
stifled O
laugh. O
However, O
amid O
a O
rain O
of O
impositions, O
order O
was O
gradually O
re-established O
in O
the O
class; O
and O
the O
master O
having O
succeeded O
in O
catching O
the O
name O
of O
"Charles O
Bovary," O
having O
had O
it O
dictated O
to O
him, O
spelt O
out, O
and O
re-read, O
at O
once O
ordered O
the O
poor O
devil O
to O
go O
and O
sit O
down O
on O
the O
punishment O
form O
at O
the O
foot O
of O
the O
master's O
desk. O
He O
got O
up, O
but O
before O
going O
hesitated. O
"What O
are O
you O
looking O
for?" O
asked O
the O
master. O
"My O
c-a-p," O
timidly O
said O
the O
"new O
fellow," O
casting O
troubled O
looks O
round O
him. O
"Five O
hundred O
lines O
for O
all O
the O
class!" O
shouted O
in O
a O
furious O
voice O
stopped, O
like O
the O
Quos O
ego, O
a O
fresh O
outburst. O
"Silence!" O
continued O
the O
master O
indignantly, O
wiping O
his O
brow O
with O
his O
handkerchief, O
which O
he O
had O
just O
taken O
from O
his O
cap. O
"As O
to O
you, O
'new O
boy,' O
you O
will O
conjugate O
'ridiculus O
sum' O
twenty O
times." O
Then, O
in O
a O
gentler O
tone, O
"Come, O
you'll O
find O
your O
cap O
again; O
it O
hasn't O
been O
stolen." O
A O
QUOTATION O
FROM O
THE O
AENEID O
SIGNIFYING O
A O
THREAT. O
I O
AM O
RIDICULOUS. O
Quiet O
was O
restored. O
Heads O
bent O
over O
desks, O
and O
the O
"new O
fellow" O
remained O
for O
two O
hours O
in O
an O
exemplary O
attitude, O
although O
from O
time O
to O
time O
some O
paper O
pellet O
flipped O
from O
the O
tip O
of O
a O
pen O
came O
bang O
in O
his O
face. O
But O
he O
wiped O
his O
face O
with O
one O
hand O
and O
continued O
motionless, O
his O
eyes O
lowered. O
In O
the O
evening, O
at O
preparation, O
he O
pulled O
out O
his O
pens O
from O
his O
desk, O
arranged O
his O
small O
belongings, O
and O
carefully O
ruled O
his O
paper. O
We O
saw O
him O
working O
conscientiously, O
looking O
up O
every O
word O
in O
the O
dictionary, O
and O
taking O
the O
greatest O
pains. O
Thanks, O
no O
doubt, O
to O
the O
willingness O
he O
showed, O
he O
had O
not O
to O
go O
down O
to O
the O
class O
below. O
But O
though O
he O
knew O
his O
rules O
passably, O
he O
had O
little O
finish O
in O
composition. O
It O
was O
the O
cure O
of O
his O
village O
who O
had O
taught O
him O
his O
first O
Latin; O
his O
parents, O
from O
motives O
of O
economy, O
having O
sent O
him O
to O
school O
as O
late O
as O
possible. O
His O
father, O
Monsieur O
Charles O
Denis O
Bartolome O
Bovary, O
retired O
assistant-surgeon-major, O
compromised O
about O
1812 O
in O
certain O
conscription O
scandals, O
and O
forced O
at O
this O
time O
to O
leave O
the O
service, O
had O
taken O
advantage O
of O
his O
fine O
figure O
to O
get O
hold O
of O
a O
dowry O
of O
sixty O
thousand O
francs O
that O
offered O
in O
the O
person O
of O
a O
hosier's O
daughter O
who O
had O
fallen O
in O
love O
with O
his O
good O
looks. O
A O
fine O
man, O
a O
great O
talker, O
making O
his O
spurs O
ring O
as O
he O
walked, O
wearing O
whiskers O
that O
ran O
into O
his O
moustache, O
his O
fingers O
always O
garnished O
with O
rings O
and O
dressed O
in O
loud O
colours, O
he O
had O
the O
dash O
of O
a O
military O
man O
with O
the O
easy O
go O
of O
a O
commercial O
traveller. O
Once O
married, O
he O
lived O
for O
three O
or O
four O
years O
on O
his O
wife's O
fortune, O
dining O
well, O
rising O
late, O
smoking O
long O
porcelain O
pipes, O
not O
coming O
in O
at O
night O
till O
after O
the O
theatre, O
and O
haunting O
cafes. O
The O
father-in-law O
died, O
leaving O
little; O
he O
was O
indignant O
at O
this, O
"went O
in O
for O
the O
business," O
lost O
some O
money O
in O
it, O
then O
retired O
to O
the O
country, O
where O
he O
thought O
he O
would O
make O
money. O
But, O
as O
he O
knew O
no O
more O
about O
farming O
than O
calico, O
as O
he O
rode O
his O
horses O
instead O
of O
sending O
them O
to O
plough, O
drank O
his O
cider O
in O
bottle O
instead O
of O
selling O
it O
in O
cask, O
ate O
the O
finest O
poultry O
in O
his O
farmyard, O
and O
greased O
his O
hunting-boots O
with O
the O
fat O
of O
his O
pigs, O
he O
was O
not O
long O
in O
finding O
out O
that O
he O
would O
do O
better O
to O
give O
up O
all O
speculation. O
For O
two O
hundred O
francs O
a O
year O
he O
managed O
to O
live O
on O
the O
border O
of O
the O
provinces O
of O
Caux O
and O
Picardy, O
in O
a O
kind O
of O
place O
half O
farm, O
half O
private O
house; O
and O
here, O
soured, O
eaten O
up O
with O
regrets, O
cursing O
his O
luck, O
jealous O
of O
everyone, O
he O
shut O
himself O
up O
at O
the O
age O
of O
forty-five, O
sick O
of O
men, O
he O
said, O
and O
determined O
to O
live O
at O
peace. O
His O
wife O
had O
adored O
him O
once O
on O
a O
time; O
she O
had O
bored O
him O
with O
a O
thousand O
servilities O
that O
had O
only O
estranged O
him O
the O
more. O
Lively O
once, O
expansive O
and O
affectionate, O
in O
growing O
older O
she O
had O
become O
(after O
the O
fashion O
of O
wine O
that, O
exposed O
to O
air, O
turns O
to O
vinegar) O
ill-tempered, O
grumbling, O
irritable. O
She O
had O
suffered O
so O
much O
without O
complaint O
at O
first, O
until O
she O
had O
seem O
him O
going O
after O
all O
the O
village O
drabs, O
and O
until O
a O
score O
of O
bad O
houses O
sent O
him O
back O
to O
her O
at O
night, O
weary, O
stinking O
drunk. O
Then O
her O
pride O
revolted. O
After O
that O
she O
was O
silent, O
burying O
her O
anger O
in O
a O
dumb O
stoicism O
that O
she O
maintained O
till O
her O
death. O
She O
was O
constantly O
going O
about O
looking O
after O
business O
matters. O
She O
called O
on O
the O
lawyers, O
the O
president, O
remembered O
when O
bills O
fell O
due, O
got O
them O
renewed, O
and O
at O
home O
ironed, O
sewed, O
washed, O
looked O
after O
the O
workmen, O
paid O
the O
accounts, O
while O
he, O
troubling O
himself O
about O
nothing, O
eternally O
besotted O
in O
sleepy O
sulkiness, O
whence O
he O
only O
roused O
himself O
to O
say O
disagreeable O
things O
to O
her, O
sat O
smoking O
by O
the O
fire O
and O
spitting O
into O
the O
cinders. O
When O
she O
had O
a O
child, O
it O
had O
to O
be O
sent O
out O
to O
nurse. O
When O
he O
came O
home, O
the O
lad O
was O
spoilt O
as O
if O
he O
were O
a O
prince. O
His O
mother O
stuffed O
him O
with O
jam; O
his O
father O
let O
him O
run O
about O
barefoot, O
and, O
playing O
the O
philosopher, O
even O
said O
he O
might O
as O
well O
go O
about O
quite O
naked O
like O
the O
young O
of O
animals. O
As O
opposed O
to O
the O
maternal O
ideas, O
he O
had O
a O
certain O
virile O
idea O
of O
childhood O
on O
which O
he O
sought O
to O
mould O
his O
son, O
wishing O
him O
to O
be O
brought O
up O
hardily, O
like O
a O
Spartan, O
to O
give O
him O
a O
strong O
constitution. O
He O
sent O
him O
to O
bed O
without O
any O
fire, O
taught O
him O
to O
drink O
off O
large O
draughts O
of O
rum O
and O
to O
jeer O
at O
religious O
processions. O
But, O
peaceable O
by O
nature, O
the O
lad O
answered O
only O
poorly O
to O
his O
notions. O
His O
mother O
always O
kept O
him O
near O
her; O
she O
cut O
out O
cardboard O
for O
him, O
told O
him O
tales, O
entertained O
him O
with O
endless O
monologues O
full O
of O
melancholy O
gaiety O
and O
charming O
nonsense. O
In O
her O
life's O
isolation O
she O
centered O
on O
the O
child's O
head O
all O
her O
shattered, O
broken O
little O
vanities. O
She O
dreamed O
of O
high O
station; O
she O
already O
saw O
him, O
tall, O
handsome, O
clever, O
settled O
as O
an O
engineer O
or O
in O
the O
law. O
She O
taught O
him O
to O
read, O
and O
even, O
on O
an O
old O
piano, O
she O
had O
taught O
him O
two O
or O
three O
little O
songs. O
But O
to O
all O
this O
Monsieur O
Bovary, O
caring O
little O
for O
letters, O
said, O
"It O
was O
not O
worth O
while. O
Would O
they O
ever O
have O
the O
means O
to O
send O
him O
to O
a O
public O
school, O
to O
buy O
him O
a O
practice, O
or O
start O
him O
in O
business? O
Besides, O
with O
cheek O
a O
man O
always O
gets O
on O
in O
the O
world." O
Madame O
Bovary O
bit O
her O
lips, O
and O
the O
child O
knocked O
about O
the O
village. O
He O
went O
after O
the O
labourers, O
drove O
away O
with O
clods O
of O
earth O
the O
ravens O
that O
were O
flying O
about. O
He O
ate O
blackberries O
along O
the O
hedges, O
minded O
the O
geese O
with O
a O
long O
switch, O
went O
haymaking O
during O
harvest, O
ran O
about O
in O
the O
woods, O
played O
hop-scotch O
under O
the O
church O
porch O
on O
rainy O
days, O
and O
at O
great O
fetes O
begged O
the O
beadle O
to O
let O
him O
toll O
the O
bells, O
that O
he O
might O
hang O
all O
his O
weight O
on O
the O
long O
rope O
and O
feel O
himself O
borne O
upward O
by O
it O
in O
its O
swing. O
Meanwhile O
he O
grew O
like O
an O
oak; O
he O
was O
strong O
on O
hand, O
fresh O
of O
colour. O
When O
he O
was O
twelve O
years O
old O
his O
mother O
had O
her O
own O
way; O
he O
began O
lessons. O
The O
cure O
took O
him O
in O
hand; O
but O
the O
lessons O
were O
so O
short O
and O
irregular O
that O
they O
could O
not O
be O
of O
much O
use. O
They O
were O
given O
at O
spare O
moments O
in O
the O
sacristy, O
standing O
up, O
hurriedly, O
between O
a O
baptism O
and O
a O
burial; O
or O
else O
the O
cure, O
if O
he O
had O
not O
to O
go O
out, O
sent O
for O
his O
pupil O
after O
the O
Angelus. O
They O
went O
up O
to O
his O
room O
and O
settled O
down; O
the O
flies O
and O
moths O
fluttered O
round O
the O
candle. O
It O
was O
close, O
the O
child O
fell O
asleep, O
and O
the O
good O
man, O
beginning O
to O
doze O
with O
his O
hands O
on O
his O
stomach, O
was O
soon O
snoring O
with O
his O
mouth O
wide O
open. O
On O
other O
occasions, O
when O
Monsieur O
le O
Cure, O
on O
his O
way O
back O
after O
administering O
the O
viaticum O
to O
some O
sick O
person O
in O
the O
neighbourhood, O
caught O
sight O
of O
Charles O
playing O
about O
the O
fields, O
he O
called O
him, O
lectured O
him O
for O
a O
quarter O
of O
an O
hour O
and O
took O
advantage O
of O
the O
occasion O
to O
make O
him O
conjugate O
his O
verb O
at O
the O
foot O
of O
a O
tree. O
The O
rain O
interrupted O
them O
or O
an O
acquaintance O
passed. O
All O
the O
same O
he O
was O
always O
pleased O
with O
him, O
and O
even O
said O
the O
"young O
man" O
had O
a O
very O
good O
memory. O
A O
DEVOTION O
SAID O
AT O
MORNING, O
NOON, O
AND O
EVENING, O
AT O
THE O
SOUND O
OF O
A O
BELL. O
HERE, O
THE O
EVENING O
PRAYER. O
Charles O
could O
not O
go O
on O
like O
this. O
Madame O
Bovary O
took O
strong O
steps. O
Ashamed, O
or O
rather O
tired O
out, O
Monsieur O
Bovary O
gave O
in O
without O
a O
struggle, O
and O
they O
waited O
one O
year O
longer, O
so O
that O
the O
lad O
should O
take O
his O
first O
communion. O
Six O
months O
more O
passed, O
and O
the O
year O
after O
Charles O
was O
finally O
sent O
to O
school O
at O
Rouen, O
where O
his O
father O
took O
him O
towards O
the O
end O
of O
October, O
at O
the O
time O
of O
the O
St. O
Romain O
fair. O
It O
would O
now O
be O
impossible O
for O
any O
of O
us O
to O
remember O
anything O
about O
him. O
He O
was O
a O
youth O
of O
even O
temperament, O
who O
played O
in O
playtime, O
worked O
in O
school-hours, O
was O
attentive O
in O
class, O
slept O
well O
in O
the O
dormitory, O
and O
ate O
well O
in O
the O
refectory. O
He O
had O
in O
loco O
parentis O
a O
wholesale O
ironmonger O
in O
the O
Rue O
Ganterie, O
who O
took O
him O
out O
once O
a O
month O
on O
Sundays O
after O
his O
shop O
was O
shut, O
sent O
him O
for O
a O
walk O
on O
the O
quay O
to O
look O
at O
the O
boats, O
and O
then O
brought O
him O
back O
to O
college O
at O
seven O
o'clock O
before O
supper. O
Every O
Thursday O
evening O
he O
wrote O
a O
long O
letter O
to O
his O
mother O
with O
red O
ink O
and O
three O
wafers; O
then O
he O
went O
over O
his O
history O
note-books, O
or O
read O
an O
old O
volume O
of O
"Anarchasis" O
that O
was O
knocking O
about O
the O
study. O
When O
he O
went O
for O
walks O
he O
talked O
to O
the O
servant, O
who, O
like O
himself, O
came O
from O
the O
country. O
IN O
PLACE O
OF O
A O
PARENT. O
By O
dint O
of O
hard O
work O
he O
kept O
always O
about O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
class; O
once O
even O
he O
got O
a O
certificate O
in O
natural O
history. O
But O
at O
the O
end O
of O
his O
third O
year O
his O
parents O
withdrew O
him O
from O
the O
school O
to O
make O
him O
study O
medicine, O
convinced O
that O
he O
could O
even O
take O
his O
degree O
by O
himself. O
His O
mother O
chose O
a O
room O
for O
him O
on O
the O
fourth O
floor O
of O
a O
dyer's O
she O
knew, O
overlooking O
the O
Eau-de-Robec. O
She O
made O
arrangements O
for O
his O
board, O
got O
him O
furniture, O
table O
and O
two O
chairs, O
sent O
home O
for O
an O
old O
cherry-tree O
bedstead, O
and O
bought O
besides O
a O
small O
cast-iron O
stove O
with O
the O
supply O
of O
wood O
that O
was O
to O
warm O
the O
poor O
child. O
Then O
at O
the O
end O
of O
a O
week O
she O
departed, O
after O
a O
thousand O
injunctions O
to O
be O
good O
now O
that O
he O
was O
going O
to O
be O
left O
to O
himself. O
The O
syllabus O
that O
he O
read O
on O
the O
notice-board O
stunned O
him; O
lectures O
on O
anatomy, O
lectures O
on O
pathology, O
lectures O
on O
physiology, O
lectures O
on O
pharmacy, O
lectures O
on O
botany O
and O
clinical O
medicine, O
and O
therapeutics, O
without O
counting O
hygiene O
and O
materia O
medica-- O
all O
names O
of O
whose O
etymologies O
he O
was O
ignorant, O
and O
that O
were O
to O
him O
as O
so O
many O
doors O
to O
sanctuaries O
filled O
with O
magnificent O
darkness. O
He O
understood O
nothing O
of O
it O
all; O
it O
was O
all O
very O
well O
to O
listen-- O
he O
did O
not O
follow. O
Still O
he O
worked; O
he O
had O
bound O
note-books, O
he O
attended O
all O
the O
courses, O
never O
missed O
a O
single O
lecture. O
He O
did O
his O
little O
daily O
task O
like O
a O
mill-horse, O
who O
goes O
round O
and O
round O
with O
his O
eyes O
bandaged, O
not O
knowing O
what O
work O
he O
is O
doing. O
To O
spare O
him O
expense O
his O
mother O
sent O
him O
every O
week O
by O
the O
carrier O
a O
piece O
of O
veal O
baked O
in O
the O
oven, O
with O
which O
he O
lunched O
when O
he O
came O
back O
from O
the O
hospital, O
while O
he O
sat O
kicking O
his O
feet O
against O
the O
wall. O
After O
this O
he O
had O
to O
run O
off O
to O
lectures, O
to O
the O
operation-room, O
to O
the O
hospital, O
and O
return O
to O
his O
home O
at O
the O
other O
end O
of O
the O
town. O
In O
the O
evening, O
after O
the O
poor O
dinner O
of O
his O
landlord, O
he O
went O
back O
to O
his O
room O
and O
set O
to O
work O
again O
in O
his O
wet O
clothes, O
which O
smoked O
as O
he O
sat O
in O
front O
of O
the O
hot O
stove. O
On O
the O
fine O
summer O
evenings, O
at O
the O
time O
when O
the O
close O
streets O
are O
empty, O
when O
the O
servants O
are O
playing O
shuttle-cock O
at O
the O
doors, O
he O
opened O
his O
window O
and O
leaned O
out. O
The O
river, O
that O
makes O
of O
this O
quarter O
of O
Rouen O
a O
wretched O
little O
Venice, O
flowed O
beneath O
him, O
between O
the O
bridges O
and O
the O
railings, O
yellow, O
violet, O
or O
blue. O
Working O
men, O
kneeling O
on O
the O
banks, O
washed O
their O
bare O
arms O
in O
the O
water. O
On O
poles O
projecting O
from O
the O
attics, O
skeins O
of O
cotton O
were O
drying O
in O
the O
air. O
Opposite, O
beyond O
the O
roots O
spread O
the O
pure O
heaven O
with O
the O
red O
sun O
setting. O
How O
pleasant O
it O
must O
be O
at O
home! O
How O
fresh O
under O
the O
beech-tree! O
And O
he O
expanded O
his O
nostrils O
to O
breathe O
in O
the O
sweet O
odours O
of O
the O
country O
which O
did O
not O
reach O
him. O
He O
grew O
thin, O
his O
figure O
became O
taller, O
his O
face O
took O
a O
saddened O
look O
that O
made O
it O
nearly O
interesting. O
Naturally, O
through O
indifference, O
he O
abandoned O
all O
the O
resolutions O
he O
had O
made. O
Once O
he O
missed O
a O
lecture; O
the O
next O
day O
all O
the O
lectures; O
and, O
enjoying O
his O
idleness, O
little O
by O
little, O
he O
gave O
up O
work O
altogether. O
He O
got O
into O
the O
habit O
of O
going O
to O
the O
public-house, O
and O
had O
a O
passion O
for O
dominoes. O
To O
shut O
himself O
up O
every O
evening O
in O
the O
dirty O
public O
room, O
to O
push O
about O
on O
marble O
tables O
the O
small O
sheep O
bones O
with O
black O
dots, O
seemed O
to O
him O
a O
fine O
proof O
of O
his O
freedom, O
which O
raised O
him O
in O
his O
own O
esteem. O
It O
was O
beginning O
to O
see O
life, O
the O
sweetness O
of O
stolen O
pleasures; O
and O
when O
he O
entered, O
he O
put O
his O
hand O
on O
the O
door-handle O
with O
a O
joy O
almost O
sensual. O
Then O
many O
things O
hidden O
within O
him O
came O
out; O
he O
learnt O
couplets O
by O
heart O
and O
sang O
them O
to O
his O
boon O
companions, O
became O
enthusiastic O
about O
Beranger, O
learnt O
how O
to O
make O
punch, O
and, O
finally, O
how O
to O
make O
love. O
Thanks O
to O
these O
preparatory O
labours, O
he O
failed O
completely O
in O
his O
examination O
for O
an O
ordinary O
degree. O
He O
was O
expected O
home O
the O
same O
night O
to O
celebrate O
his O
success. O
He O
started O
on O
foot, O
stopped O
at O
the O
beginning O
of O
the O
village, O
sent O
for O
his O
mother, O
and O
told O
her O
all. O
She O
excused O
him, O
threw O
the O
blame O
of O
his O
failure O
on O
the O
injustice O
of O
the O
examiners, O
encouraged O
him O
a O
little, O
and O
took O
upon O
herself O
to O
set O
matters O
straight. O
It O
was O
only O
five O
years O
later O
that O
Monsieur O
Bovary O
knew O
the O
truth; O
it O
was O
old O
then, O
and O
he O
accepted O
it. O
Moreover, O
he O
could O
not O
believe O
that O
a O
man O
born O
of O
him O
could O
be O
a O
fool. O
So O
Charles O
set O
to O
work O
again O
and O
crammed O
for O
his O
examination, O
ceaselessly O
learning O
all O
the O
old O
questions O
by O
heart. O
He O
passed O
pretty O
well. O
What O
a O
happy O
day O
for O
his O
mother! O
They O
gave O
a O
grand O
dinner. O
Where O
should O
he O
go O
to O
practice? O
To O
Tostes, O
where O
there O
was O
only O
one O
old O
doctor. O
For O
a O
long O
time O
Madame O
Bovary O
had O
been O
on O
the O
look-out O
for O
his O
death, O
and O
the O
old O
fellow O
had O
barely O
been O
packed O
off O
when O
Charles O
was O
installed, O
opposite O
his O
place, O
as O
his O
successor. O
But O
it O
was O
not O
everything O
to O
have O
brought O
up O
a O
son, O
to O
have O
had O
him O
taught O
medicine, O
and O
discovered O
Tostes, O
where O
he O
could O
practice O
it; O
he O
must O
have O
a O
wife. O
She O
found O
him O
one-- O
the O
widow O
of O
a O
bailiff O
at O
Dieppe-- O
who O
was O
forty-five O
and O
had O
an O
income O
of O
twelve O
hundred O
francs. O
Though O
she O
was O
ugly, O
as O
dry O
as O
a O
bone, O
her O
face O
with O
as O
many O
pimples O
as O
the O
spring O
has O
buds, O
Madame O
Dubuc O
had O
no O
lack O
of O
suitors. O
To O
attain O
her O
ends O
Madame O
Bovary O
had O
to O
oust O
them O
all, O
and O
she O
even O
succeeded O
in O
very O
cleverly O
baffling O
the O
intrigues O
of O
a O
port-butcher O
backed O
up O
by O
the O
priests. O
Charles O
had O
seen O
in O
marriage O
the O
advent O
of O
an O
easier O
life, O
thinking O
he O
would O
be O
more O
free O
to O
do O
as O
he O
liked O
with O
himself O
and O
his O
money. O
But O
his O
wife O
was O
master; O
he O
had O
to O
say O
this O
and O
not O
say O
that O
in O
company, O
to O
fast O
every O
Friday, O
dress O
as O
she O
liked, O
harass O
at O
her O
bidding O
those O
patients O
who O
did O
not O
pay. O
She O
opened O
his O
letter, O
watched O
his O
comings O
and O
goings, O
and O
listened O
at O
the O
partition-wall O
when O
women O
came O
to O
consult O
him O
in O
his O
surgery. O
She O
must O
have O
her O
chocolate O
every O
morning, O
attentions O
without O
end. O
She O
constantly O
complained O
of O
her O
nerves, O
her O
chest, O
her O
liver. O
The O
noise O
of O
footsteps O
made O
her O
ill; O
when O
people O
left O
her, O
solitude O
became O
odious O
to O
her; O
if O
they O
came O
back, O
it O
was O
doubtless O
to O
see O
her O
die. O
When O
Charles O
returned O
in O
the O
evening, O
she O
stretched O
forth O
two O
long O
thin O
arms O
from O
beneath O
the O
sheets, O
put O
them O
round O
his O
neck, O
and O
having O
made O
him O
sit O
down O
on O
the O
edge O
of O
the O
bed, O
began O
to O
talk O
to O
him O
of O
her O
troubles: O
he O
was O
neglecting O
her, O
he O
loved O
another. O
She O
had O
been O
warned O
she O
would O
be O
unhappy; O
and O
she O
ended O
by O
asking O
him O
for O
a O
dose O
of O
medicine O
and O
a O
little O
more O
love. O
CHAPTER O
TWO O
One O
night O
towards O
eleven O
o'clock O
they O
were O
awakened O
by O
the O
noise O
of O
a O
horse O
pulling O
up O
outside O
their O
door. O
The O
servant O
opened O
the O
garret-window O
and O
parleyed O
for O
some O
time O
with O
a O
man O
in O
the O
street O
below. O
He O
came O
for O
the O
doctor, O
had O
a O
letter O
for O
him. O
Natasie O
came O
downstairs O
shivering O
and O
undid O
the O
bars O
and O
bolts O
one O
after O
the O
other. O
The O
man O
left O
his O
horse, O
and, O
following O
the O
servant, O
suddenly O
came O
in O
behind O
her. O
He O
pulled O
out O
from O
his O
wool O
cap O
with O
grey O
top-knots O
a O
letter O
wrapped O
up O
in O
a O
rag O
and O
presented O
it O
gingerly O
to O
Charles, O
who O
rested O
on O
his O
elbow O
on O
the O
pillow O
to O
read O
it. O
Natasie, O
standing O
near O
the O
bed, O
held O
the O
light. O
Madame O
in O
modesty O
had O
turned O
to O
the O
wall O
and O
showed O
only O
her O
back. O
This O
letter, O
sealed O
with O
a O
small O
seal O
in O
blue O
wax, O
begged O
Monsieur O
Bovary O
to O
come O
immediately O
to O
the O
farm O
of O
the O
Bertaux O
to O
set O
a O
broken O
leg. O
Now O
from O
Tostes O
to O
the O
Bertaux O
was O
a O
good O
eighteen O
miles O
across O
country O
by O
way O
of O
Longueville O
and O
Saint-Victor. O
It O
was O
a O
dark O
night; O
Madame O
Bovary O
junior O
was O
afraid O
of O
accidents O
for O
her O
husband. O
So O
it O
was O
decided O
the O
stable-boy O
should O
go O
on O
first; O
Charles O
would O
start O
three O
hours O
later O
when O
the O
moon O
rose. O
A O
boy O
was O
to O
be O
sent O
to O
meet O
him, O
and O
show O
him O
the O
way O
to O
the O
farm, O
and O
open O
the O
gates O
for O
him. O
Towards O
four O
o'clock O
in O
the O
morning, O
Charles, O
well O
wrapped O
up O
in O
his O
cloak, O
set O
out O
for O
the O
Bertaux. O
Still O
sleepy O
from O
the O
warmth O
of O
his O
bed, O
he O
let O
himself O
be O
lulled O
by O
the O
quiet O
trot O
of O
his O
horse. O
When O
it O
stopped O
of O
its O
own O
accord O
in O
front O
of O
those O
holes O
surrounded O
with O
thorns O
that O
are O
dug O
on O
the O
margin O
of O
furrows, O
Charles O
awoke O
with O
a O
start, O
suddenly O
remembered O
the O
broken O
leg, O
and O
tried O
to O
call O
to O
mind O
all O
the O
fractures O
he O
knew. O
The O
rain O
had O
stopped, O
day O
was O
breaking, O
and O
on O
the O
branches O
of O
the O
leafless O
trees O
birds O
roosted O
motionless, O
their O
little O
feathers O
bristling O
in O
the O
cold O
morning O
wind. O
The O
flat O
country O
stretched O
as O
far O
as O
eye O
could O
see, O
and O
the O
tufts O
of O
trees O
round O
the O
farms O
at O
long O
intervals O
seemed O
like O
dark O
violet O
stains O
on O
the O
cast O
grey O
surface, O
that O
on O
the O
horizon O
faded O
into O
the O
gloom O
of O
the O
sky. O
Charles O
from O
time O
to O
time O
opened O
his O
eyes, O
his O
mind O
grew O
weary, O
and, O
sleep O
coming O
upon O
him, O
he O
soon O
fell O
into O
a O
doze O
wherein, O
his O
recent O
sensations O
blending O
with O
memories, O
he O
became O
conscious O
of O
a O
double O
self, O
at O
once O
student O
and O
married O
man, O
lying O
in O
his O
bed O
as O
but O
now, O
and O
crossing O
the O
operation O
theatre O
as O
of O
old. O
The O
warm O
smell O
of O
poultices O
mingled O
in O
his O
brain O
with O
the O
fresh O
odour O
of O
dew; O
he O
heard O
the O
iron O
rings O
rattling O
along O
the O
curtain-rods O
of O
the O
bed O
and O
saw O
his O
wife O
sleeping. O
As O
he O
passed O
Vassonville O
he O
came O
upon O
a O
boy O
sitting O
on O
the O
grass O
at O
the O
edge O
of O
a O
ditch. O
"Are O
you O
the O
doctor?" O
asked O
the O
child. O
And O
on O
Charles's O
answer O
he O
took O
his O
wooden O
shoes O
in O
his O
hands O
and O
ran O
on O
in O
front O
of O
him. O
The O
general O
practitioner, O
riding O
along, O
gathered O
from O
his O
guide's O
talk O
that O
Monsieur O
Rouault O
must O
be O
one O
of O
the O
well-to-do O
farmers. O
He O
had O
broken O
his O
leg O
the O
evening O
before O
on O
his O
way O
home O
from O
a O
Twelfth-night O
feast O
at O
a O
neighbour's. O
His O
wife O
had O
been O
dead O
for O
two O
years. O
There O
was O
with O
him O
only O
his O
daughter, O
who O
helped O
him O
to O
keep O
house. O
The O
ruts O
were O
becoming O
deeper; O
they O
were O
approaching O
the O
Bertaux. O
The O
little O
lad, O
slipping O
through O
a O
hole O
in O
the O
hedge, O
disappeared; O
then O
he O
came O
back O
to O
the O
end O
of O
a O
courtyard O
to O
open O
the O
gate. O
The O
horse O
slipped O
on O
the O
wet O
grass; O
Charles O
had O
to O
stoop O
to O
pass O
under O
the O
branches. O
The O
watchdogs O
in O
their O
kennels O
barked, O
dragging O
at O
their O
chains. O
As O
he O
entered O
the O
Bertaux, O
the O
horse O
took O
fright O
and O
stumbled. O
It O
was O
a O
substantial-looking O
farm. O
In O
the O
stables, O
over O
the O
top O
of O
the O
open O
doors, O
one O
could O
see O
great O
cart-horses O
quietly O
feeding O
from O
new O
racks. O
Right O
along O
the O
outbuildings O
extended O
a O
large O
dunghill, O
from O
which O
manure O
liquid O
oozed, O
while O
amidst O
fowls O
and O
turkeys, O
five O
or O
six O
peacocks, O
a O
luxury O
in O
Chauchois O
farmyards, O
were O
foraging O
on O
the O
top O
of O
it. O
The O
sheepfold O
was O
long, O
the O
barn O
high, O
with O
walls O
smooth O
as O
your O
hand. O
Under O
the O
cart-shed O
were O
two O
large O
carts O
and O
four O
ploughs, O
with O
their O
whips, O
shafts O
and O
harnesses O
complete, O
whose O
fleeces O
of O
blue O
wool O
were O
getting O
soiled O
by O
the O
fine O
dust O
that O
fell O
from O
the O
granaries. O
The O
courtyard O
sloped O
upwards, O
planted O
with O
trees O
set O
out O
symmetrically, O
and O
the O
chattering O
noise O
of O
a O
flock O
of O
geese O
was O
heard O
near O
the O
pond. O
A O
young O
woman O
in O
a O
blue O
merino O
dress O
with O
three O
flounces O
came O
to O
the O
threshold O
of O
the O
door O
to O
receive O
Monsieur O
Bovary, O
whom O
she O
led O
to O
the O
kitchen, O
where O
a O
large O
fire O
was O
blazing. O
The O
servant's O
breakfast O
was O
boiling O
beside O
it O
in O
small O
pots O
of O
all O
sizes. O
Some O
damp O
clothes O
were O
drying O
inside O
the O
chimney-corner. O
The O
shovel, O
tongs, O
and O
the O
nozzle O
of O
the O
bellows, O
all O
of O
colossal O
size, O
shone O
like O
polished O
steel, O
while O
along O
the O
walls O
hung O
many O
pots O
and O
pans O
in O
which O
the O
clear O
flame O
of O
the O
hearth, O
mingling O
with O
the O
first O
rays O
of O
the O
sun O
coming O
in O
through O
the O
window, O
was O
mirrored O
fitfully. O
Charles O
went O
up O
the O
first O
floor O
to O
see O
the O
patient. O
He O
found O
him O
in O
his O
bed, O
sweating O
under O
his O
bed-clothes, O
having O
thrown O
his O
cotton O
nightcap O
right O
away O
from O
him. O
He O
was O
a O
fat O
little O
man O
of O
fifty, O
with O
white O
skin O
and O
blue O
eyes, O
the O
forepart O
of O
his O
head O
bald, O
and O
he O
wore O
earrings. O
By O
his O
side O
on O
a O
chair O
stood O
a O
large O
decanter O
of O
brandy, O
whence O
he O
poured O
himself O
a O
little O
from O
time O
to O
time O
to O
keep O
up O
his O
spirits; O
but O
as O
soon O
as O
he O
caught O
sight O
of O
the O
doctor O
his O
elation O
subsided, O
and O
instead O
of O
swearing, O
as O
he O
had O
been O
doing O
for O
the O
last O
twelve O
hours, O
began O
to O
groan O
freely. O
The O
fracture O
was O
a O
simple O
one, O
without O
any O
kind O
of O
complication. O
Charles O
could O
not O
have O
hoped O
for O
an O
easier O
case. O
Then O
calling O
to O
mind O
the O
devices O
of O
his O
masters O
at O
the O
bedsides O
of O
patients, O
he O
comforted O
the O
sufferer O
with O
all O
sorts O
of O
kindly O
remarks, O
those O
Caresses O
of O
the O
surgeon O
that O
are O
like O
the O
oil O
they O
put O
on O
bistouries. O
In O
order O
to O
make O
some O
splints O
a O
bundle O
of O
laths O
was O
brought O
up O
from O
the O
cart-house. O
Charles O
selected O
one, O
cut O
it O
into O
two O
pieces O
and O
planed O
it O
with O
a O
fragment O
of O
windowpane, O
while O
the O
servant O
tore O
up O
sheets O
to O
make O
bandages, O
and O
Mademoiselle O
Emma O
tried O
to O
sew O
some O
pads. O
As O
she O
was O
a O
long O
time O
before O
she O
found O
her O
work-case, O
her O
father O
grew O
impatient; O
she O
did O
not O
answer, O
but O
as O
she O
sewed O
she O
pricked O
her O
fingers, O
which O
she O
then O
put O
to O
her O
mouth O
to O
suck O
them. O
Charles O
was O
surprised O
at O
the O
whiteness O
of O
her O
nails. O
They O
were O
shiny, O
delicate O
at O
the O
tips, O
more O
polished O
than O
the O
ivory O
of O
Dieppe, O
and O
almond-shaped. O
Yet O
her O
hand O
was O
not O
beautiful, O
perhaps O
not O
white O
enough, O
and O
a O
little O
hard O
at O
the O
knuckles; O
besides, O
it O
was O
too O
long, O
with O
no O
soft O
inflections O
in O
the O
outlines. O
Her O
real O
beauty O
was O
in O
her O
eyes. O
Although O
brown, O
they O
seemed O
black O
because O
of O
the O
lashes, O
and O
her O
look O
came O
at O
you O
frankly, O
with O
a O
candid O
boldness. O
The O
bandaging O
over, O
the O
doctor O
was O
invited O
by O
Monsieur O
Rouault O
himself O
to O
"pick O
a O
bit" O
before O
he O
left. O
Charles O
went O
down O
into O
the O
room O
on O
the O
ground O
floor. O
Knives O
and O
forks O
and O
silver O
goblets O
were O
laid O
for O
two O
on O
a O
little O
table O
at O
the O
foot O
of O
a O
huge O
bed O
that O
had O
a O
canopy O
of O
printed O
cotton O
with O
figures O
representing O
Turks. O
There O
was O
an O
odour O
of O
iris-root O
and O
damp O
sheets O
that O
escaped O
from O
a O
large O
oak O
chest O
opposite O
the O
window. O
On O
the O
floor O
in O
corners O
were O
sacks O
of O
flour O
stuck O
upright O
in O
rows. O
These O
were O
the O
overflow O
from O
the O
neighbouring O
granary, O
to O
which O
three O
stone O
steps O
led. O
By O
way O
of O
decoration O
for O
the O
apartment, O
hanging O
to O
a O
nail O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
wall, O
whose O
green O
paint O
scaled O
off O
from O
the O
effects O
of O
the O
saltpetre, O
was O
a O
crayon O
head O
of O
Minerva O
in O
gold O
frame, O
underneath O
which O
was O
written O
in O
Gothic O
letters O
"To O
dear O
Papa." O
First O
they O
spoke O
of O
the O
patient, O
then O
of O
the O
weather, O
of O
the O
great O
cold, O
of O
the O
wolves O
that O
infested O
the O
fields O
at O
night. O
Mademoiselle O
Rouault O
did O
not O
at O
all O
like O
the O
country, O
especially O
now O
that O
she O
had O
to O
look O
after O
the O
farm O
almost O
alone. O
As O
the O
room O
was O
chilly, O
she O
shivered O
as O
she O
ate. O
This O
showed O
something O
of O
her O
full O
lips, O
that O
she O
had O
a O
habit O
of O
biting O
when O
silent. O
Her O
neck O
stood O
out O
from O
a O
white O
turned-down O
collar. O
Her O
hair, O
whose O
two O
black O
folds O
seemed O
each O
of O
a O
single O
piece, O
so O
smooth O
were O
they, O
was O
parted O
in O
the O
middle O
by O
a O
delicate O
line O
that O
curved O
slightly O
with O
the O
curve O
of O
the O
head; O
and, O
just O
showing O
the O
tip O
of O
the O
ear, O
it O
was O
joined O
behind O
in O
a O
thick O
chignon, O
with O
a O
wavy O
movement O
at O
the O
temples O
that O
the O
country O
doctor O
saw O
now O
for O
the O
first O
time O
in O
his O
life. O
The O
upper O
part O
of O
her O
cheek O
was O
rose-coloured. O
She O
had, O
like O
a O
man, O
thrust O
in O
between O
two O
buttons O
of O
her O
bodice O
a O
tortoise-shell O
eyeglass. O
When O
Charles, O
after O
bidding O
farewell O
to O
old O
Rouault, O
returned O
to O
the O
room O
before O
leaving, O
he O
found O
her O
standing, O
her O
forehead O
against O
the O
window, O
looking O
into O
the O
garden, O
where O
the O
bean O
props O
had O
been O
knocked O
down O
by O
the O
wind. O
She O
turned O
round. O
"Are O
you O
looking O
for O
anything?" O
she O
asked. O
"My O
whip, O
if O
you O
please," O
he O
answered. O
He O
began O
rummaging O
on O
the O
bed, O
behind O
the O
doors, O
under O
the O
chairs. O
It O
had O
fallen O
to O
the O
floor, O
between O
the O
sacks O
and O
the O
wall. O
Mademoiselle O
Emma O
saw O
it, O
and O
bent O
over O
the O
flour O
sacks. O
Charles O
out O
of O
politeness O
made O
a O
dash O
also, O
and O
as O
he O
stretched O
out O
his O
arm, O
at O
the O
same O
moment O
felt O
his O
breast O
brush O
against O
the O
back O
of O
the O
young O
girl O
bending O
beneath O
him. O
She O
drew O
herself O
up, O
scarlet, O
and O
looked O
at O
him O
over O
her O
shoulder O
as O
she O
handed O
him O
his O
whip. O
Instead O
of O
returning O
to O
the O
Bertaux O
in O
three O
days O
as O
he O
had O
promised, O
he O
went O
back O
the O
very O
next O
day, O
then O
regularly O
twice O
a O
week, O
without O
counting O
the O
visits O
he O
paid O
now O
and O
then O
as O
if O
by O
accident. O
Everything, O
moreover, O
went O
well; O
the O
patient O
progressed O
favourably; O
and O
when, O
at O
the O
end O
of O
forty-six O
days, O
old O
Rouault O
was O
seen O
trying O
to O
walk O
alone O
in O
his O
"den," O
Monsieur O
Bovary O
began O
to O
be O
looked O
upon O
as O
a O
man O
of O
great O
capacity. O
Old O
Rouault O
said O
that O
he O
could O
not O
have O
been O
cured O
better O
by O
the O
first O
doctor O
of O
Yvetot, O
or O
even O
of O
Rouen. O
As O
to O
Charles, O
he O
did O
not O
stop O
to O
ask O
himself O
why O
it O
was O
a O
pleasure O
to O
him O
to O
go O
to O
the O
Bertaux. O
Had O
he O
done O
so, O
he O
would, O
no O
doubt, O
have O
attributed O
his O
zeal O
to O
the O
importance O
of O
the O
case, O
or O
perhaps O
to O
the O
money O
he O
hoped O
to O
make O
by O
it. O
Was O
it O
for O
this, O
however, O
that O
his O
visits O
to O
the O
farm O
formed O
a O
delightful O
exception O
to O
the O
meagre O
occupations O
of O
his O
life? O
On O
these O
days O
he O
rose O
early, O
set O
off O
at O
a O
gallop, O
urging O
on O
his O
horse, O
then O
got O
down O
to O
wipe O
his O
boots O
in O
the O
grass O
and O
put O
on O
black O
gloves O
before O
entering. O
He O
liked O
going O
into O
the O
courtyard, O
and O
noticing O
the O
gate O
turn O
against O
his O
shoulder, O
the O
cock O
crow O
on O
the O
wall, O
the O
lads O
run O
to O
meet O
him. O
He O
liked O
the O
granary O
and O
the O
stables; O
he O
liked O
old O
Rouault, O
who O
pressed O
his O
hand O
and O
called O
him O
his O
saviour; O
he O
like O
the O
small O
wooden O
shoes O
of O
Mademoiselle O
Emma O
on O
the O
scoured O
flags O
of O
the O
kitchen-- O
her O
high O
heels O
made O
her O
a O
little O
taller; O
and O
when O
she O
walked O
in O
front O
of O
him, O
the O
wooden O
soles O
springing O
up O
quickly O
struck O
with O
a O
sharp O
sound O
against O
the O
leather O
of O
her O
boots. O
She O
always O
accompanied O
him O
to O
the O
first O
step O
of O
the O
stairs. O
When O
his O
horse O
had O
not O
yet O
been O
brought O
round O
she O
stayed O
there. O
They O
had O
said O
"Good-bye"; O
there O
was O
no O
more O
talking. O
The O
open O
air O
wrapped O
her O
round, O
playing O
with O
the O
soft O
down O
on O
the O
back O
of O
her O
neck, O
or O
blew O
to O
and O
fro O
on O
her O
hips O
the O
apron-strings, O
that O
fluttered O
like O
streamers. O
Once, O
during O
a O
thaw O
the O
bark O
of O
the O
trees O
in O
the O
yard O
was O
oozing, O
the O
snow O
on O
the O
roofs O
of O
the O
outbuildings O
was O
melting; O
she O
stood O
on O
the O
threshold, O
and O
went O
to O
fetch O
her O
sunshade O
and O
opened O
it. O
The O
sunshade O
of O
silk O
of O
the O
colour O
of O
pigeons' O
breasts, O
through O
which O
the O
sun O
shone, O
lighted O
up O
with O
shifting O
hues O
the O
white O
skin O
of O
her O
face. O
She O
smiled O
under O
the O
tender O
warmth, O
and O
drops O
of O
water O
could O
be O
heard O
falling O
one O
by O
one O
on O
the O
stretched O
silk. O
During O
the O
first O
period O
of O
Charles's O
visits O
to O
the O
Bertaux, O
Madame O
Bovary O
junior O
never O
failed O
to O
inquire O
after O
the O
invalid, O
and O
she O
had O
even O
chosen O
in O
the O
book O
that O
she O
kept O
on O
a O
system O
of O
double O
entry O
a O
clean O
blank O
page O
for O
Monsieur O
Rouault. O
But O
when O
she O
heard O
he O
had O
a O
daughter, O
she O
began O
to O
make O
inquiries, O
and O
she O
learnt O
the O
Mademoiselle O
Rouault, O
brought O
up O
at O
the O
Ursuline O
Convent, O
had O
received O
what O
is O
called O
"a O
good O
education"; O
and O
so O
knew O
dancing, O
geography, O
drawing, O
how O
to O
embroider O
and O
play O
the O
piano. O
That O
was O
the O
last O
straw. O
"So O
it O
is O
for O
this," O
she O
said O
to O
herself, O
"that O
his O
face O
beams O
when O
he O
goes O
to O
see O
her, O
and O
that O
he O
puts O
on O
his O
new O
waistcoat O
at O
the O
risk O
of O
spoiling O
it O
with O
the O
rain. O
Ah! O
that O
woman! O
That O
woman!" O
And O
she O
detested O
her O
instinctively. O
At O
first O
she O
solaced O
herself O
by O
allusions O
that O
Charles O
did O
not O
understand, O
then O
by O
casual O
observations O
that O
he O
let O
pass O
for O
fear O
of O
a O
storm, O
finally O
by O
open O
apostrophes O
to O
which O
he O
knew O
not O
what O
to O
answer. O
"Why O
did O
he O
go O
back O
to O
the O
Bertaux O
now O
that O
Monsieur O
Rouault O
was O
cured O
and O
that O
these O
folks O
hadn't O
paid O
yet? O
Ah! O
it O
was O
because O
a O
young O
lady O
was O
there, O
some O
one O
who O
know O
how O
to O
talk, O
to O
embroider, O
to O
be O
witty. O
That O
was O
what O
he O
cared O
about; O
he O
wanted O
town O
misses." O
And O
she O
went O
on-- O
"The O
daughter O
of O
old O
Rouault O
a O
town O
miss! O
Get O
out! O
Their O
grandfather O
was O
a O
shepherd, O
and O
they O
have O
a O
cousin O
who O
was O
almost O
had O
up O
at O
the O
assizes O
for O
a O
nasty O
blow O
in O
a O
quarrel. O
It O
is O
not O
worth O
while O
making O
such O
a O
fuss, O
or O
showing O
herself O
at O
church O
on O
Sundays O
in O
a O
silk O
gown O
like O
a O
countess. O
Besides, O
the O
poor O
old O
chap, O
if O
it O
hadn't O
been O
for O
the O
colza O
last O
year, O
would O
have O
had O
much O
ado O
to O
pay O
up O
his O
arrears." O
For O
very O
weariness O
Charles O
left O
off O
going O
to O
the O
Bertaux. O
Heloise O
made O
him O
swear, O
his O
hand O
on O
the O
prayer-book, O
that O
he O
would O
go O
there O
no O
more O
after O
much O
sobbing O
and O
many O
kisses, O
in O
a O
great O
outburst O
of O
love. O
He O
obeyed O
then, O
but O
the O
strength O
of O
his O
desire O
protested O
against O
the O
servility O
of O
his O
conduct; O
and O
he O
thought, O
with O
a O
kind O
of O
naive O
hypocrisy, O
that O
his O
interdict O
to O
see O
her O
gave O
him O
a O
sort O
of O
right O
to O
love O
her. O
And O
then O
the O
widow O
was O
thin; O
she O
had O
long O
teeth; O
wore O
in O
all O
weathers O
a O
little O
black O
shawl, O
the O
edge O
of O
which O
hung O
down O
between O
her O
shoulder-blades; O
her O
bony O
figure O
was O
sheathed O
in O
her O
clothes O
as O
if O
they O
were O
a O
scabbard; O
they O
were O
too O
short, O
and O
displayed O
her O
ankles O
with O
the O
laces O
of O
her O
large O
boots O
crossed O
over O
grey O
stockings. O
Charles's O
mother O
came O
to O
see O
them O
from O
time O
to O
time, O
but O
after O
a O
few O
days O
the O
daughter-in-law O
seemed O
to O
put O
her O
own O
edge O
on O
her, O
and O
then, O
like O
two O
knives, O
they O
scarified O
him O
with O
their O
reflections O
and O
observations. O
It O
was O
wrong O
of O
him O
to O
eat O
so O
much. O
Why O
did O
he O
always O
offer O
a O
glass O
of O
something O
to O
everyone O
who O
came? O
What O
obstinacy O
not O
to O
wear O
flannels! O
In O
the O
spring O
it O
came O
about O
that O
a O
notary O
at O
Ingouville, O
the O
holder O
of O
the O
widow O
Dubuc's O
property, O
one O
fine O
day O
went O
off, O
taking O
with O
him O
all O
the O
money O
in O
his O
office. O
Heloise, O
it O
is O
true, O
still O
possessed, O
besides O
a O
share O
in O
a O
boat O
valued O
at O
six O
thousand O
francs, O
her O
house O
in O
the O
Rue O
St. O
Francois; O
and O
yet, O
with O
all O
this O
fortune O
that O
had O
been O
so O
trumpeted O
abroad, O
nothing, O
excepting O
perhaps O
a O
little O
furniture O
and O
a O
few O
clothes, O
had O
appeared O
in O
the O
household. O
The O
matter O
had O
to O
be O
gone O
into. O
The O
house O
at O
Dieppe O
was O
found O
to O
be O
eaten O
up O
with O
mortgages O
to O
its O
foundations; O
what O
she O
had O
placed O
with O
the O
notary O
God O
only O
knew, O
and O
her O
share O
in O
the O
boat O
did O
not O
exceed O
one O
thousand O
crowns. O
She O
had O
lied, O
the O
good O
lady! O
In O
his O
exasperation, O
Monsieur O
Bovary O
the O
elder, O
smashing O
a O
chair O
on O
the O
flags, O
accused O
his O
wife O
of O
having O
caused O
misfortune O
to O
the O
son O
by O
harnessing O
him O
to O
such O
a O
harridan, O
whose O
harness O
wasn't O
worth O
her O
hide. O
They O
came O
to O
Tostes. O
Explanations O
followed. O
There O
were O
scenes. O
Heloise O
in O
tears, O
throwing O
her O
arms O
about O
her O
husband, O
implored O
him O
to O
defend O
her O
from O
his O
parents. O
Charles O
tried O
to O
speak O
up O
for O
her. O
They O
grew O
angry O
and O
left O
the O
house. O
But O
"the O
blow O
had O
struck O
home." O
A O
week O
after, O
as O
she O
was O
hanging O
up O
some O
washing O
in O
her O
yard, O
she O
was O
seized O
with O
a O
spitting O
of O
blood, O
and O
the O
next O
day, O
while O
Charles O
had O
his O
back O
turned O
to O
her O
drawing O
the O
window-curtain, O
she O
said, O
"O O
God!" O
gave O
a O
sigh O
and O
fainted. O
She O
was O
dead! O
What O
a O
surprise! O
When O
all O
was O
over O
at O
the O
cemetery O
Charles O
went O
home. O
He O
found O
no O
one O
downstairs; O
he O
went O
up O
to O
the O
first O
floor O
to O
their O
room; O
say O
her O
dress O
still O
hanging O
at O
the O
foot O
of O
the O
alcove; O
then, O
leaning O
against O
the O
writing-table, O
he O
stayed O
until O
the O
evening, O
buried O
in O
a O
sorrowful O
reverie. O
She O
had O
loved O
him O
after O
all! O
CHAPTER O
THREE O
One O
morning O
old O
Rouault O
brought O
Charles O
the O
money O
for O
setting O
his O
leg-- O
seventy-five O
francs O
in O
forty-sou O
pieces, O
and O
a O
turkey. O
He O
had O
heard O
of O
his O
loss, O
and O
consoled O
him O
as O
well O
as O
he O
could. O
"I O
know O
what O
it O
is," O
said O
he, O
clapping O
him O
on O
the O
shoulder; O
"I've O
been O
through O
it. O
When O
I O
lost O
my O
dear O
departed, O
I O
went O
into O
the O
fields O
to O
be O
quite O
alone. O
I O
fell O
at O
the O
foot O
of O
a O
tree; O
I O
cried; O
I O
called O
on O
God; O
I O
talked O
nonsense O
to O
Him. O
I O
wanted O
to O
be O
like O
the O
moles O
that O
I O
saw O
on O
the O
branches, O
their O
insides O
swarming O
with O
worms, O
dead, O
and O
an O
end O
of O
it. O
And O
when O
I O
thought O
that O
there O
were O
others O
at O
that O
very O
moment O
with O
their O
nice O
little O
wives O
holding O
them O
in O
their O
embrace, O
I O
struck O
great O
blows O
on O
the O
earth O
with O
my O
stick. O
I O
was O
pretty O
well O
mad O
with O
not O
eating; O
the O
very O
idea O
of O
going O
to O
a O
cafe O
disgusted O
me-- O
you O
wouldn't O
believe O
it. O
Well, O
quite O
softly, O
one O
day O
following O
another, O
a O
spring O
on O
a O
winter, O
and O
an O
autumn O
after O
a O
summer, O
this O
wore O
away, O
piece O
by O
piece, O
crumb O
by O
crumb; O
it O
passed O
away, O
it O
is O
gone, O
I O
should O
say O
it O
has O
sunk; O
for O
something O
always O
remains O
at O
the O
bottom O
as O
one O
would O
say O
-- O
a O
weight O
here, O
at O
one's O
heart. O
But O
since O
it O
is O
the O
lot O
of O
all O
of O
us, O
one O
must O
not O
give O
way O
altogether, O
and, O
because O
others O
have O
died, O
want O
to O
die O
too. O
You O
must O
pull O
yourself O
together, O
Monsieur O
Bovary. O
It O
will O
pass O
away. O
Come O
to O
see O
us; O
my O
daughter O
thinks O
of O
you O
now O
and O
again, O
d'ye O
know, O
and O
she O
says O
you O
are O
forgetting O
her. O
Spring O
will O
soon O
be O
here. O
We'll O
have O
some O
rabbit-shooting O
in O
the O
warrens O
to O
amuse O
you O
a O
bit." O
Charles O
followed O
his O
advice. O
He O
went O
back O
to O
the O
Bertaux. O
He O
found O
all O
as O
he O
had O
left O
it, O
that O
is O
to O
say, O
as O
it O
was O
five O
months O
ago. O
The O
pear O
trees O
were O
already O
in O
blossom, O
and O
Farmer O
Rouault, O
on O
his O
legs O
again, O
came O
and O
went, O
making O
the O
farm O
more O
full O
of O
life. O
Thinking O
it O
his O
duty O
to O
heap O
the O
greatest O
attention O
upon O
the O
doctor O
because O
of O
his O
sad O
position, O
he O
begged O
him O
not O
to O
take O
his O
hat O
off, O
spoke O
to O
him O
in O
an O
undertone O
as O
if O
he O
had O
been O
ill, O
and O
even O
pretended O
to O
be O
angry O
because O
nothing O
rather O
lighter O
had O
been O
prepared O
for O
him O
than O
for O
the O
others, O
such O
as O
a O
little O
clotted O
cream O
or O
stewed O
pears. O
He O
told O
stories. O
Charles O
found O
himself O
laughing, O
but O
the O
remembrance O
of O
his O
wife O
suddenly O
coming O
back O
to O
him O
depressed O
him. O
Coffee O
was O
brought O
in; O
he O
thought O
no O
more O
about O
her. O
He O
thought O
less O
of O
her O
as O
he O
grew O
accustomed O
to O
living O
alone. O
The O
new O
delight O
of O
independence O
soon O
made O
his O
loneliness O
bearable. O
He O
could O
now O
change O
his O
meal-times, O
go O
in O
or O
out O
without O
explanation, O
and O
when O
he O
was O
very O
tired O
stretch O
himself O
at O
full O
length O
on O
his O
bed. O
So O
he O
nursed O
and O
coddled O
himself O
and O
accepted O
the O
consolations O
that O
were O
offered O
him. O
On O
the O
other O
hand, O
the O
death O
of O
his O
wife O
had O
not O
served O
him O
ill O
in O
his O
business, O
since O
for O
a O
month O
people O
had O
been O
saying, O
"The O
poor O
young O
man! O
what O
a O
loss!" O
His O
name O
had O
been O
talked O
about, O
his O
practice O
had O
increased; O
and O
moreover, O
he O
could O
go O
to O
the O
Bertaux O
just O
as O
he O
liked. O
He O
had O
an O
aimless O
hope, O
and O
was O
vaguely O
happy; O
he O
thought O
himself O
better O
looking O
as O
he O
brushed O
his O
whiskers O
before O
the O
looking-glass. O
One O
day O
he O
got O
there O
about O
three O
o'clock. O
Everybody O
was O
in O
the O
fields. O
He O
went O
into O
the O
kitchen, O
but O
did O
not O
at O
once O
catch O
sight O
of O
Emma; O
the O
outside O
shutters O
were O
closed. O
Through O
the O
chinks O
of O
the O
wood O
the O
sun O
sent O
across O
the O
flooring O
long O
fine O
rays O
that O
were O
broken O
at O
the O
corners O
of O
the O
furniture O
and O
trembled O
along O
the O
ceiling. O
Some O
flies O
on O
the O
table O
were O
crawling O
up O
the O
glasses O
that O
had O
been O
used, O
and O
buzzing O
as O
they O
drowned O
themselves O
in O
the O
dregs O
of O
the O
cider. O
The O
daylight O
that O
came O
in O
by O
the O
chimney O
made O
velvet O
of O
the O
soot O
at O
the O
back O
of O
the O
fireplace, O
and O
touched O
with O
blue O
the O
cold O
cinders. O
Between O
the O
window O
and O
the O
hearth O
Emma O
was O
sewing; O
she O
wore O
no O
fichu; O
he O
could O
see O
small O
drops O
of O
perspiration O
on O
her O
bare O
shoulders. O
After O
the O
fashion O
of O
country O
folks O
she O
asked O
him O
to O
have O
something O
to O
drink. O
He O
said O
no; O
she O
insisted, O
and O
at O
last O
laughingly O
offered O
to O
have O
a O
glass O
of O
liqueur O
with O
him. O
So O
she O
went O
to O
fetch O
a O
bottle O
of O
curacao O
from O
the O
cupboard, O
reached O
down O
two O
small O
glasses, O
filled O
one O
to O
the O
brim, O
poured O
scarcely O
anything O
into O
the O
other, O
and, O
after O
having O
clinked O
glasses, O
carried O
hers O
to O
her O
mouth. O
As O
it O
was O
almost O
empty O
she O
bent O
back O
to O
drink, O
her O
head O
thrown O
back, O
her O
lips O
pouting, O
her O
neck O
on O
the O
strain. O
She O
laughed O
at O
getting O
none O
of O
it, O
while O
with O
the O
tip O
of O
her O
tongue O
passing O
between O
her O
small O
teeth O
she O
licked O
drop O
by O
drop O
the O
bottom O
of O
her O
glass. O
She O
sat O
down O
again O
and O
took O
up O
her O
work, O
a O
white O
cotton O
stocking O
she O
was O
darning. O
She O
worked O
with O
her O
head O
bent O
down; O
she O
did O
not O
speak, O
nor O
did O
Charles. O
The O
air O
coming O
in O
under O
the O
door O
blew O
a O
little O
dust O
over O
the O
flags; O
he O
watched O
it O
drift O
along, O
and O
heard O
nothing O
but O
the O
throbbing O
in O
his O
head O
and O
the O
faint O
clucking O
of O
a O
hen O
that O
had O
laid O
an O
egg O
in O
the O
yard. O
Emma O
from O
time O
to O
time O
cooled O
her O
cheeks O
with O
the O
palms O
of O
her O
hands, O
and O
cooled O
these O
again O
on O
the O
knobs O
of O
the O
huge O
fire-dogs. O
She O
complained O
of O
suffering O
since O
the O
beginning O
of O
the O
season O
from O
giddiness; O
she O
asked O
if O
sea-baths O
would O
do O
her O
any O
good; O
she O
began O
talking O
of O
her O
convent, O
Charles O
of O
his O
school; O
words O
came O
to O
them. O
They O
went O
up O
into O
her O
bedroom. O
She O
showed O
him O
her O
old O
music-books, O
the O
little O
prizes O
she O
had O
won, O
and O
the O
oak-leaf O
crowns, O
left O
at O
the O
bottom O
of O
a O
cupboard. O
She O
spoke O
to O
him, O
too, O
of O
her O
mother, O
of O
the O
country, O
and O
even O
showed O
him O
the O
bed O
in O
the O
garden O
where, O
on O
the O
first O
Friday O
of O
every O
month, O
she O
gathered O
flowers O
to O
put O
on O
her O
mother's O
tomb. O
But O
the O
gardener O
they O
had O
never O
knew O
anything O
about O
it; O
servants O
are O
so O
stupid! O
She O
would O
have O
dearly O
liked, O
if O
only O
for O
the O
winter, O
to O
live O
in O
town, O
although O
the O
length O
of O
the O
fine O
days O
made O
the O
country O
perhaps O
even O
more O
wearisome O
in O
the O
summer. O
And, O
according O
to O
what O
she O
was O
saying, O
her O
voice O
was O
clear, O
sharp, O
or, O
on O
a O
sudden O
all O
languor, O
drawn O
out O
in O
modulations O
that O
ended O
almost O
in O
murmurs O
as O
she O
spoke O
to O
herself, O
now O
joyous, O
opening O
big O
naive O
eyes, O
then O
with O
her O
eyelids O
half O
closed, O
her O
look O
full O
of O
boredom, O
her O
thoughts O
wandering. O
Going O
home O
at O
night, O
Charles O
went O
over O
her O
words O
one O
by O
one, O
trying O
to O
recall O
them, O
to O
fill O
out O
their O
sense, O
that O
he O
might O
piece O
out O
the O
life O
she O
had O
lived O
before O
he O
knew O
her. O
But O
he O
never O
saw O
her O
in O
his O
thoughts O
other O
than O
he O
had O
seen O
her O
the O
first O
time, O
or O
as O
he O
had O
just O
left O
her. O
Then O
he O
asked O
himself O
what O
would O
become O
of O
her-- O
if O
she O
would O
be O
married, O
and O
to O
whom! O
Alas! O
Old O
Rouault O
was O
rich, O
and O
she!-- O
so O
beautiful! O
But O
Emma's O
face O
always O
rose O
before O
his O
eyes, O
and O
a O
monotone, O
like O
the O
humming O
of O
a O
top, O
sounded O
in O
his O
ears, O
"If O
you O
should O
marry O
after O
all! O
If O
you O
should O
marry!" O
At O
night O
he O
could O
not O
sleep; O
his O
throat O
was O
parched; O
he O
was O
athirst. O
He O
got O
up O
to O
drink O
from O
the O
water-bottle O
and O
opened O
the O
window. O
The O
night O
was O
covered O
with O
stars, O
a O
warm O
wind O
blowing O
in O
the O
distance; O
the O
dogs O
were O
barking. O
He O
turned O
his O
head O
towards O
the O
Bertaux. O
Thinking O
that, O
after O
all, O
he O
should O
lose O
nothing, O
Charles O
promised O
himself O
to O
ask O
her O
in O
marriage O
as O
soon O
as O
occasion O
offered, O
but O
each O
time O
such O
occasion O
did O
offer O
the O
fear O
of O
not O
finding O
the O
right O
words O
sealed O
his O
lips. O
Old O
Rouault O
would O
not O
have O
been O
sorry O
to O
be O
rid O
of O
his O
daughter, O
who O
was O
of O
no O
use O
to O
him O
in O
the O
house. O
In O
his O
heart O
he O
excused O
her, O
thinking O
her O
too O
clever O
for O
farming, O
a O
calling O
under O
the O
ban O
of O
Heaven, O
since O
one O
never O
saw O
a O
millionaire O
in O
it. O
Far O
from O
having O
made O
a O
fortune O
by O
it, O
the O
good O
man O
was O
losing O
every O
year; O
for O
if O
he O
was O
good O
in O
bargaining, O
in O
which O
he O
enjoyed O
the O
dodges O
of O
the O
trade, O
on O
the O
other O
hand, O
agriculture O
properly O
so O
called, O
and O
the O
internal O
management O
of O
the O
farm, O
suited O
him O
less O
than O
most O
people. O
He O
did O
not O
willingly O
take O
his O
hands O
out O
of O
his O
pockets, O
and O
did O
not O
spare O
expense O
in O
all O
that O
concerned O
himself, O
liking O
to O
eat O
well, O
to O
have O
good O
fires, O
and O
to O
sleep O
well. O
He O
liked O
old O
cider, O
underdone O
legs O
of O
mutton, O
glorias O
well O
beaten O
up. O
He O
took O
his O
meals O
in O
the O
kitchen O
alone, O
opposite O
the O
fire, O
on O
a O
little O
table O
brought O
to O
him O
all O
ready O
laid O
as O
on O
the O
stage. O
A O
MIXTURE O
OF O
COFFEE O
AND O
SPIRITS. O
When, O
therefore, O
he O
perceived O
that O
Charles's O
cheeks O
grew O
red O
if O
near O
his O
daughter, O
which O
meant O
that O
he O
would O
propose O
for O
her O
one O
of O
these O
days, O
he O
chewed O
the O
cud O
of O
the O
matter O
beforehand. O
He O
certainly O
thought O
him O
a O
little O
meagre, O
and O
not O
quite O
the O
son-in-law O
he O
would O
have O
liked, O
but O
he O
was O
said O
to O
be O
well O
brought-up, O
economical, O
very O
learned, O
and O
no O
doubt O
would O
not O
make O
too O
many O
difficulties O
about O
the O
dowry. O
Now, O
as O
old O
Rouault O
would O
soon O
be O
forced O
to O
sell O
twenty-two O
acres O
of O
"his O
property," O
as O
he O
owed O
a O
good O
deal O
to O
the O
mason, O
to O
the O
harness-maker, O
and O
as O
the O
shaft O
of O
the O
cider-press O
wanted O
renewing, O
"If O
he O
asks O
for O
her," O
he O
said O
to O
himself, O
"I'll O
give O
her O
to O
him." O
At O
Michaelmas O
Charles O
went O
to O
spend O
three O
days O
at O
the O
Bertaux. O
The O
last O
had O
passed O
like O
the O
others O
in O
procrastinating O
from O
hour O
to O
hour. O
Old O
Rouault O
was O
seeing O
him O
off; O
they O
were O
walking O
along O
the O
road O
full O
of O
ruts; O
they O
were O
about O
to O
part. O
This O
was O
the O
time. O
Charles O
gave O
himself O
as O
far O
as O
to O
the O
corner O
of O
the O
hedge, O
and O
at O
last, O
when O
past O
it-- O
"Monsieur O
Rouault," O
he O
murmured, O
"I O
should O
like O
to O
say O
something O
to O
you." O
They O
stopped. O
Charles O
was O
silent. O
"Well, O
tell O
me O
your O
story. O
Don't O
I O
know O
all O
about O
it?" O
said O
old O
Rouault, O
laughing O
softly. O
"Monsieur O
Rouault-- O
Monsieur O
Rouault," O
stammered O
Charles. O
"I O
ask O
nothing O
better", O
the O
farmer O
went O
on. O
"Although, O
no O
doubt, O
the O
little O
one O
is O
of O
my O
mind, O
still O
we O
must O
ask O
her O
opinion. O
So O
you O
get O
off-- O
I'll O
go O
back O
home. O
If O
it O
is O
'yes', O
you O
needn't O
return O
because O
of O
all O
the O
people O
about, O
and O
besides O
it O
would O
upset O
her O
too O
much. O
But O
so O
that O
you O
mayn't O
be O
eating O
your O
heart, O
I'll O
open O
wide O
the O
outer O
shutter O
of O
the O
window O
against O
the O
wall; O
you O
can O
see O
it O
from O
the O
back O
by O
leaning O
over O
the O
hedge." O
And O
he O
went O
off. O
Charles O
fastened O
his O
horse O
to O
a O
tree; O
he O
ran O
into O
the O
road O
and O
waited. O
Half O
an O
hour O
passed, O
then O
he O
counted O
nineteen O
minutes O
by O
his O
watch. O
Suddenly O
a O
noise O
was O
heard O
against O
the O
wall; O
the O
shutter O
had O
been O
thrown O
back; O
the O
hook O
was O
still O
swinging. O
The O
next O
day O
by O
nine O
o'clock O
he O
was O
at O
the O
farm. O
Emma O
blushed O
as O
he O
entered, O
and O
she O
gave O
a O
little O
forced O
laugh O
to O
keep O
herself O
in O
countenance. O
Old O
Rouault O
embraced O
his O
future O
son-in-law. O
The O
discussion O
of O
money O
matters O
was O
put O
off; O
moreover, O
there O
was O
plenty O
of O
time O
before O
them, O
as O
the O
marriage O
could O
not O
decently O
take O
place O
till O
Charles O
was O
out O
of O
mourning, O
that O
is O
to O
say, O
about O
the O
spring O
of O
the O
next O
year. O
The O
winter O
passed O
waiting O
for O
this. O
Mademoiselle O
Rouault O
was O
busy O
with O
her O
trousseau. O
Part O
of O
it O
was O
ordered O
at O
Rouen, O
and O
she O
made O
herself O
chemises O
and O
nightcaps O
after O
fashion-plates O
that O
she O
borrowed. O
When O
Charles O
visited O
the O
farmer, O
the O
preparations O
for O
the O
wedding O
were O
talked O
over; O
they O
wondered O
in O
what O
room O
they O
should O
have O
dinner; O
they O
dreamed O
of O
the O
number O
of O
dishes O
that O
would O
be O
wanted, O
and O
what O
should O
be O
entrees. O
Emma O
would, O
on O
the O
contrary, O
have O
preferred O
to O
have O
a O
midnight O
wedding O
with O
torches, O
but O
old O
Rouault O
could O
not O
understand O
such O
an O
idea. O
So O
there O
was O
a O
wedding O
at O
which O
forty-three O
persons O
were O
present, O
at O
which O
they O
remained O
sixteen O
hours O
at O
table, O
began O
again O
the O
next O
day, O
and O
to O
some O
extent O
on O
the O
days O
following. O
CHAPTER O
FOUR O
The O
guests O
arrived O
early O
in O
carriages, O
in O
one-horse O
chaises, O
two-wheeled O
cars, O
old O
open O
gigs, O
waggonettes O
with O
leather O
hoods, O
and O
the O
young O
people O
from O
the O
nearer O
villages O
in O
carts, O
in O
which O
they O
stood O
up O
in O
rows, O
holding O
on O
to O
the O
sides O
so O
as O
not O
to O
fall, O
going O
at O
a O
trot O
and O
well O
shaken O
up. O
Some O
came O
from O
a O
distance O
of O
thirty O
miles, O
from O
Goderville, O
from O
Normanville, O
and O
from O
Cany. O
All O
the O
relatives O
of O
both O
families O
had O
been O
invited, O
quarrels O
between O
friends O
arranged, O
acquaintances O
long O
since O
lost O
sight O
of O
written O
to. O
From O
time O
to O
time O
one O
heard O
the O
crack O
of O
a O
whip O
behind O
the O
hedge; O
then O
the O
gates O
opened, O
a O
chaise O
entered. O
Galloping O
up O
to O
the O
foot O
of O
the O
steps, O
it O
stopped O
short O
and O
emptied O
its O
load. O
They O
got O
down O
from O
all O
sides, O
rubbing O
knees O
and O
stretching O
arms. O
The O
ladies, O
wearing O
bonnets, O
had O
on O
dresses O
in O
the O
town O
fashion, O
gold O
watch O
chains, O
pelerines O
with O
the O
ends O
tucked O
into O
belts, O
or O
little O
coloured O
fichus O
fastened O
down O
behind O
with O
a O
pin, O
and O
that O
left O
the O
back O
of O
the O
neck O
bare. O
The O
lads, O
dressed O
like O
their O
papas, O
seemed O
uncomfortable O
in O
their O
new O
clothes O
(many O
that O
day O
hand-sewed O
their O
first O
pair O
of O
boots), O
and O
by O
their O
sides, O
speaking O
never O
a O
work, O
wearing O
the O
white O
dress O
of O
their O
first O
communion O
lengthened O
for O
the O
occasion O
were O
some O
big O
girls O
of O
fourteen O
or O
sixteen, O
cousins O
or O
elder O
sisters O
no O
doubt, O
rubicund, O
bewildered, O
their O
hair O
greasy O
with O
rose O
pomade, O
and O
very O
much O
afraid O
of O
dirtying O
their O
gloves. O
As O
there O
were O
not O
enough O
stable-boys O
to O
unharness O
all O
the O
carriages, O
the O
gentlemen O
turned O
up O
their O
sleeves O
and O
set O
about O
it O
themselves. O
According O
to O
their O
different O
social O
positions O
they O
wore O
tail-coats, O
overcoats, O
shooting O
jackets, O
cutaway-coats; O
fine O
tail-coats, O
redolent O
of O
family O
respectability, O
that O
only O
came O
out O
of O
the O
wardrobe O
on O
state O
occasions; O
overcoats O
with O
long O
tails O
flapping O
in O
the O
wind O
and O
round O
capes O
and O
pockets O
like O
sacks; O
shooting O
jackets O
of O
coarse O
cloth, O
generally O
worn O
with O
a O
cap O
with O
a O
brass-bound O
peak; O
very O
short O
cutaway-coats O
with O
two O
small O
buttons O
in O
the O
back, O
close O
together O
like O
a O
pair O
of O
eyes, O
and O
the O
tails O
of O
which O
seemed O
cut O
out O
of O
one O
piece O
by O
a O
carpenter's O
hatchet. O
Some, O
too O
(but O
these, O
you O
may O
be O
sure, O
would O
sit O
at O
the O
bottom O
of O
the O
table), O
wore O
their O
best O
blouses-- O
that O
is O
to O
say, O
with O
collars O
turned O
down O
to O
the O
shoulders, O
the O
back O
gathered O
into O
small O
plaits O
and O
the O
waist O
fastened O
very O
low O
down O
with O
a O
worked O
belt. O
And O
the O
shirts O
stood O
out O
from O
the O
chests O
like O
cuirasses! O
Everyone O
had O
just O
had O
his O
hair O
cut; O
ears O
stood O
out O
from O
the O
heads; O
they O
had O
been O
close-shaved; O
a O
few, O
even, O
who O
had O
had O
to O
get O
up O
before O
daybreak, O
and O
not O
been O
able O
to O
see O
to O
shave, O
had O
diagonal O
gashes O
under O
their O
noses O
or O
cuts O
the O
size O
of O
a O
three-franc O
piece O
along O
the O
jaws, O
which O
the O
fresh O
air O
en O
route O
had O
enflamed, O
so O
that O
the O
great O
white O
beaming O
faces O
were O
mottled O
here O
and O
there O
with O
red O
dabs. O
The O
mairie O
was O
a O
mile O
and O
a O
half O
from O
the O
farm, O
and O
they O
went O
thither O
on O
foot, O
returning O
in O
the O
same O
way O
after O
the O
ceremony O
in O
the O
church. O
The O
procession, O
first O
united O
like O
one O
long O
coloured O
scarf O
that O
undulated O
across O
the O
fields, O
along O
the O
narrow O
path O
winding O
amid O
the O
green O
corn, O
soon O
lengthened O
out, O
and O
broke O
up O
into O
different O
groups O
that O
loitered O
to O
talk. O
The O
fiddler O
walked O
in O
front O
with O
his O
violin, O
gay O
with O
ribbons O
at O
its O
pegs. O
Then O
came O
the O
married O
pair, O
the O
relations, O
the O
friends, O
all O
following O
pell-mell; O
the O
children O
stayed O
behind O
amusing O
themselves O
plucking O
the O
bell-flowers O
from O
oat-ears, O
or O
playing O
amongst O
themselves O
unseen. O
Emma's O
dress, O
too O
long, O
trailed O
a O
little O
on O
the O
ground; O
from O
time O
to O
time O
she O
stopped O
to O
pull O
it O
up, O
and O
then O
delicately, O
with O
her O
gloved O
hands, O
she O
picked O
off O
the O
coarse O
grass O
and O
the O
thistledowns, O
while O
Charles, O
empty O
handed, O
waited O
till O
she O
had O
finished. O
Old O
Rouault, O
with O
a O
new O
silk O
hat O
and O
the O
cuffs O
of O
his O
black O
coat O
covering O
his O
hands O
up O
to O
the O
nails, O
gave O
his O
arm O
to O
Madame O
Bovary O
senior. O
As O
to O
Monsieur O
Bovary O
senior, O
who, O
heartily O
despising O
all O
these O
folk, O
had O
come O
simply O
in O
a O
frock-coat O
of O
military O
cut O
with O
one O
row O
of O
buttons-- O
he O
was O
passing O
compliments O
of O
the O
bar O
to O
a O
fair O
young O
peasant. O
She O
bowed, O
blushed, O
and O
did O
not O
know O
what O
to O
say. O
The O
other O
wedding O
guests O
talked O
of O
their O
business O
or O
played O
tricks O
behind O
each O
other's O
backs, O
egging O
one O
another O
on O
in O
advance O
to O
be O
jolly. O
Those O
who O
listened O
could O
always O
catch O
the O
squeaking O
of O
the O
fiddler, O
who O
went O
on O
playing O
across O
the O
fields. O
When O
he O
saw O
that O
the O
rest O
were O
far O
behind O
he O
stopped O
to O
take O
breath, O
slowly O
rosined O
his O
bow, O
so O
that O
the O
strings O
should O
sound O
more O
shrilly, O
then O
set O
off O
again, O
by O
turns O
lowering O
and O
raising O
his O
neck, O
the O
better O
to O
mark O
time O
for O
himself. O
The O
noise O
of O
the O
instrument O
drove O
away O
the O
little O
birds O
from O
afar. O
The O
table O
was O
laid O
under O
the O
cart-shed. O
On O
it O
were O
four O
sirloins, O
six O
chicken O
fricassees, O
stewed O
veal, O
three O
legs O
of O
mutton, O
and O
in O
the O
middle O
a O
fine O
roast O
suckling O
pig, O
flanked O
by O
four O
chitterlings O
with O
sorrel. O
At O
the O
corners O
were O
decanters O
of O
brandy. O
Sweet O
bottled-cider O
frothed O
round O
the O
corks, O
and O
all O
the O
glasses O
had O
been O
filled O
to O
the O
brim O
with O
wine O
beforehand. O
Large O
dishes O
of O
yellow O
cream, O
that O
trembled O
with O
the O
least O
shake O
of O
the O
table, O
had O
designed O
on O
their O
smooth O
surface O
the O
initials O
of O
the O
newly O
wedded O
pair O
in O
nonpareil O
arabesques. O
A O
confectioner O
of O
Yvetot O
had O
been O
intrusted O
with O
the O
tarts O
and O
sweets. O
As O
he O
had O
only O
just O
set O
up O
on O
the O
place, O
he O
had O
taken O
a O
lot O
of O
trouble, O
and O
at O
dessert O
he O
himself O
brought O
in O
a O
set O
dish O
that O
evoked O
loud O
cries O
of O
wonderment. O
To O
begin O
with, O
at O
its O
base O
there O
was O
a O
square O
of O
blue O
cardboard, O
representing O
a O
temple O
with O
porticoes, O
colonnades, O
and O
stucco O
statuettes O
all O
round, O
and O
in O
the O
niches O
constellations O
of O
gilt O
paper O
stars; O
then O
on O
the O
second O
stage O
was O
a O
dungeon O
of O
Savoy O
cake, O
surrounded O
by O
many O
fortifications O
in O
candied O
angelica, O
almonds, O
raisins, O
and O
quarters O
of O
oranges; O
and O
finally, O
on O
the O
upper O
platform O
a O
green O
field O
with O
rocks O
set O
in O
lakes O
of O
jam, O
nutshell O
boats, O
and O
a O
small O
Cupid O
balancing O
himself O
in O
a O
chocolate O
swing O
whose O
two O
uprights O
ended O
in O
real O
roses O
for O
balls O
at O
the O
top. O
Until O
night O
they O
ate. O
When O
any O
of O
them O
were O
too O
tired O
of O
sitting, O
they O
went O
out O
for O
a O
stroll O
in O
the O
yard, O
or O
for O
a O
game O
with O
corks O
in O
the O
granary, O
and O
then O
returned O
to O
table. O
Some O
towards O
the O
finish O
went O
to O
sleep O
and O
snored. O
But O
with O
the O
coffee O
everyone O
woke O
up. O
Then O
they O
began O
songs, O
showed O
off O
tricks, O
raised O
heavy O
weights, O
performed O
feats O
with O
their O
fingers, O
then O
tried O
lifting O
carts O
on O
their O
shoulders, O
made O
broad O
jokes, O
kissed O
the O
women. O
At O
night O
when O
they O
left, O
the O
horses, O
stuffed O
up O
to O
the O
nostrils O
with O
oats, O
could O
hardly O
be O
got O
into O
the O
shafts; O
they O
kicked, O
reared, O
the O
harness O
broke, O
their O
masters O
laughed O
or O
swore; O
and O
all O
night O
in O
the O
light O
of O
the O
moon O
along O
country O
roads O
there O
were O
runaway O
carts O
at O
full O
gallop O
plunging O
into O
the O
ditches, O
jumping O
over O
yard O
after O
yard O
of O
stones, O
clambering O
up O
the O
hills, O
with O
women O
leaning O
out O
from O
the O
tilt O
to O
catch O
hold O
of O
the O
reins. O
Those O
who O
stayed O
at O
the O
Bertaux O
spent O
the O
night O
drinking O
in O
the O
kitchen. O
The O
children O
had O
fallen O
asleep O
under O
the O
seats. O
The O
bride O
had O
begged O
her O
father O
to O
be O
spared O
the O
usual O
marriage O
pleasantries. O
However, O
a O
fishmonger, O
one O
of O
their O
cousins O
(who O
had O
even O
brought O
a O
pair O
of O
soles O
for O
his O
wedding O
present), O
began O
to O
squirt O
water O
from O
his O
mouth O
through O
the O
keyhole, O
when O
old O
Rouault O
came O
up O
just O
in O
time O
to O
stop O
him, O
and O
explain O
to O
him O
that O
the O
distinguished O
position O
of O
his O
son-in-law O
would O
not O
allow O
of O
such O
liberties. O
The O
cousin O
all O
the O
same O
did O
not O
give O
in O
to O
these O
reasons O
readily. O
In O
his O
heart O
he O
accused O
old O
Rouault O
of O
being O
proud, O
and O
he O
joined O
four O
or O
five O
other O
guests O
in O
a O
corner, O
who O
having, O
through O
mere O
chance, O
been O
several O
times O
running O
served O
with O
the O
worst O
helps O
of O
meat, O
also O
were O
of O
opinion O
they O
had O
been O
badly O
used, O
and O
were O
whispering O
about O
their O
host, O
and O
with O
covered O
hints O
hoping O
he O
would O
ruin O
himself. O
Madame O
Bovary, O
senior, O
had O
not O
opened O
her O
mouth O
all O
day. O
She O
had O
been O
consulted O
neither O
as O
to O
the O
dress O
of O
her O
daughter-in-law O
nor O
as O
to O
the O
arrangement O
of O
the O
feast; O
she O
went O
to O
bed O
early. O
Her O
husband, O
instead O
of O
following O
her, O
sent O
to O
Saint-Victor O
for O
some O
cigars, O
and O
smoked O
till O
daybreak, O
drinking O
kirsch-punch, O
a O
mixture O
unknown O
to O
the O
company. O
This O
added O
greatly O
to O
the O
consideration O
in O
which O
he O
was O
held. O
Charles, O
who O
was O
not O
of O
a O
facetious O
turn, O
did O
not O
shine O
at O
the O
wedding. O
He O
answered O
feebly O
to O
the O
puns, O
doubles O
entendres, O
compliments, O
and O
chaff O
that O
it O
was O
felt O
a O
duty O
to O
let O
off O
at O
him O
as O
soon O
as O
the O
soup O
appeared. O
DOUBLE O
MEANINGS. O
The O
next O
day, O
on O
the O
other O
hand, O
he O
seemed O
another O
man. O
It O
was O
he O
who O
might O
rather O
have O
been O
taken O
for O
the O
virgin O
of O
the O
evening O
before, O
whilst O
the O
bride O
gave O
no O
sign O
that O
revealed O
anything. O
The O
shrewdest O
did O
not O
know O
what O
to O
make O
of O
it, O
and O
they O
looked O
at O
her O
when O
she O
passed O
near O
them O
with O
an O
unbounded O
concentration O
of O
mind. O
But O
Charles O
concealed O
nothing. O
He O
called O
her O
"my O
wife", O
tutoyed O
her, O
asked O
for O
her O
of O
everyone, O
looked O
for O
her O
everywhere, O
and O
often O
he O
dragged O
her O
into O
the O
yards, O
where O
he O
could O
be O
seen O
from O
far O
between O
the O
trees, O
putting O
his O
arm O
around O
her O
waist, O
and O
walking O
half-bending O
over O
her, O
ruffling O
the O
chemisette O
of O
her O
bodice O
with O
his O
head. O
USED O
THE O
FAMILIAR O
FORM O
OF O
ADDRESS. O
Two O
days O
after O
the O
wedding O
the O
married O
pair O
left. O
Charles, O
on O
account O
of O
his O
patients, O
could O
not O
be O
away O
longer. O
Old O
Rouault O
had O
them O
driven O
back O
in O
his O
cart, O
and O
himself O
accompanied O
them O
as O
far O
as O
Vassonville. O
Here O
he O
embraced O
his O
daughter O
for O
the O
last O
time, O
got O
down, O
and O
went O
his O
way. O
When O
he O
had O
gone O
about O
a O
hundred O
paces O
he O
stopped, O
and O
as O
he O
saw O
the O
cart O
disappearing, O
its O
wheels O
turning O
in O
the O
dust, O
he O
gave O
a O
deep O
sigh. O
Then O
he O
remembered O
his O
wedding, O
the O
old O
times, O
the O
first O
pregnancy O
of O
his O
wife; O
he, O
too, O
had O
been O
very O
happy O
the O
day O
when O
he O
had O
taken O
her O
from O
her O
father O
to O
his O
home, O
and O
had O
carried O
her O
off O
on O
a O
pillion, O
trotting O
through O
the O
snow, O
for O
it O
was O
near O
Christmas-time, O
and O
the O
country O
was O
all O
white. O
She O
held O
him O
by O
one O
arm, O
her O
basket O
hanging O
from O
the O
other; O
the O
wind O
blew O
the O
long O
lace O
of O
her O
Cauchois O
headdress O
so O
that O
it O
sometimes O
flapped O
across O
his O
mouth, O
and O
when O
he O
turned O
his O
head O
he O
saw O
near O
him, O
on O
his O
shoulder, O
her O
little O
rosy O
face, O
smiling O
silently O
under O
the O
gold O
bands O
of O
her O
cap. O
To O
warm O
her O
hands O
she O
put O
them O
from O
time O
to O
time O
in O
his O
breast. O
How O
long O
ago O
it O
all O
was! O
Their O
son O
would O
have O
been O
thirty O
by O
now. O
Then O
he O
looked O
back O
and O
saw O
nothing O
on O
the O
road. O
He O
felt O
dreary O
as O
an O
empty O
house; O
and O
tender O
memories O
mingling O
with O
the O
sad O
thoughts O
in O
his O
brain, O
addled O
by O
the O
fumes O
of O
the O
feast, O
he O
felt O
inclined O
for O
a O
moment O
to O
take O
a O
turn O
towards O
the O
church. O
As O
he O
was O
afraid, O
however, O
that O
this O
sight O
would O
make O
him O
yet O
more O
sad, O
he O
went O
right O
away O
home. O
Monsieur O
and O
Madame O
Charles O
arrived O
at O
Tostes O
about O
six O
o'clock. O
The O
neighbors O
came O
to O
the O
windows O
to O
see O
their O
doctor's O
new O
wife. O
The O
old O
servant O
presented O
herself, O
curtsied O
to O
her, O
apologised O
for O
not O
having O
dinner O
ready, O
and O
suggested O
that O
madame, O
in O
the O
meantime, O
should O
look O
over O
her O
house. O
CHAPTER O
FIVE O
The O
brick O
front O
was O
just O
in O
a O
line O
with O
the O
street, O
or O
rather O
the O
road. O
Behind O
the O
door O
hung O
a O
cloak O
with O
a O
small O
collar, O
a O
bridle, O
and O
a O
black O
leather O
cap, O
and O
on O
the O
floor, O
in O
a O
corner, O
were O
a O
pair O
of O
leggings, O
still O
covered O
with O
dry O
mud. O
On O
the O
right O
was O
the O
one O
apartment, O
that O
was O
both O
dining O
and O
sitting O
room. O
A O
canary O
yellow O
paper, O
relieved O
at O
the O
top O
by O
a O
garland O
of O
pale O
flowers, O
was O
puckered O
everywhere O
over O
the O
badly O
stretched O
canvas; O
white O
calico O
curtains O
with O
a O
red O
border O
hung O
crossways O
at O
the O
length O
of O
the O
window; O
and O
on O
the O
narrow O
mantelpiece O
a O
clock O
with O
a O
head O
of O
Hippocrates O
shone O
resplendent O
between O
two O
plate O
candlesticks O
under O
oval O
shades. O
On O
the O
other O
side O
of O
the O
passage O
was O
Charles's O
consulting O
room, O
a O
little O
room O
about O
six O
paces O
wide, O
with O
a O
table, O
three O
chairs, O
and O
an O
office O
chair. O
Volumes O
of O
the O
"Dictionary O
of O
Medical O
Science," O
uncut, O
but O
the O
binding O
rather O
the O
worse O
for O
the O
successive O
sales O
through O
which O
they O
had O
gone, O
occupied O
almost O
along O
the O
six O
shelves O
of O
a O
deal O
bookcase. O
The O
smell O
of O
melted O
butter O
penetrated O
through O
the O
walls O
when O
he O
saw O
patients, O
just O
as O
in O
the O
kitchen O
one O
could O
hear O
the O
people O
coughing O
in O
the O
consulting O
room O
and O
recounting O
their O
histories. O
Then, O
opening O
on O
the O
yard, O
where O
the O
stable O
was, O
came O
a O
large O
dilapidated O
room O
with O
a O
stove, O
now O
used O
as O
a O
wood-house, O
cellar, O
and O
pantry, O
full O
of O
old O
rubbish, O
of O
empty O
casks, O
agricultural O
implements O
past O
service, O
and O
a O
mass O
of O
dusty O
things O
whose O
use O
it O
was O
impossible O
to O
guess. O
The O
garden, O
longer O
than O
wide, O
ran O
between O
two O
mud O
walls O
with O
espaliered O
apricots, O
to O
a O
hawthorn O
hedge O
that O
separated O
it O
from O
the O
field. O
In O
the O
middle O
was O
a O
slate O
sundial O
on O
a O
brick O
pedestal; O
four O
flower O
beds O
with O
eglantines O
surrounded O
symmetrically O
the O
more O
useful O
kitchen O
garden O
bed. O
Right O
at O
the O
bottom, O
under O
the O
spruce O
bushes, O
was O
a O
cure O
in O
plaster O
reading O
his O
breviary. O
Emma O
went O
upstairs. O
The O
first O
room O
was O
not O
furnished, O
but O
in O
the O
second, O
which O
was O
their O
bedroom, O
was O
a O
mahogany O
bedstead O
in O
an O
alcove O
with O
red O
drapery. O
A O
shell O
box O
adorned O
the O
chest O
of O
drawers, O
and O
on O
the O
secretary O
near O
the O
window O
a O
bouquet O
of O
orange O
blossoms O
tied O
with O
white O
satin O
ribbons O
stood O
in O
a O
bottle. O
It O
was O
a O
bride's O
bouquet; O
it O
was O
the O
other O
one's. O
She O
looked O
at O
it. O
Charles O
noticed O
it; O
he O
took O
it O
and O
carried O
it O
up O
to O
the O
attic, O
while O
Emma O
seated O
in O
an O
arm-chair O
(they O
were O
putting O
her O
things O
down O
around O
her) O
thought O
of O
her O
bridal O
flowers O
packed O
up O
in O
a O
bandbox, O
and O
wondered, O
dreaming, O
what O
would O
be O
done O
with O
them O
if O
she O
were O
to O
die. O
During O
the O
first O
days O
she O
occupied O
herself O
in O
thinking O
about O
changes O
in O
the O
house. O
She O
took O
the O
shades O
off O
the O
candlesticks, O
had O
new O
wallpaper O
put O
up, O
the O
staircase O
repainted, O
and O
seats O
made O
in O
the O
garden O
round O
the O
sundial; O
she O
even O
inquired O
how O
she O
could O
get O
a O
basin O
with O
a O
jet O
fountain O
and O
fishes. O
Finally O
her O
husband, O
knowing O
that O
she O
liked O
to O
drive O
out, O
picked O
up O
a O
second-hand O
dogcart, O
which, O
with O
new O
lamps O
and O
splashboard O
in O
striped O
leather, O
looked O
almost O
like O
a O
tilbury. O
He O
was O
happy O
then, O
and O
without O
a O
care O
in O
the O
world. O
A O
meal O
together, O
a O
walk O
in O
the O
evening O
on O
the O
highroad, O
a O
gesture O
of O
her O
hands O
over O
her O
hair, O
the O
sight O
of O
her O
straw O
hat O
hanging O
from O
the O
window-fastener, O
and O
many O
another O
thing O
in O
which O
Charles O
had O
never O
dreamed O
of O
pleasure, O
now O
made O
up O
the O
endless O
round O
of O
his O
happiness. O
In O
bed, O
in O
the O
morning, O
by O
her O
side, O
on O
the O
pillow, O
he O
watched O
the O
sunlight O
sinking O
into O
the O
down O
on O
her O
fair O
cheek, O
half O
hidden O
by O
the O
lappets O
of O
her O
night-cap. O
Seen O
thus O
closely, O
her O
eyes O
looked O
to O
him O
enlarged, O
especially O
when, O
on O
waking O
up, O
she O
opened O
and O
shut O
them O
rapidly O
many O
times. O
Black O
in O
the O
shade, O
dark O
blue O
in O
broad O
daylight, O
they O
had, O
as O
it O
were, O
depths O
of O
different O
colours, O
that, O
darker O
in O
the O
centre, O
grew O
paler O
towards O
the O
surface O
of O
the O
eye. O
His O
own O
eyes O
lost O
themselves O
in O
these O
depths; O
he O
saw O
himself O
in O
miniature O
down O
to O
the O
shoulders, O
with O
his O
handkerchief O
round O
his O
head O
and O
the O
top O
of O
his O
shirt O
open. O
He O
rose. O
She O
came O
to O
the O
window O
to O
see O
him O
off, O
and O
stayed O
leaning O
on O
the O
sill O
between O
two O
pots O
of O
geranium, O
clad O
in O
her O
dressing O
gown O
hanging O
loosely O
about O
her. O
Charles, O
in O
the O
street O
buckled O
his O
spurs, O
his O
foot O
on O
the O
mounting O
stone, O
while O
she O
talked O
to O
him O
from O
above, O
picking O
with O
her O
mouth O
some O
scrap O
of O
flower O
or O
leaf O
that O
she O
blew O
out O
at O
him. O
Then O
this, O
eddying, O
floating, O
described O
semicircles O
in O
the O
air O
like O
a O
bird, O
and O
was O
caught O
before O
it O
reached O
the O
ground O
in O
the O
ill-groomed O
mane O
of O
the O
old O
white O
mare O
standing O
motionless O
at O
the O
door. O
Charles O
from O
horseback O
threw O
her O
a O
kiss; O
she O
answered O
with O
a O
nod; O
she O
shut O
the O
window, O
and O
he O
set O
off. O
And O
then O
along O
the O
highroad, O
spreading O
out O
its O
long O
ribbon O
of O
dust, O
along O
the O
deep O
lanes O
that O
the O
trees O
bent O
over O
as O
in O
arbours, O
along O
paths O
where O
the O
corn O
reached O
to O
the O
knees, O
with O
the O
sun O
on O
his O
back O
and O
the O
morning O
air O
in O
his O
nostrils, O
his O
heart O
full O
of O
the O
joys O
of O
the O
past O
night, O
his O
mind O
at O
rest, O
his O
flesh O
at O
ease, O
he O
went O
on, O
re-chewing O
his O
happiness, O
like O
those O
who O
after O
dinner O
taste O
again O
the O
truffles O
which O
they O
are O
digesting. O
Until O
now O
what O
good O
had O
he O
had O
of O
his O
life? O
His O
time O
at O
school, O
when O
he O
remained O
shut O
up O
within O
the O
high O
walls, O
alone, O
in O
the O
midst O
of O
companions O
richer O
than O
he O
or O
cleverer O
at O
their O
work, O
who O
laughed O
at O
his O
accent, O
who O
jeered O
at O
his O
clothes, O
and O
whose O
mothers O
came O
to O
the O
school O
with O
cakes O
in O
their O
muffs? O
Later O
on, O
when O
he O
studied O
medicine, O
and O
never O
had O
his O
purse O
full O
enough O
to O
treat O
some O
little O
work-girl O
who O
would O
have O
become O
his O
mistress? O
Afterwards, O
he O
had O
lived O
fourteen O
months O
with O
the O
widow, O
whose O
feet O
in O
bed O
were O
cold O
as O
icicles. O
But O
now O
he O
had O
for O
life O
this O
beautiful O
woman O
whom O
he O
adored. O
For O
him O
the O
universe O
did O
not O
extend O
beyond O
the O
circumference O
of O
her O
petticoat, O
and O
he O
reproached O
himself O
with O
not O
loving O
her. O
He O
wanted O
to O
see O
her O
again; O
he O
turned O
back O
quickly, O
ran O
up O
the O
stairs O
with O
a O
beating O
heart. O
Emma, O
in O
her O
room, O
was O
dressing; O
he O
came O
up O
on O
tiptoe, O
kissed O
her O
back; O
she O
gave O
a O
cry. O
He O
could O
not O
keep O
from O
constantly O
touching O
her O
comb, O
her O
ring, O
her O
fichu; O
sometimes O
he O
gave O
her O
great O
sounding O
kisses O
with O
all O
his O
mouth O
on O
her O
cheeks, O
or O
else O
little O
kisses O
in O
a O
row O
all O
along O
her O
bare O
arm O
from O
the O
tip O
of O
her O
fingers O
up O
to O
her O
shoulder, O
and O
she O
put O
him O
away O
half-smiling, O
half-vexed, O
as O
you O
do O
a O
child O
who O
hangs O
about O
you. O
Before O
marriage O
she O
thought O
herself O
in O
love; O
but O
the O
happiness O
that O
should O
have O
followed O
this O
love O
not O
having O
come, O
she O
must, O
she O
thought, O
have O
been O
mistaken. O
And O
Emma O
tried O
to O
find O
out O
what O
one O
meant O
exactly O
in O
life O
by O
the O
words O
felicity, O
passion, O
rapture, O
that O
had O
seemed O
to O
her O
so O
beautiful O
in O
books. O
CHAPTER O
SIX O
She O
had O
read O
"Paul O
and O
Virginia," O
and O
she O
had O
dreamed O
of O
the O
little O
bamboo-house, O
the O
nigger O
Domingo, O
the O
dog O
Fidele, O
but O
above O
all O
of O
the O
sweet O
friendship O
of O
some O
dear O
little O
brother, O
who O
seeks O
red O
fruit O
for O
you O
on O
trees O
taller O
than O
steeples, O
or O
who O
runs O
barefoot O
over O
the O
sand, O
bringing O
you O
a O
bird's O
nest. O
When O
she O
was O
thirteen, O
her O
father O
himself O
took O
her O
to O
town O
to O
place O
her O
in O
the O
convent. O
They O
stopped O
at O
an O
inn O
in O
the O
St. O
Gervais O
quarter, O
where, O
at O
their O
supper, O
they O
used O
painted O
plates O
that O
set O
forth O
the O
story O
of O
Mademoiselle O
de O
la O
Valliere. O
The O
explanatory O
legends, O
chipped O
here O
and O
there O
by O
the O
scratching O
of O
knives, O
all O
glorified O
religion, O
the O
tendernesses O
of O
the O
heart, O
and O
the O
pomps O
of O
court. O
Far O
from O
being O
bored O
at O
first O
at O
the O
convent, O
she O
took O
pleasure O
in O
the O
society O
of O
the O
good O
sisters, O
who, O
to O
amuse O
her, O
took O
her O
to O
the O
chapel, O
which O
one O
entered O
from O
the O
refectory O
by O
a O
long O
corridor. O
She O
played O
very O
little O
during O
recreation O
hours, O
knew O
her O
catechism O
well, O
and O
it O
was O
she O
who O
always O
answered O
Monsieur O
le O
Vicaire's O
difficult O
questions. O
Living O
thus, O
without O
every O
leaving O
the O
warm O
atmosphere O
of O
the O
classrooms, O
and O
amid O
these O
pale-faced O
women O
wearing O
rosaries O
with O
brass O
crosses, O
she O
was O
softly O
lulled O
by O
the O
mystic O
languor O
exhaled O
in O
the O
perfumes O
of O
the O
altar, O
the O
freshness O
of O
the O
holy O
water, O
and O
the O
lights O
of O
the O
tapers. O
Instead O
of O
attending O
to O
mass, O
she O
looked O
at O
the O
pious O
vignettes O
with O
their O
azure O
borders O
in O
her O
book, O
and O
she O
loved O
the O
sick O
lamb, O
the O
sacred O
heart O
pierced O
with O
sharp O
arrows, O
or O
the O
poor O
Jesus O
sinking O
beneath O
the O
cross O
he O
carries. O
She O
tried, O
by O
way O
of O
mortification, O
to O
eat O
nothing O
a O
whole O
day. O
She O
puzzled O
her O
head O
to O
find O
some O
vow O
to O
fulfil. O
When O
she O
went O
to O
confession, O
she O
invented O
little O
sins O
in O
order O
that O
she O
might O
stay O
there O
longer, O
kneeling O
in O
the O
shadow, O
her O
hands O
joined, O
her O
face O
against O
the O
grating O
beneath O
the O
whispering O
of O
the O
priest. O
The O
comparisons O
of O
betrothed, O
husband, O
celestial O
lover, O
and O
eternal O
marriage, O
that O
recur O
in O
sermons, O
stirred O
within O
her O
soul O
depths O
of O
unexpected O
sweetness. O
In O
the O
evening, O
before O
prayers, O
there O
was O
some O
religious O
reading O
in O
the O
study. O
On O
week-nights O
it O
was O
some O
abstract O
of O
sacred O
history O
or O
the O
Lectures O
of O
the O
Abbe O
Frayssinous, O
and O
on O
Sundays O
passages O
from O
the O
"Genie O
du O
Christianisme," O
as O
a O
recreation. O
How O
she O
listened O
at O
first O
to O
the O
sonorous O
lamentations O
of O
its O
romantic O
melancholies O
reechoing O
through O
the O
world O
and O
eternity! O
If O
her O
childhood O
had O
been O
spent O
in O
the O
shop-parlour O
of O
some O
business O
quarter, O
she O
might O
perhaps O
have O
opened O
her O
heart O
to O
those O
lyrical O
invasions O
of O
Nature, O
which O
usually O
come O
to O
us O
only O
through O
translation O
in O
books. O
But O
she O
knew O
the O
country O
too O
well; O
she O
knew O
the O
lowing O
of O
cattle, O
the O
milking, O
the O
ploughs. O
Accustomed O
to O
calm O
aspects O
of O
life, O
she O
turned, O
on O
the O
contrary, O
to O
those O
of O
excitement. O
She O
loved O
the O
sea O
only O
for O
the O
sake O
of O
its O
storms, O
and O
the O
green O
fields O
only O
when O
broken O
up O
by O
ruins. O
She O
wanted O
to O
get O
some O
personal O
profit O
out O
of O
things, O
and O
she O
rejected O
as O
useless O
all O
that O
did O
not O
contribute O
to O
the O
immediate O
desires O
of O
her O
heart, O
being O
of O
a O
temperament O
more O
sentimental O
than O
artistic, O
looking O
for O
emotions, O
not O
landscapes. O
At O
the O
convent O
there O
was O
an O
old O
maid O
who O
came O
for O
a O
week O
each O
month O
to O
mend O
the O
linen. O
Patronized O
by O
the O
clergy, O
because O
she O
belonged O
to O
an O
ancient O
family O
of O
noblemen O
ruined O
by O
the O
Revolution, O
she O
dined O
in O
the O
refectory O
at O
the O
table O
of O
the O
good O
sisters, O
and O
after O
the O
meal O
had O
a O
bit O
of O
chat O
with O
them O
before O
going O
back O
to O
her O
work. O
The O
girls O
often O
slipped O
out O
from O
the O
study O
to O
go O
and O
see O
her. O
She O
knew O
by O
heart O
the O
love O
songs O
of O
the O
last O
century, O
and O
sang O
them O
in O
a O
low O
voice O
as O
she O
stitched O
away. O
She O
told O
stories, O
gave O
them O
news, O
went O
errands O
in O
the O
town, O
and O
on O
the O
sly O
lent O
the O
big O
girls O
some O
novel, O
that O
she O
always O
carried O
in O
the O
pockets O
of O
her O
apron, O
and O
of O
which O
the O
good O
lady O
herself O
swallowed O
long O
chapters O
in O
the O
intervals O
of O
her O
work. O
They O
were O
all O
love, O
lovers, O
sweethearts, O
persecuted O
ladies O
fainting O
in O
lonely O
pavilions, O
postilions O
killed O
at O
every O
stage, O
horses O
ridden O
to O
death O
on O
every O
page, O
sombre O
forests, O
heartaches, O
vows, O
sobs, O
tears O
and O
kisses, O
little O
skiffs O
by O
moonlight, O
nightingales O
in O
shady O
groves, O
"gentlemen" O
brave O
as O
lions, O
gentle O
as O
lambs, O
virtuous O
as O
no O
one O
ever O
was, O
always O
well O
dressed, O
and O
weeping O
like O
fountains. O
For O
six O
months, O
then, O
Emma, O
at O
fifteen O
years O
of O
age, O
made O
her O
hands O
dirty O
with O
books O
from O
old O
lending O
libraries. O
Through O
Walter O
Scott, O
later O
on, O
she O
fell O
in O
love O
with O
historical O
events, O
dreamed O
of O
old O
chests, O
guard-rooms O
and O
minstrels. O
She O
would O
have O
liked O
to O
live O
in O
some O
old O
manor-house, O
like O
those O
long-waisted O
chatelaines O
who, O
in O
the O
shade O
of O
pointed O
arches, O
spent O
their O
days O
leaning O
on O
the O
stone, O
chin O
in O
hand, O
watching O
a O
cavalier O
with O
white O
plume O
galloping O
on O
his O
black O
horse O
from O
the O
distant O
fields. O
At O
this O
time O
she O
had O
a O
cult O
for O
Mary O
Stuart O
and O
enthusiastic O
veneration O
for O
illustrious O
or O
unhappy O
women. O
Joan O
of O
Arc, O
Heloise, O
Agnes O
Sorel, O
the O
beautiful O
Ferroniere, O
and O
Clemence O
Isaure O
stood O
out O
to O
her O
like O
comets O
in O
the O
dark O
immensity O
of O
heaven, O
where O
also O
were O
seen, O
lost O
in O
shadow, O
and O
all O
unconnected, O
St. O
Louis O
with O
his O
oak, O
the O
dying O
Bayard, O
some O
cruelties O
of O
Louis O
XI, O
a O
little O
of O
St. O
Bartholomew's O
Day, O
the O
plume O
of O
the O
Bearnais, O
and O
always O
the O
remembrance O
of O
the O
plates O
painted O
in O
honour O
of O
Louis O
XIV. O
In O
the O
music O
class, O
in O
the O
ballads O
she O
sang, O
there O
was O
nothing O
but O
little O
angels O
with O
golden O
wings, O
madonnas, O
lagunes, O
gondoliers;-mild O
compositions O
that O
allowed O
her O
to O
catch O
a O
glimpse O
athwart O
the O
obscurity O
of O
style O
and O
the O
weakness O
of O
the O
music O
of O
the O
attractive O
phantasmagoria O
of O
sentimental O
realities. O
Some O
of O
her O
companions O
brought O
"keepsakes" O
given O
them O
as O
new O
year's O
gifts O
to O
the O
convent. O
These O
had O
to O
be O
hidden; O
it O
was O
quite O
an O
undertaking; O
they O
were O
read O
in O
the O
dormitory. O
Delicately O
handling O
the O
beautiful O
satin O
bindings, O
Emma O
looked O
with O
dazzled O
eyes O
at O
the O
names O
of O
the O
unknown O
authors, O
who O
had O
signed O
their O
verses O
for O
the O
most O
part O
as O
counts O
or O
viscounts. O
She O
trembled O
as O
she O
blew O
back O
the O
tissue O
paper O
over O
the O
engraving O
and O
saw O
it O
folded O
in O
two O
and O
fall O
gently O
against O
the O
page. O
Here O
behind O
the O
balustrade O
of O
a O
balcony O
was O
a O
young O
man O
in O
a O
short O
cloak, O
holding O
in O
his O
arms O
a O
young O
girl O
in O
a O
white O
dress O
wearing O
an O
alms-bag O
at O
her O
belt; O
or O
there O
were O
nameless O
portraits O
of O
English O
ladies O
with O
fair O
curls, O
who O
looked O
at O
you O
from O
under O
their O
round O
straw O
hats O
with O
their O
large O
clear O
eyes. O
Some O
there O
were O
lounging O
in O
their O
carriages, O
gliding O
through O
parks, O
a O
greyhound O
bounding O
along O
in O
front O
of O
the O
equipage O
driven O
at O
a O
trot O
by O
two O
midget O
postilions O
in O
white O
breeches. O
Others, O
dreaming O
on O
sofas O
with O
an O
open O
letter, O
gazed O
at O
the O
moon O
through O
a O
slightly O
open O
window O
half O
draped O
by O
a O
black O
curtain. O
The O
naive O
ones, O
a O
tear O
on O
their O
cheeks, O
were O
kissing O
doves O
through O
the O
bars O
of O
a O
Gothic O
cage, O
or, O
smiling, O
their O
heads O
on O
one O
side, O
were O
plucking O
the O
leaves O
of O
a O
marguerite O
with O
their O
taper O
fingers, O
that O
curved O
at O
the O
tips O
like O
peaked O
shoes. O
And O
you, O
too, O
were O
there, O
Sultans O
with O
long O
pipes O
reclining O
beneath O
arbours O
in O
the O
arms O
of O
Bayaderes; O
Djiaours, O
Turkish O
sabres, O
Greek O
caps; O
and O
you O
especially, O
pale O
landscapes O
of O
dithyrambic O
lands, O
that O
often O
show O
us O
at O
once O
palm O
trees O
and O
firs, O
tigers O
on O
the O
right, O
a O
lion O
to O
the O
left, O
Tartar O
minarets O
on O
the O
horizon; O
the O
whole O
framed O
by O
a O
very O
neat O
virgin O
forest, O
and O
with O
a O
great O
perpendicular O
sunbeam O
trembling O
in O
the O
water, O
where, O
standing O
out O
in O
relief O
like O
white O
excoriations O
on O
a O
steel-grey O
ground, O
swans O
are O
swimming O
about. O
And O
the O
shade O
of O
the O
argand O
lamp O
fastened O
to O
the O
wall O
above O
Emma's O
head O
lighted O
up O
all O
these O
pictures O
of O
the O
world, O
that O
passed O
before O
her O
one O
by O
one O
in O
the O
silence O
of O
the O
dormitory, O
and O
to O
the O
distant O
noise O
of O
some O
belated O
carriage O
rolling O
over O
the O
Boulevards. O
When O
her O
mother O
died O
she O
cried O
much O
the O
first O
few O
days. O
She O
had O
a O
funeral O
picture O
made O
with O
the O
hair O
of O
the O
deceased, O
and, O
in O
a O
letter O
sent O
to O
the O
Bertaux O
full O
of O
sad O
reflections O
on O
life, O
she O
asked O
to O
be O
buried O
later O
on O
in O
the O
same O
grave. O
The O
goodman O
thought O
she O
must O
be O
ill, O
and O
came O
to O
see O
her. O
Emma O
was O
secretly O
pleased O
that O
she O
had O
reached O
at O
a O
first O
attempt O
the O
rare O
ideal O
of O
pale O
lives, O
never O
attained O
by O
mediocre O
hearts. O
She O
let O
herself O
glide O
along O
with O
Lamartine O
meanderings, O
listened O
to O
harps O
on O
lakes, O
to O
all O
the O
songs O
of O
dying O
swans, O
to O
the O
falling O
of O
the O
leaves, O
the O
pure O
virgins O
ascending O
to O
heaven, O
and O
the O
voice O
of O
the O
Eternal O
discoursing O
down O
the O
valleys. O
She O
wearied O
of O
it, O
would O
not O
confess O
it, O
continued O
from O
habit, O
and O
at O
last O
was O
surprised O
to O
feel O
herself O
soothed, O
and O
with O
no O
more O
sadness O
at O
heart O
than O
wrinkles O
on O
her O
brow. O
The O
good O
nuns, O
who O
had O
been O
so O
sure O
of O
her O
vocation, O
perceived O
with O
great O
astonishment O
that O
Mademoiselle O
Rouault O
seemed O
to O
be O
slipping O
from O
them. O
They O
had O
indeed O
been O
so O
lavish O
to O
her O
of O
prayers, O
retreats, O
novenas, O
and O
sermons, O
they O
had O
so O
often O
preached O
the O
respect O
due O
to O
saints O
and O
martyrs, O
and O
given O
so O
much O
good O
advice O
as O
to O
the O
modesty O
of O
the O
body O
and O
the O
salvation O
of O
her O
soul, O
that O
she O
did O
as O
tightly O
reined O
horses; O
she O
pulled O
up O
short O
and O
the O
bit O
slipped O
from O
her O
teeth. O
This O
nature, O
positive O
in O
the O
midst O
of O
its O
enthusiasms, O
that O
had O
loved O
the O
church O
for O
the O
sake O
of O
the O
flowers, O
and O
music O
for O
the O
words O
of O
the O
songs, O
and O
literature O
for O
its O
passional O
stimulus, O
rebelled O
against O
the O
mysteries O
of O
faith O
as O
it O
grew O
irritated O
by O
discipline, O
a O
thing O
antipathetic O
to O
her O
constitution. O
When O
her O
father O
took O
her O
from O
school, O
no O
one O
was O
sorry O
to O
see O
her O
go. O
The O
Lady O
Superior O
even O
thought O
that O
she O
had O
latterly O
been O
somewhat O
irreverent O
to O
the O
community. O
Emma, O
at O
home O
once O
more, O
first O
took O
pleasure O
in O
looking O
after O
the O
servants, O
then O
grew O
disgusted O
with O
the O
country O
and O
missed O
her O
convent. O
When O
Charles O
came O
to O
the O
Bertaux O
for O
the O
first O
time, O
she O
thought O
herself O
quite O
disillusioned, O
with O
nothing O
more O
to O
learn, O
and O
nothing O
more O
to O
feel. O
But O
the O
uneasiness O
of O
her O
new O
position, O
or O
perhaps O
the O
disturbance O
caused O
by O
the O
presence O
of O
this O
man, O
had O
sufficed O
to O
make O
her O
believe O
that O
she O
at O
last O
felt O
that O
wondrous O
passion O
which, O
till O
then, O
like O
a O
great O
bird O
with O
rose-coloured O
wings, O
hung O
in O
the O
splendour O
of O
the O
skies O
of O
poesy; O
and O
now O
she O
could O
not O
think O
that O
the O
calm O
in O
which O
she O
lived O
was O
the O
happiness O
she O
had O
dreamed. O
CHAPTER O
SEVEN O
She O
thought, O
sometimes, O
that, O
after O
all, O
this O
was O
the O
happiest O
time O
of O
her O
life-- O
the O
honeymoon, O
as O
people O
called O
it. O
To O
taste O
the O
full O
sweetness O
of O
it, O
it O
would O
have O
been O
necessary O
doubtless O
to O
fly O
to O
those O
lands O
with O
sonorous O
names O
where O
the O
days O
after O
marriage O
are O
full O
of O
laziness O
most O
suave. O
In O
post O
chaises O
behind O
blue O
silken O
curtains O
to O
ride O
slowly O
up O
steep O
road, O
listening O
to O
the O
song O
of O
the O
postilion O
re-echoed O
by O
the O
mountains, O
along O
with O
the O
bells O
of O
goats O
and O
the O
muffled O
sound O
of O
a O
waterfall; O
at O
sunset O
on O
the O
shores O
of O
gulfs O
to O
breathe O
in O
the O
perfume O
of O
lemon O
trees; O
then O
in O
the O
evening O
on O
the O
villa-terraces O
above, O
hand O
in O
hand O
to O
look O
at O
the O
stars, O
making O
plans O
for O
the O
future. O
It O
seemed O
to O
her O
that O
certain O
places O
on O
earth O
must O
bring O
happiness, O
as O
a O
plant O
peculiar O
to O
the O
soil, O
and O
that O
cannot O
thrive O
elsewhere. O
Why O
could O
not O
she O
lean O
over O
balconies O
in O
Swiss O
chalets, O
or O
enshrine O
her O
melancholy O
in O
a O
Scotch O
cottage, O
with O
a O
husband O
dressed O
in O
a O
black O
velvet O
coat O
with O
long O
tails, O
and O
thin O
shoes, O
a O
pointed O
hat O
and O
frills? O
Perhaps O
she O
would O
have O
liked O
to O
confide O
all O
these O
things O
to O
someone. O
But O
how O
tell O
an O
undefinable O
uneasiness, O
variable O
as O
the O
clouds, O
unstable O
as O
the O
winds? O
Words O
failed O
her-- O
the O
opportunity, O
the O
courage. O
If O
Charles O
had O
but O
wished O
it, O
if O
he O
had O
guessed O
it, O
if O
his O
look O
had O
but O
once O
met O
her O
thought, O
it O
seemed O
to O
her O
that O
a O
sudden O
plenty O
would O
have O
gone O
out O
from O
her O
heart, O
as O
the O
fruit O
falls O
from O
a O
tree O
when O
shaken O
by O
a O
hand. O
But O
as O
the O
intimacy O
of O
their O
life O
became O
deeper, O
the O
greater O
became O
the O
gulf O
that O
separated O
her O
from O
him. O
Charles's O
conversation O
was O
commonplace O
as O
a O
street O
pavement, O
and O
everyone's O
ideas O
trooped O
through O
it O
in O
their O
everyday O
garb, O
without O
exciting O
emotion, O
laughter, O
or O
thought. O
He O
had O
never O
had O
the O
curiosity, O
he O
said, O
while O
he O
lived O
at O
Rouen, O
to O
go O
to O
the O
theatre O
to O
see O
the O
actors O
from O
Paris. O
He O
could O
neither O
swim, O
nor O
fence, O
nor O
shoot, O
and O
one O
day O
he O
could O
not O
explain O
some O
term O
of O
horsemanship O
to O
her O
that O
she O
had O
come O
across O
in O
a O
novel. O
A O
man, O
on O
the O
contrary, O
should O
he O
not O
know O
everything, O
excel O
in O
manifold O
activities, O
initiate O
you O
into O
the O
energies O
of O
passion, O
the O
refinements O
of O
life, O
all O
mysteries? O
But O
this O
one O
taught O
nothing, O
knew O
nothing, O
wished O
nothing. O
He O
thought O
her O
happy; O
and O
she O
resented O
this O
easy O
calm, O
this O
serene O
heaviness, O
the O
very O
happiness O
she O
gave O
him. O
Sometimes O
she O
would O
draw; O
and O
it O
was O
great O
amusement O
to O
Charles O
to O
stand O
there O
bolt O
upright O
and O
watch O
her O
bend O
over O
her O
cardboard, O
with O
eyes O
half-closed O
the O
better O
to O
see O
her O
work, O
or O
rolling, O
between O
her O
fingers, O
little O
bread-pellets. O
As O
to O
the O
piano, O
the O
more O
quickly O
her O
fingers O
glided O
over O
it O
the O
more O
he O
wondered. O
She O
struck O
the O
notes O
with O
aplomb, O
and O
ran O
from O
top O
to O
bottom O
of O
the O
keyboard O
without O
a O
break. O
Thus O
shaken O
up, O
the O
old O
instrument, O
whose O
strings O
buzzed, O
could O
be O
heard O
at O
the O
other O
end O
of O
the O
village O
when O
the O
window O
was O
open, O
and O
often O
the O
bailiff's O
clerk, O
passing O
along O
the O
highroad O
bare-headed O
and O
in O
list O
slippers, O
stopped O
to O
listen, O
his O
sheet O
of O
paper O
in O
his O
hand. O
Emma, O
on O
the O
other O
hand, O
knew O
how O
to O
look O
after O
her O
house. O
She O
sent O
the O
patients' O
accounts O
in O
well-phrased O
letters O
that O
had O
no O
suggestion O
of O
a O
bill. O
When O
they O
had O
a O
neighbour O
to O
dinner O
on O
Sundays, O
she O
managed O
to O
have O
some O
tasty O
dish-- O
piled O
up O
pyramids O
of O
greengages O
on O
vine O
leaves, O
served O
up O
preserves O
turned O
out O
into O
plates-- O
and O
even O
spoke O
of O
buying O
finger-glasses O
for O
dessert. O
From O
all O
this O
much O
consideration O
was O
extended O
to O
Bovary. O
Charles O
finished O
by O
rising O
in O
his O
own O
esteem O
for O
possessing O
such O
a O
wife. O
He O
showed O
with O
pride O
in O
the O
sitting O
room O
two O
small O
pencil O
sketched O
by O
her O
that O
he O
had O
had O
framed O
in O
very O
large O
frames, O
and O
hung O
up O
against O
the O
wallpaper O
by O
long O
green O
cords. O
People O
returning O
from O
mass O
saw O
him O
at O
his O
door O
in O
his O
wool-work O
slippers. O
He O
came O
home O
late-- O
at O
ten O
o'clock, O
at O
midnight O
sometimes. O
Then O
he O
asked O
for O
something O
to O
eat, O
and O
as O
the O
servant O
had O
gone O
to O
bed, O
Emma O
waited O
on O
him. O
He O
took O
off O
his O
coat O
to O
dine O
more O
at O
his O
ease. O
He O
told O
her, O
one O
after O
the O
other, O
the O
people O
he O
had O
met, O
the O
villages O
where O
he O
had O
been, O
the O
prescriptions O
he O
had O
written, O
and, O
well O
pleased O
with O
himself, O
he O
finished O
the O
remainder O
of O
the O
boiled O
beef O
and O
onions, O
picked O
pieces O
off O
the O
cheese, O
munched O
an O
apple, O
emptied O
his O
water-bottle, O
and O
then O
went O
to O
bed, O
and O
lay O
on O
his O
back O
and O
snored. O
As O
he O
had O
been O
for O
a O
time O
accustomed O
to O
wear O
nightcaps, O
his O
handkerchief O
would O
not O
keep O
down O
over O
his O
ears, O
so O
that O
his O
hair O
in O
the O
morning O
was O
all O
tumbled O
pell-mell O
about O
his O
face O
and O
whitened O
with O
the O
feathers O
of O
the O
pillow, O
whose O
strings O
came O
untied O
during O
the O
night. O
He O
always O
wore O
thick O
boots O
that O
had O
two O
long O
creases O
over O
the O
instep O
running O
obliquely O
towards O
the O
ankle, O
while O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
upper O
continued O
in O
a O
straight O
line O
as O
if O
stretched O
on O
a O
wooden O
foot. O
He O
said O
that O
"was O
quite O
good O
enough O
for O
the O
country." O
His O
mother O
approved O
of O
his O
economy, O
for O
she O
came O
to O
see O
him O
as O
formerly O
when O
there O
had O
been O
some O
violent O
row O
at O
her O
place; O
and O
yet O
Madame O
Bovary O
senior O
seemed O
prejudiced O
against O
her O
daughter-in-law. O
She O
thought O
"her O
ways O
too O
fine O
for O
their O
position"; O
the O
wood, O
the O
sugar, O
and O
the O
candles O
disappeared O
as O
"at O
a O
grand O
establishment," O
and O
the O
amount O
of O
firing O
in O
the O
kitchen O
would O
have O
been O
enough O
for O
twenty-five O
courses. O
She O
put O
her O
linen O
in O
order O
for O
her O
in O
the O
presses, O
and O
taught O
her O
to O
keep O
an O
eye O
on O
the O
butcher O
when O
he O
brought O
the O
meat. O
Emma O
put O
up O
with O
these O
lessons. O
Madame O
Bovary O
was O
lavish O
of O
them; O
and O
the O
words O
"daughter" O
and O
"mother" O
were O
exchanged O
all O
day O
long, O
accompanied O
by O
little O
quiverings O
of O
the O
lips, O
each O
one O
uttering O
gentle O
words O
in O
a O
voice O
trembling O
with O
anger. O
In O
Madame O
Dubuc's O
time O
the O
old O
woman O
felt O
that O
she O
was O
still O
the O
favorite; O
but O
now O
the O
love O
of O
Charles O
for O
Emma O
seemed O
to O
her O
a O
desertion O
from O
her O
tenderness, O
an O
encroachment O
upon O
what O
was O
hers, O
and O
she O
watched O
her O
son's O
happiness O
in O
sad O
silence, O
as O
a O
ruined O
man O
looks O
through O
the O
windows O
at O
people O
dining O
in O
his O
old O
house. O
She O
recalled O
to O
him O
as O
remembrances O
her O
troubles O
and O
her O
sacrifices, O
and, O
comparing O
these O
with O
Emma's O
negligence, O
came O
to O
the O
conclusion O
that O
it O
was O
not O
reasonable O
to O
adore O
her O
so O
exclusively. O
Charles O
knew O
not O
what O
to O
answer: O
he O
respected O
his O
mother, O
and O
he O
loved O
his O
wife O
infinitely; O
he O
considered O
the O
judgment O
of O
the O
one O
infallible, O
and O
yet O
he O
thought O
the O
conduct O
of O
the O
other O
irreproachable. O
When O
Madam O
Bovary O
had O
gone, O
he O
tried O
timidly O
and O
in O
the O
same O
terms O
to O
hazard O
one O
or O
two O
of O
the O
more O
anodyne O
observations O
he O
had O
heard O
from O
his O
mamma. O
Emma O
proved O
to O
him O
with O
a O
word O
that O
he O
was O
mistaken, O
and O
sent O
him O
off O
to O
his O
patients. O
And O
yet, O
in O
accord O
with O
theories O
she O
believed O
right, O
she O
wanted O
to O
make O
herself O
in O
love O
with O
him. O
By O
moonlight O
in O
the O
garden O
she O
recited O
all O
the O
passionate O
rhymes O
she O
knew O
by O
heart, O
and, O
sighing, O
sang O
to O
him O
many O
melancholy O
adagios; O
but O
she O
found O
herself O
as O
calm O
after O
as O
before, O
and O
Charles O
seemed O
no O
more O
amorous O
and O
no O
more O
moved. O
When O
she O
had O
thus O
for O
a O
while O
struck O
the O
flint O
on O
her O
heart O
without O
getting O
a O
spark, O
incapable, O
moreover, O
of O
understanding O
what O
she O
did O
not O
experience O
as O
of O
believing O
anything O
that O
did O
not O
present O
itself O
in O
conventional O
forms, O
she O
persuaded O
herself O
without O
difficulty O
that O
Charles's O
passion O
was O
nothing O
very O
exorbitant. O
His O
outbursts O
became O
regular; O
he O
embraced O
her O
at O
certain O
fixed O
times. O
It O
was O
one O
habit O
among O
other O
habits, O
and, O
like O
a O
dessert, O
looked O
forward O
to O
after O
the O
monotony O
of O
dinner. O
A O
gamekeeper, O
cured O
by O
the O
doctor O
of O
inflammation O
of O
the O
lungs, O
had O
given O
madame O
a O
little O
Italian O
greyhound; O
she O
took O
her O
out O
walking, O
for O
she O
went O
out O
sometimes O
in O
order O
to O
be O
alone O
for O
a O
moment, O
and O
not O
to O
see O
before O
her O
eyes O
the O
eternal O
garden O
and O
the O
dusty O
road. O
She O
went O
as O
far O
as O
the O
beeches O
of O
Banneville, O
near O
the O
deserted O
pavilion O
which O
forms O
an O
angle O
of O
the O
wall O
on O
the O
side O
of O
the O
country. O
Amidst O
the O
vegetation O
of O
the O
ditch O
there O
are O
long O
reeds O
with O
leaves O
that O
cut O
you. O
She O
began O
by O
looking O
round O
her O
to O
see O
if O
nothing O
had O
changed O
since O
last O
she O
had O
been O
there. O
She O
found O
again O
in O
the O
same O
places O
the O
foxgloves O
and O
wallflowers, O
the O
beds O
of O
nettles O
growing O
round O
the O
big O
stones, O
and O
the O
patches O
of O
lichen O
along O
the O
three O
windows, O
whose O
shutters, O
always O
closed, O
were O
rotting O
away O
on O
their O
rusty O
iron O
bars. O
Her O
thoughts, O
aimless O
at O
first, O
wandered O
at O
random, O
like O
her O
greyhound, O
who O
ran O
round O
and O
round O
in O
the O
fields, O
yelping O
after O
the O
yellow O
butterflies, O
chasing O
the O
shrew-mice, O
or O
nibbling O
the O
poppies O
on O
the O
edge O
of O
a O
cornfield. O
Then O
gradually O
her O
ideas O
took O
definite O
shape, O
and, O
sitting O
on O
the O
grass O
that O
she O
dug O
up O
with O
little O
prods O
of O
her O
sunshade, O
Emma O
repeated O
to O
herself, O
"Good O
heavens! O
Why O
did O
I O
marry?" O
She O
asked O
herself O
if O
by O
some O
other O
chance O
combination O
it O
would O
have O
not O
been O
possible O
to O
meet O
another O
man; O
and O
she O
tried O
to O
imagine O
what O
would O
have O
been O
these O
unrealised O
events, O
this O
different O
life, O
this O
unknown O
husband. O
All, O
surely, O
could O
not O
be O
like O
this O
one. O
He O
might O
have O
been O
handsome, O
witty, O
distinguished, O
attractive, O
such O
as, O
no O
doubt, O
her O
old O
companions O
of O
the O
convent O
had O
married. O
What O
were O
they O
doing O
now? O
In O
town, O
with O
the O
noise O
of O
the O
streets, O
the O
buzz O
of O
the O
theatres O
and O
the O
lights O
of O
the O
ballroom, O
they O
were O
living O
lives O
where O
the O
heart O
expands, O
the O
senses O
bourgeon O
out. O
But O
she-- O
her O
life O
was O
cold O
as O
a O
garret O
whose O
dormer O
window O
looks O
on O
the O
north, O
and O
ennui, O
the O
silent O
spider, O
was O
weaving O
its O
web O
in O
the O
darkness O
in O
every O
corner O
of O
her O
heart. O
She O
recalled O
the O
prize O
days, O
when O
she O
mounted O
the O
platform O
to O
receive O
her O
little O
crowns, O
with O
her O
hair O
in O
long O
plaits. O
In O
her O
white O
frock O
and O
open O
prunella O
shoes O
she O
had O
a O
pretty O
way, O
and O
when O
she O
went O
back O
to O
her O
seat, O
the O
gentlemen O
bent O
over O
her O
to O
congratulate O
her; O
the O
courtyard O
was O
full O
of O
carriages; O
farewells O
were O
called O
to O
her O
through O
their O
windows; O
the O
music O
master O
with O
his O
violin O
case O
bowed O
in O
passing O
by. O
How O
far O
all O
of O
this! O
How O
far O
away! O
She O
called O
Djali, O
took O
her O
between O
her O
knees, O
and O
smoothed O
the O
long O
delicate O
head, O
saying, O
"Come, O
kiss O
mistress; O
you O
have O
no O
troubles." O
Then O
noting O
the O
melancholy O
face O
of O
the O
graceful O
animal, O
who O
yawned O
slowly, O
she O
softened, O
and O
comparing O
her O
to O
herself, O
spoke O
to O
her O
aloud O
as O
to O
somebody O
in O
trouble O
whom O
one O
is O
consoling. O
Occasionally O
there O
came O
gusts O
of O
winds, O
breezes O
from O
the O
sea O
rolling O
in O
one O
sweep O
over O
the O
whole O
plateau O
of O
the O
Caux O
country, O
which O
brought O
even O
to O
these O
fields O
a O
salt O
freshness. O
The O
rushes, O
close O
to O
the O
ground, O
whistled; O
the O
branches O
trembled O
in O
a O
swift O
rustling, O
while O
their O
summits, O
ceaselessly O
swaying, O
kept O
up O
a O
deep O
murmur. O
Emma O
drew O
her O
shawl O
round O
her O
shoulders O
and O
rose. O
In O
the O
avenue O
a O
green O
light O
dimmed O
by O
the O
leaves O
lit O
up O
the O
short O
moss O
that O
crackled O
softly O
beneath O
her O
feet. O
The O
sun O
was O
setting; O
the O
sky O
showed O
red O
between O
the O
branches, O
and O
the O
trunks O
of O
the O
trees, O
uniform, O
and O
planted O
in O
a O
straight O
line, O
seemed O
a O
brown O
colonnade O
standing O
out O
against O
a O
background O
of O
gold. O
A O
fear O
took O
hold O
of O
her; O
she O
called O
Djali, O
and O
hurriedly O
returned O
to O
Tostes O
by O
the O
high O
road, O
threw O
herself O
into O
an O
armchair, O
and O
for O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
evening O
did O
not O
speak. O
But O
towards O
the O
end O
of O
September O
something O
extraordinary O
fell O
upon O
her O
life; O
she O
was O
invited O
by O
the O
Marquis O
d'Andervilliers O
to O
Vaubyessard. O
Secretary O
of O
State O
under O
the O
Restoration, O
the O
Marquis, O
anxious O
to O
re-enter O
political O
life, O
set O
about O
preparing O
for O
his O
candidature O
to O
the O
Chamber O
of O
Deputies O
long O
beforehand. O
In O
the O
winter O
he O
distributed O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
wood, O
and O
in O
the O
Conseil O
General O
always O
enthusiastically O
demanded O
new O
roads O
for O
his O
arrondissement. O
During O
the O
dog-days O
he O
had O
suffered O
from O
an O
abscess, O
which O
Charles O
had O
cured O
as O
if O
by O
miracle O
by O
giving O
a O
timely O
little O
touch O
with O
the O
lancet. O
The O
steward O
sent O
to O
Tostes O
to O
pay O
for O
the O
operation O
reported O
in O
the O
evening O
that O
he O
had O
seen O
some O
superb O
cherries O
in O
the O
doctor's O
little O
garden. O
Now O
cherry O
trees O
did O
not O
thrive O
at O
Vaubyessard; O
the O
Marquis O
asked O
Bovary O
for O
some O
slips; O
made O
it O
his O
business O
to O
thank O
his O
personally; O
saw O
Emma; O
thought O
she O
had O
a O
pretty O
figure, O
and O
that O
she O
did O
not O
bow O
like O
a O
peasant; O
so O
that O
he O
did O
not O
think O
he O
was O
going O
beyond O
the O
bounds O
of O
condescension, O
nor, O
on O
the O
other O
hand, O
making O
a O
mistake, O
in O
inviting O
the O
young O
couple. O
On O
Wednesday O
at O
three O
o'clock, O
Monsieur O
and O
Madame O
Bovary, O
seated O
in O
their O
dog-cart, O
set O
out O
for O
Vaubyessard, O
with O
a O
great O
trunk O
strapped O
on O
behind O
and O
a O
bonnet-box O
in O
front O
of O
the O
apron. O
Besides O
these O
Charles O
held O
a O
bandbox O
between O
his O
knees. O
They O
arrived O
at O
nightfall, O
just O
as O
the O
lamps O
in O
the O
park O
were O
being O
lit O
to O
show O
the O
way O
for O
the O
carriages. O
CHAPTER O
EIGHT O
The O
chateau, O
a O
modern O
building O
in O
Italian O
style, O
with O
two O
projecting O
wings O
and O
three O
flights O
of O
steps, O
lay O
at O
the O
foot O
of O
an O
immense O
green-sward, O
on O
which O
some O
cows O
were O
grazing O
among O
groups O
of O
large O
trees O
set O
out O
at O
regular O
intervals, O
while O
large O
beds O
of O
arbutus, O
rhododendron, O
syringas, O
and O
guelder O
roses O
bulged O
out O
their O
irregular O
clusters O
of O
green O
along O
the O
curve O
of O
the O
gravel O
path. O
A O
river O
flowed O
under O
a O
bridge; O
through O
the O
mist O
one O
could O
distinguish O
buildings O
with O
thatched O
roofs O
scattered O
over O
the O
field O
bordered O
by O
two O
gently O
sloping, O
well O
timbered O
hillocks, O
and O
in O
the O
background O
amid O
the O
trees O
rose O
in O
two O
parallel O
lines O
the O
coach O
houses O
and O
stables, O
all O
that O
was O
left O
of O
the O
ruined O
old O
chateau. O
Charles's O
dog-cart O
pulled O
up O
before O
the O
middle O
flight O
of O
steps; O
servants O
appeared; O
the O
Marquis O
came O
forward, O
and, O
offering O
his O
arm O
to O
the O
doctor's O
wife, O
conducted O
her O
to O
the O
vestibule. O
It O
was O
paved O
with O
marble O
slabs, O
was O
very O
lofty, O
and O
the O
sound O
of O
footsteps O
and O
that O
of O
voices O
re-echoed O
through O
it O
as O
in O
a O
church. O
Opposite O
rose O
a O
straight O
staircase, O
and O
on O
the O
left O
a O
gallery O
overlooking O
the O
garden O
led O
to O
the O
billiard O
room, O
through O
whose O
door O
one O
could O
hear O
the O
click O
of O
the O
ivory O
balls. O
As O
she O
crossed O
it O
to O
go O
to O
the O
drawing O
room, O
Emma O
saw O
standing O
round O
the O
table O
men O
with O
grave O
faces, O
their O
chins O
resting O
on O
high O
cravats. O
They O
all O
wore O
orders, O
and O
smiled O
silently O
as O
they O
made O
their O
strokes. O
On O
the O
dark O
wainscoting O
of O
the O
walls O
large O
gold O
frames O
bore O
at O
the O
bottom O
names O
written O
in O
black O
letters. O
She O
read: O
"Jean-Antoine O
d'Andervilliers O
d'Yvervonbille, O
Count O
de O
la O
Vaubyessard O
and O
Baron O
de O
la O
Fresnay, O
killed O
at O
the O
battle O
of O
Coutras O
onDONEDET193320th O
of O
October, O
1587." O
And O
on O
another: O
"Jean-Antoine-Henry-Guy O
d'Andervilliers O
de O
la O
Vaubyessard, O
Admiral O
of O
France O
and O
Chevalier O
of O
the O
Order O
of O
St. O
Michael, O
wounded O
at O
the O

of O
the O

of O
May, O
1692; O
died O
at O
Vaubyessard O
onDONEDET193823rd O
of O
January O
1693." O
One O
could O
hardly O
make O
out O
those O
that O
followed, O
for O
the O
light O
of O
the O
lamps O
lowered O
over O
the O
green O
cloth O
threw O
a O
dim O
shadow O
round O
the O
room. O
Burnishing O
the O
horizontal O
pictures, O
it O
broke O
up O
against O
these O
in O
delicate O
lines O
where O
there O
were O
cracks O
in O
the O
varnish, O
and O
from O
all O
these O
great O
black O
squares O
framed O
in O
with O
gold O
stood O
out O
here O
and O
there O
some O
lighter O
portion O
of O
the O
painting O
-- O
a O
pale O
brow, O
two O
eyes O
that O
looked O
at O
you, O
perukes O
flowing O
over O
and O
powdering O
red-coated O
shoulders, O
or O
the O
buckle O
of O
a O
garter O
above O
a O
well-rounded O
calf. O
The O
Marquis O
opened O
the O
drawing O
room O
door; O
one O
of O
the O
ladies O
(the O
Marchioness O
herself) O
came O
to O
meet O
Emma. O
She O
made O
her O
sit O
down O
by O
her O
on O
an O
ottoman, O
and O
began O
talking O
to O
her O
as O
amicably O
as O
if O
she O
had O
known O
her O
a O
long O
time. O
She O
was O
a O
woman O
of O
about O
forty, O
with O
fine O
shoulders, O
a O
hook O
nose, O
a O
drawling O
voice, O
and O
on O
this O
evening O
she O
wore O
over O
her O
brown O
hair O
a O
simple O
guipure O
fichu O
that O
fell O
in O
a O
point O
at O
the O
back. O
A O
fair O
young O
woman O
sat O
in O
a O
high-backed O
chair O
in O
a O
corner; O
and O
gentlemen O
with O
flowers O
in O
their O
buttonholes O
were O
talking O
to O
ladies O
round O
the O
fire. O
At O
seven O
dinner O
was O
served. O
The O
men, O
who O
were O
in O
the O
majority, O
sat O
down O
at O
the O
first O
table O
in O
the O
vestibule; O
the O
ladies O
at O
the O
second O
in O
the O
dining O
room O
with O
the O
Marquis O
and O
Marchioness. O
Emma, O
on O
entering, O
felt O
herself O
wrapped O
round O
by O
the O
warm O
air, O
a O
blending O
of O
the O
perfume O
of O
flowers O
and O
of O
the O
fine O
linen, O
of O
the O
fumes O
of O
the O
viands, O
and O
the O
odour O
of O
the O
truffles. O
The O
silver O
dish O
covers O
reflected O
the O
lighted O
wax O
candles O
in O
the O
candelabra, O
the O
cut O
crystal O
covered O
with O
light O
steam O
reflected O
from O
one O
to O
the O
other O
pale O
rays; O
bouquets O
were O
placed O
in O
a O
row O
the O
whole O
length O
of O
the O
table; O
and O
in O
the O
large-bordered O
plates O
each O
napkin, O
arranged O
after O
the O
fashion O
of O
a O
bishop's O
mitre, O
held O
between O
its O
two O
gaping O
folds O
a O
small O
oval O
shaped O
roll. O
The O
red O
claws O
of O
lobsters O
hung O
over O
the O
dishes; O
rich O
fruit O
in O
open O
baskets O
was O
piled O
up O
on O
moss; O
there O
were O
quails O
in O
their O
plumage; O
smoke O
was O
rising; O
and O
in O
silk O
stockings, O
knee-breeches, O
white O
cravat, O
and O
frilled O
shirt, O
the O
steward, O
grave O
as O
a O
judge, O
offering O
ready O
carved O
dishes O
between O
the O
shoulders O
of O
the O
guests, O
with O
a O
touch O
of O
the O
spoon O
gave O
you O
the O
piece O
chosen. O
On O
the O
large O
stove O
of O
porcelain O
inlaid O
with O
copper O
baguettes O
the O
statue O
of O
a O
woman, O
draped O
to O
the O
chin, O
gazed O
motionless O
on O
the O
room O
full O
of O
life. O
Madame O
Bovary O
noticed O
that O
many O
ladies O
had O
not O
put O
their O
gloves O
in O
their O
glasses. O
But O
at O
the O
upper O
end O
of O
the O
table, O
alone O
amongst O
all O
these O
women, O
bent O
over O
his O
full O
plate, O
and O
his O
napkin O
tied O
round O
his O
neck O
like O
a O
child, O
an O
old O
man O
sat O
eating, O
letting O
drops O
of O
gravy O
drip O
from O
his O
mouth. O
His O
eyes O
were O
bloodshot, O
and O
he O
wore O
a O
little O
queue O
tied O
with O
black O
ribbon. O
He O
was O
the O
Marquis's O
father-in-law, O
the O
old O
Duke O
de O
Laverdiere, O
once O
on O
a O
time O
favourite O
of O
the O
Count O
d'Artois, O
in O
the O
days O
of O
the O
Vaudreuil O
hunting-parties O
at O
the O
Marquis O
de O
Conflans', O
and O
had O
been, O
it O
was O
said, O
the O
lover O
of O
Queen O
Marie O
Antoinette, O
between O
Monsieur O
de O
Coigny O
and O
Monsieur O
de O
Lauzun. O
He O
had O
lived O
a O
life O
of O
noisy O
debauch, O
full O
of O
duels, O
bets, O
elopements; O
he O
had O
squandered O
his O
fortune O
and O
frightened O
all O
his O
family. O
A O
servant O
behind O
his O
chair O
named O
aloud O
to O
him O
in O
his O
ear O
the O
dishes O
that O
he O
pointed O
to O
stammering, O
and O
constantly O
Emma's O
eyes O
turned O
involuntarily O
to O
this O
old O
man O
with O
hanging O
lips, O
as O
to O
something O
extraordinary. O
He O
had O
lived O
at O
court O
and O
slept O
in O
the O
bed O
of O
queens! O
Iced O
champagne O
was O
poured O
out. O
Emma O
shivered O
all O
over O
as O
she O
felt O
it O
cold O
in O
her O
mouth. O
She O
had O
never O
seen O
pomegranates O
nor O
tasted O
pineapples. O
The O
powdered O
sugar O
even O
seemed O
to O
her O
whiter O
and O
finer O
than O
elsewhere. O
The O
ladies O
afterwards O
went O
to O
their O
rooms O
to O
prepare O
for O
the O
ball. O
Emma O
made O
her O
toilet O
with O
the O
fastidious O
care O
of O
an O
actress O
on O
her O
debut. O
She O
did O
her O
hair O
according O
to O
the O
directions O
of O
the O
hairdresser, O
and O
put O
on O
the O
barege O
dress O
spread O
out O
upon O
the O
bed. O
Charles's O
trousers O
were O
tight O
across O
the O
belly. O
"My O
trouser-straps O
will O
be O
rather O
awkward O
for O
dancing," O
he O
said. O
"Dancing?" O
repeated O
Emma. O
"Yes!" O
"Why, O
you O
must O
be O
mad! O
They O
would O
make O
fun O
of O
you; O
keep O
your O
place. O
Besides, O
it O
is O
more O
becoming O
for O
a O
doctor," O
she O
added. O
Charles O
was O
silent. O
He O
walked O
up O
and O
down O
waiting O
for O
Emma O
to O
finish O
dressing. O
He O
saw O
her O
from O
behind O
in O
the O
glass O
between O
two O
lights. O
Her O
black O
eyes O
seemed O
blacker O
than O
ever. O
Her O
hair, O
undulating O
towards O
the O
ears, O
shone O
with O
a O
blue O
lustre; O
a O
rose O
in O
her O
chignon O
trembled O
on O
its O
mobile O
stalk, O
with O
artificial O
dewdrops O
on O
the O
tip O
of O
the O
leaves. O
She O
wore O
a O
gown O
of O
pale O
saffron O
trimmed O
with O
three O
bouquets O
of O
pompon O
roses O
mixed O
with O
green. O
Charles O
came O
and O
kissed O
her O
on O
her O
shoulder. O
"Let O
me O
alone!" O
she O
said; O
"you O
are O
tumbling O
me." O
One O
could O
hear O
the O
flourish O
of O
the O
violin O
and O
the O
notes O
of O
a O
horn. O
She O
went O
downstairs O
restraining O
herself O
from O
running. O
Dancing O
had O
begun. O
Guests O
were O
arriving. O
There O
was O
some O
crushing. O
She O
sat O
down O
on O
a O
form O
near O
the O
door. O
The O
quadrille O
over, O
the O
floor O
was O
occupied O
by O
groups O
of O
men O
standing O
up O
and O
talking O
and O
servants O
in O
livery O
bearing O
large O
trays. O
Along O
the O
line O
of O
seated O
women O
painted O
fans O
were O
fluttering, O
bouquets O
half O
hid O
smiling O
faces, O
and O
gold O
stoppered O
scent-bottles O
were O
turned O
in O
partly-closed O
hands, O
whose O
white O
gloves O
outlined O
the O
nails O
and O
tightened O
on O
the O
flesh O
at O
the O
wrists. O
Lace O
trimmings, O
diamond O
brooches, O
medallion O
bracelets O
trembled O
on O
bodices, O
gleamed O
on O
breasts, O
clinked O
on O
bare O
arms. O
The O
hair, O
well-smoothed O
over O
the O
temples O
and O
knotted O
at O
the O
nape, O
bore O
crowns, O
or O
bunches, O
or O
sprays O
of O
mytosotis, O
jasmine, O
pomegranate O
blossoms, O
ears O
of O
corn, O
and O
corn-flowers. O
Calmly O
seated O
in O
their O
places, O
mothers O
with O
forbidding O
countenances O
were O
wearing O
red O
turbans. O
Emma's O
heart O
beat O
rather O
faster O
when, O
her O
partner O
holding O
her O
by O
the O
tips O
of O
the O
fingers, O
she O
took O
her O
place O
in O
a O
line O
with O
the O
dancers, O
and O
waited O
for O
the O
first O
note O
to O
start. O
But O
her O
emotion O
soon O
vanished, O
and, O
swaying O
to O
the O
rhythm O
of O
the O
orchestra, O
she O
glided O
forward O
with O
slight O
movements O
of O
the O
neck. O
A O
smile O
rose O
to O
her O
lips O
at O
certain O
delicate O
phrases O
of O
the O
violin, O
that O
sometimes O
played O
alone O
while O
the O
other O
instruments O
were O
silent; O
one O
could O
hear O
the O
clear O
clink O
of O
the O
louis O
d'or O
that O
were O
being O
thrown O
down O
upon O
the O
card O
tables O
in O
the O
next O
room; O
then O
all O
struck O
again, O
the O
cornet-a-piston O
uttered O
its O
sonorous O
note, O
feet O
marked O
time, O
skirts O
swelled O
and O
rustled, O
hands O
touched O
and O
parted; O
the O
same O
eyes O
falling O
before O
you O
met O
yours O
again. O
A O
few O
men O
(some O
fifteen O
or O
so), O
of O
twenty-five O
to O
forty, O
scattered O
here O
and O
there O
among O
the O
dancers O
or O
talking O
at O
the O
doorways, O
distinguished O
themselves O
from O
the O
crowd O
by O
a O
certain O
air O
of O
breeding, O
whatever O
their O
differences O
in O
age, O
dress, O
or O
face. O
Their O
clothes, O
better O
made, O
seemed O
of O
finer O
cloth, O
and O
their O
hair, O
brought O
forward O
in O
curls O
towards O
the O
temples, O
glossy O
with O
more O
delicate O
pomades. O
They O
had O
the O
complexion O
of O
wealth-- O
that O
clear O
complexion O
that O
is O
heightened O
by O
the O
pallor O
of O
porcelain, O
the O
shimmer O
of O
satin, O
the O
veneer O
of O
old O
furniture, O
and O
that O
an O
ordered O
regimen O
of O
exquisite O
nurture O
maintains O
at O
its O
best. O
Their O
necks O
moved O
easily O
in O
their O
low O
cravats, O
their O
long O
whiskers O
fell O
over O
their O
turned-down O
collars, O
they O
wiped O
their O
lips O
upon O
handkerchiefs O
with O
embroidered O
initials O
that O
gave O
forth O
a O
subtle O
perfume. O
Those O
who O
were O
beginning O
to O
grow O
old O
had O
an O
air O
of O
youth, O
while O
there O
was O
something O
mature O
in O
the O
faces O
of O
the O
young. O
In O
their O
unconcerned O
looks O
was O
the O
calm O
of O
passions O
daily O
satiated, O
and O
through O
all O
their O
gentleness O
of O
manner O
pierced O
that O
peculiar O
brutality, O
the O
result O
of O
a O
command O
of O
half-easy O
things, O
in O
which O
force O
is O
exercised O
and O
vanity O
amused-- O
the O
management O
of O
thoroughbred O
horses O
and O
the O
society O
of O
loose O
women. O
A O
few O
steps O
from O
Emma O
a O
gentleman O
in O
a O
blue O
coat O
was O
talking O
of O
Italy O
with O
a O
pale O
young O
woman O
wearing O
a O
parure O
of O
pearls. O
They O
were O
praising O
the O
breadth O
of O
the O
columns O
of O
St. O
Peter's, O
Tivoly, O
Vesuvius, O
Castellamare, O
and O
Cassines, O
the O
roses O
of O
Genoa, O
the O
Coliseum O
by O
moonlight. O
With O
her O
other O
ear O
Emma O
was O
listening O
to O
a O
conversation O
full O
of O
words O
she O
did O
not O
understand. O
A O
circle O
gathered O
round O
a O
very O
young O
man O
who O
the O
week O
before O
had O
beaten O
"Miss O
Arabella" O
and O
"Romolus," O
and O
won O
two O
thousand O
louis O
jumping O
a O
ditch O
in O
England. O
One O
complained O
that O
his O
racehorses O
were O
growing O
fat; O
another O
of O
the O
printers' O
errors O
that O
had O
disfigured O
the O
name O
of O
his O
horse. O
The O
atmosphere O
of O
the O
ball O
was O
heavy; O
the O
lamps O
were O
growing O
dim. O
Guests O
were O
flocking O
to O
the O
billiard O
room. O
A O
servant O
got O
upon O
a O
chair O
and O
broke O
the O
window-panes. O
At O
the O
crash O
of O
the O
glass O
Madame O
Bovary O
turned O
her O
head O
and O
saw O
in O
the O
garden O
the O
faces O
of O
peasants O
pressed O
against O
the O
window O
looking O
in O
at O
them. O
Then O
the O
memory O
of O
the O
Bertaux O
came O
back O
to O
her. O
She O
saw O
the O
farm O
again, O
the O
muddy O
pond, O
her O
father O
in O
a O
blouse O
under O
the O
apple O
trees, O
and O
she O
saw O
herself O
again O
as O
formerly, O
skimming O
with O
her O
finger O
the O
cream O
off O
the O
milk-pans O
in O
the O
dairy. O
But O
in O
the O
refulgence O
of O
the O
present O
hour O
her O
past O
life, O
so O
distinct O
until O
then, O
faded O
away O
completely, O
and O
she O
almost O
doubted O
having O
lived O
it. O
She O
was O
there; O
beyond O
the O
ball O
was O
only O
shadow O
overspreading O
all O
the O
rest. O
She O
was O
just O
eating O
a O
maraschino O
ice O
that O
she O
held O
with O
her O
left O
hand O
in O
a O
silver-gilt O
cup, O
her O
eyes O
half-closed, O
and O
the O
spoon O
between O
her O
teeth. O
A O
lady O
near O
her O
dropped O
her O
fan. O
A O
gentlemen O
was O
passing. O
"Would O
you O
be O
so O
good," O
said O
the O
lady, O
"as O
to O
pick O
up O
my O
fan O
that O
has O
fallen O
behind O
the O
sofa?" O
The O
gentleman O
bowed, O
and O
as O
he O
moved O
to O
stretch O
out O
his O
arm, O
Emma O
saw O
the O
hand O
of O
a O
young O
woman O
throw O
something O
white, O
folded O
in O
a O
triangle, O
into O
his O
hat. O
The O
gentleman, O
picking O
up O
the O
fan, O
offered O
it O
to O
the O
lady O
respectfully; O
she O
thanked O
him O
with O
an O
inclination O
of O
the O
head, O
and O
began O
smelling O
her O
bouquet. O
After O
supper, O
where O
were O
plenty O
of O
Spanish O
and O
Rhine O
wines, O
soups O
a O
la O
bisque O
and O
au O
lait O
d'amandes, O
puddings O
a O
la O
Trafalgar, O
and O
all O
sorts O
of O
cold O
meats O
with O
jellies O
that O
trembled O
in O
the O
dishes, O
the O
carriages O
one O
after O
the O
other O
began O
to O
drive O
off. O
Raising O
the O
corners O
of O
the O
muslin O
curtain, O
one O
could O
see O
the O
light O
of O
their O
lanterns O
glimmering O
through O
the O
darkness. O
The O
seats O
began O
to O
empty, O
some O
card-players O
were O
still O
left; O
the O
musicians O
were O
cooling O
the O
tips O
of O
their O
fingers O
on O
their O
tongues. O
Charles O
was O
half O
asleep, O
his O
back O
propped O
against O
a O
door. O
WITH O
ALMOND O
MILK O
At O
three O
o'clock O
the O
cotillion O
began. O
Emma O
did O
not O
know O
how O
to O
waltz. O
Everyone O
was O
waltzing, O
Mademoiselle O
d'Andervilliers O
herself O
and O
the O
Marquis; O
only O
the O
guests O
staying O
at O
the O
castle O
were O
still O
there, O
about O
a O
dozen O
persons. O
One O
of O
the O
waltzers, O
however, O
who O
was O
familiarly O
called O
Viscount, O
and O
whose O
low O
cut O
waistcoat O
seemed O
moulded O
to O
his O
chest, O
came O
a O
second O
time O
to O
ask O
Madame O
Bovary O
to O
dance, O
assuring O
her O
that O
he O
would O
guide O
her, O
and O
that O
she O
would O
get O
through O
it O
very O
well. O
They O
began O
slowly, O
then O
went O
more O
rapidly. O
They O
turned; O
all O
around O
them O
was O
turning-- O
the O
lamps, O
the O
furniture, O
the O
wainscoting, O
the O
floor, O
like O
a O
disc O
on O
a O
pivot. O
On O
passing O
near O
the O
doors O
the O
bottom O
of O
Emma's O
dress O
caught O
against O
his O
trousers. O
Their O
legs O
commingled; O
he O
looked O
down O
at O
her; O
she O
raised O
her O
eyes O
to O
his. O
A O
torpor O
seized O
her; O
she O
stopped. O
They O
started O
again, O
and O
with O
a O
more O
rapid O
movement; O
the O
Viscount, O
dragging O
her O
along O
disappeared O
with O
her O
to O
the O
end O
of O
the O
gallery, O
where O
panting, O
she O
almost O
fell, O
and O
for O
a O
moment O
rested O
her O
head O
upon O
his O
breast. O
And O
then, O
still O
turning, O
but O
more O
slowly, O
he O
guided O
her O
back O
to O
her O
seat. O
She O
leaned O
back O
against O
the O
wall O
and O
covered O
her O
eyes O
with O
her O
hands. O
When O
she O
opened O
them O
again, O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
drawing O
room O
three O
waltzers O
were O
kneeling O
before O
a O
lady O
sitting O
on O
a O
stool. O
She O
chose O
the O
Viscount, O
and O
the O
violin O
struck O
up O
once O
more. O
Everyone O
looked O
at O
them. O
They O
passed O
and O
re-passed, O
she O
with O
rigid O
body, O
her O
chin O
bent O
down, O
and O
he O
always O
in O
the O
same O
pose, O
his O
figure O
curved, O
his O
elbow O
rounded, O
his O
chin O
thrown O
forward. O
That O
woman O
knew O
how O
to O
waltz! O
They O
kept O
up O
a O
long O
time, O
and O
tired O
out O
all O
the O
others. O
Then O
they O
talked O
a O
few O
moments O
longer, O
and O
after O
the O
goodnights, O
or O
rather O
good O
mornings, O
the O
guests O
of O
the O
chateau O
retired O
to O
bed. O
Charles O
dragged O
himself O
up O
by O
the O
balusters. O
His O
"knees O
were O
going O
up O
into O
his O
body." O
He O
had O
spent O
five O
consecutive O
hours O
standing O
bolt O
upright O
at O
the O
card O
tables, O
watching O
them O
play O
whist, O
without O
understanding O
anything O
about O
it, O
and O
it O
was O
with O
a O
deep O
sigh O
of O
relief O
that O
he O
pulled O
off O
his O
boots. O
Emma O
threw O
a O
shawl O
over O
her O
shoulders, O
opened O
the O
window, O
and O
leant O
out. O
The O
night O
was O
dark; O
some O
drops O
of O
rain O
were O
falling. O
She O
breathed O
in O
the O
damp O
wind O
that O
refreshed O
her O
eyelids. O
The O
music O
of O
the O
ball O
was O
still O
murmuring O
in O
her O
ears. O
And O
she O
tried O
to O
keep O
herself O
awake O
in O
order O
to O
prolong O
the O
illusion O
of O
this O
luxurious O
life O
that O
she O
would O
soon O
have O
to O
give O
up. O
Day O
began O
to O
break. O
She O
looked O
long O
at O
the O
windows O
of O
the O
chateau, O
trying O
to O
guess O
which O
were O
the O
rooms O
of O
all O
those O
she O
had O
noticed O
the O
evening O
before. O
She O
would O
fain O
have O
known O
their O
lives, O
have O
penetrated, O
blended O
with O
them. O
But O
she O
was O
shivering O
with O
cold. O
She O
undressed, O
and O
cowered O
down O
between O
the O
sheets O
against O
Charles, O
who O
was O
asleep. O
There O
were O
a O
great O
many O
people O
to O
luncheon. O
The O
repast O
lasted O
ten O
minutes; O
no O
liqueurs O
were O
served, O
which O
astonished O
the O
doctor. O
Next, O
Mademoiselle O
d'Andervilliers O
collected O
some O
pieces O
of O
roll O
in O
a O
small O
basket O
to O
take O
them O
to O
the O
swans O
on O
the O
ornamental O
waters, O
and O
they O
went O
to O
walk O
in O
the O
hot-houses, O
where O
strange O
plants, O
bristling O
with O
hairs, O
rose O
in O
pyramids O
under O
hanging O
vases, O
whence, O
as O
from O
over-filled O
nests O
of O
serpents, O
fell O
long O
green O
cords O
interlacing. O
The O
orangery, O
which O
was O
at O
the O
other O
end, O
led O
by O
a O
covered O
way O
to O
the O
outhouses O
of O
the O
chateau. O
The O
Marquis, O
to O
amuse O
the O
young O
woman, O
took O
her O
to O
see O
the O
stables. O
Above O
the O
basket-shaped O
racks O
porcelain O
slabs O
bore O
the O
names O
of O
the O
horses O
in O
black O
letters. O
Each O
animal O
in O
its O
stall O
whisked O
its O
tail O
when O
anyone O
went O
near O
and O
said O
"Tchk! O
tchk!" O
The O
boards O
of O
the O
harness O
room O
shone O
like O
the O
flooring O
of O
a O
drawing O
room. O
The O
carriage O
harness O
was O
piled O
up O
in O
the O
middle O
against O
two O
twisted O
columns, O
and O
the O
bits, O
the O
whips, O
the O
spurs, O
the O
curbs, O
were O
ranged O
in O
a O
line O
all O
along O
the O
wall. O
Charles, O
meanwhile, O
went O
to O
ask O
a O
groom O
to O
put O
his O
horse O
to. O
The O
dog-cart O
was O
brought O
to O
the O
foot O
of O
the O
steps, O
and, O
all O
the O
parcels O
being O
crammed O
in, O
the O
Bovarys O
paid O
their O
respects O
to O
the O
Marquis O
and O
Marchioness O
and O
set O
out O
again O
for O
Tostes. O
Emma O
watched O
the O
turning O
wheels O
in O
silence. O
Charles, O
on O
the O
extreme O
edge O
of O
the O
seat, O
held O
the O
reins O
with O
his O
two O
arms O
wide O
apart, O
and O
the O
little O
horse O
ambled O
along O
in O
the O
shafts O
that O
were O
too O
big O
for O
him. O
The O
loose O
reins O
hanging O
over O
his O
crupper O
were O
wet O
with O
foam, O
and O
the O
box O
fastened O
on O
behind O
the O
chaise O
gave O
great O
regular O
bumps O
against O
it. O
They O
were O
on O
the O
heights O
of O
Thibourville O
when O
suddenly O
some O
horsemen O
with O
cigars O
between O
their O
lips O
passed O
laughing. O
Emma O
thought O
she O
recognized O
the O
Viscount, O
turned O
back, O
and O
caught O
on O
the O
horizon O
only O
the O
movement O
of O
the O
heads O
rising O
or O
falling O
with O
the O
unequal O
cadence O
of O
the O
trot O
or O
gallop. O
A O
mile O
farther O
on O
they O
had O
to O
stop O
to O
mend O
with O
some O
string O
the O
traces O
that O
had O
broken. O
But O
Charles, O
giving O
a O
last O
look O
to O
the O
harness, O
saw O
something O
on O
the O
ground O
between O
his O
horse's O
legs, O
and O
he O
picked O
up O
a O
cigar-case O
with O
a O
green O
silk O
border O
and O
beblazoned O
in O
the O
centre O
like O
the O
door O
of O
a O
carriage. O
"There O
are O
even O
two O
cigars O
in O
it," O
said O
he; O
"they'll O
do O
for O
this O
evening O
after O
dinner." O
"Why, O
do O
you O
smoke?" O
she O
asked. O
"Sometimes, O
when O
I O
get O
a O
chance." O
He O
put O
his O
find O
in O
his O
pocket O
and O
whipped O
up O
the O
nag. O
When O
they O
reached O
home O
the O
dinner O
was O
not O
ready. O
Madame O
lost O
her O
temper. O
Nastasie O
answered O
rudely. O
"Leave O
the O
room!" O
said O
Emma. O
"You O
are O
forgetting O
yourself. O
I O
give O
you O
warning." O
For O
dinner O
there O
was O
onion O
soup O
and O
a O
piece O
of O
veal O
with O
sorrel. O
Charles, O
seated O
opposite O
Emma, O
rubbed O
his O
hands O
gleefully. O
"How O
good O
it O
is O
to O
be O
at O
home O
again!" O
Nastasie O
could O
be O
heard O
crying. O
He O
was O
rather O
fond O
of O
the O
poor O
girl. O
She O
had O
formerly, O
during O
the O
wearisome O
time O
of O
his O
widowhood, O
kept O
him O
company O
many O
an O
evening. O
She O
had O
been O
his O
first O
patient, O
his O
oldest O
acquaintance O
in O
the O
place. O
"Have O
you O
given O
her O
warning O
for O
good?" O
he O
asked O
at O
last. O
"Yes. O
Who O
is O
to O
prevent O
me?" O
she O
replied. O
Then O
they O
warmed O
themselves O
in O
the O
kitchen O
while O
their O
room O
was O
being O
made O
ready. O
Charles O
began O
to O
smoke. O
He O
smoked O
with O
lips O
protruding, O
spitting O
every O
moment, O
recoiling O
at O
every O
puff. O
"You'll O
make O
yourself O
ill," O
she O
said O
scornfully. O
He O
put O
down O
his O
cigar O
and O
ran O
to O
swallow O
a O
glass O
of O
cold O
water O
at O
the O
pump. O
Emma O
seizing O
hold O
of O
the O
cigar O
case O
threw O
it O
quickly O
to O
the O
back O
of O
the O
cupboard. O
The O
next O
day O
was O
a O
long O
one. O
She O
walked O
about O
her O
little O
garden, O
up O
and O
down O
the O
same O
walks, O
stopping O
before O
the O
beds, O
before O
the O
espalier, O
before O
the O
plaster O
curate, O
looking O
with O
amazement O
at O
all O
these O
things O
of O
once-on-a-time O
that O
she O
knew O
so O
well. O
How O
far O
off O
the O
ball O
seemed O
already! O
What O
was O
it O
that O
thus O
set O
so O
far O
asunder O
the O
morning O
of O
the O
day O
before O
yesterday O
and O
the O
evening O
of O
to-day? O
Her O
journey O
to O
Vaubyessard O
had O
made O
a O
hole O
in O
her O
life, O
like O
one O
of O
those O
great O
crevices O
that O
a O
storm O
will O
sometimes O
make O
in O
one O
night O
in O
mountains. O
Still O
she O
was O
resigned. O
She O
devoutly O
put O
away O
in O
her O
drawers O
her O
beautiful O
dress, O
down O
to O
the O
satin O
shoes O
whose O
soles O
were O
yellowed O
with O
the O
slippery O
wax O
of O
the O
dancing O
floor. O
Her O
heart O
was O
like O
these. O
In O
its O
friction O
against O
wealth O
something O
had O
come O
over O
it O
that O
could O
not O
be O
effaced. O
The O
memory O
of O
this O
ball, O
then, O
became O
an O
occupation O
for O
Emma. O
Whenever O
the O
Wednesday O
came O
round O
she O
said O
to O
herself O
as O
she O
awoke, O
"Ah! O
I O
was O
there O
a O
week O
-- O
a O
fortnight-- O
three O
weeks O
ago." O
And O
little O
by O
little O
the O
faces O
grew O
confused O
in O
her O
remembrance. O
She O
forgot O
the O
tune O
of O
the O
quadrilles; O
she O
no O
longer O
saw O
the O
liveries O
and O
appointments O
so O
distinctly; O
some O
details O
escaped O
her, O
but O
the O
regret O
remained O
with O
her. O
CHAPTER O
NINE O
Often O
when O
Charles O
was O
out O
she O
took O
from O
the O
cupboard, O
between O
the O
folds O
of O
the O
linen O
where O
she O
had O
left O
it, O
the O
green O
silk O
cigar O
case. O
She O
looked O
at O
it, O
opened O
it, O
and O
even O
smelt O
the O
odour O
of O
the O
lining O
-- O
a O
mixture O
of O
verbena O
and O
tobacco. O
Whose O
was O
it? O
The O
Viscount's? O
Perhaps O
it O
was O
a O
present O
from O
his O
mistress. O
It O
had O
been O
embroidered O
on O
some O
rosewood O
frame, O
a O
pretty O
little O
thing, O
hidden O
from O
all O
eyes, O
that O
had O
occupied O
many O
hours, O
and O
over O
which O
had O
fallen O
the O
soft O
curls O
of O
the O
pensive O
worker. O
A O
breath O
of O
love O
had O
passed O
over O
the O
stitches O
on O
the O
canvas; O
each O
prick O
of O
the O
needle O
had O
fixed O
there O
a O
hope O
or O
a O
memory, O
and O
all O
those O
interwoven O
threads O
of O
silk O
were O
but O
the O
continuity O
of O
the O
same O
silent O
passion. O
And O
then O
one O
morning O
the O
Viscount O
had O
taken O
it O
away O
with O
him. O
Of O
what O
had O
they O
spoken O
when O
it O
lay O
upon O
the O
wide-mantelled O
chimneys O
between O
flower-vases O
and O
Pompadour O
clocks? O
She O
was O
at O
Tostes; O
he O
was O
at O
Paris O
now, O
far O
away! O
What O
was O
this O
Paris O
like? O
What O
a O
vague O
name! O
She O
repeated O
it O
in O
a O
low O
voice, O
for O
the O
mere O
pleasure O
of O
it; O
it O
rang O
in O
her O
ears O
like O
a O
great O
cathedral O
bell; O
it O
shone O
before O
her O
eyes, O
even O
on O
the O
labels O
of O
her O
pomade-pots. O
At O
night, O
when O
the O
carriers O
passed O
under O
her O
windows O
in O
their O
carts O
singing O
the O
"Marjolaine," O
she O
awoke, O
and O
listened O
to O
the O
noise O
of O
the O
iron-bound O
wheels, O
which, O
as O
they O
gained O
the O
country O
road, O
was O
soon O
deadened O
by O
the O
soil. O
"They O
will O
be O
there O
to-morrow!" O
she O
said O
to O
herself. O
And O
she O
followed O
them O
in O
thought O
up O
and O
down O
the O
hills, O
traversing O
villages, O
gliding O
along O
the O
highroads O
by O
the O
light O
of O
the O
stars. O
At O
the O
end O
of O
some O
indefinite O
distance O
there O
was O
always O
a O
confused O
spot, O
into O
which O
her O
dream O
died. O
She O
bought O
a O
plan O
of O
Paris, O
and O
with O
the O
tip O
of O
her O
finger O
on O
the O
map O
she O
walked O
about O
the O
capital. O
She O
went O
up O
the O
boulevards, O
stopping O
at O
every O
turning, O
between O
the O
lines O
of O
the O
streets, O
in O
front O
of O
the O
white O
squares O
that O
represented O
the O
houses. O
At O
last O
she O
would O
close O
the O
lids O
of O
her O
weary O
eyes, O
and O
see O
in O
the O
darkness O
the O
gas O
jets O
flaring O
in O
the O
wind O
and O
the O
steps O
of O
carriages O
lowered O
with O
much O
noise O
before O
the O
peristyles O
of O
theatres. O
She O
took O
in O
"La O
Corbeille," O
a O
lady's O
journal, O
and O
the O
"Sylphe O
des O
Salons." O
She O
devoured, O
without O
skipping O
a O
word, O
all O
the O
accounts O
of O
first O
nights, O
races, O
and O
soirees, O
took O
interest O
in O
the O
debut O
of O
a O
singer, O
in O
the O
opening O
of O
a O
new O
shop. O
She O
knew O
the O
latest O
fashions, O
the O
addresses O
of O
the O
best O
tailors, O
the O
days O
of O
the O
Bois O
and O
the O
Opera. O
In O
Eugene O
Sue O
she O
studied O
descriptions O
of O
furniture; O
she O
read O
Balzac O
and O
George O
Sand, O
seeking O
in O
them O
imaginary O
satisfaction O
for O
her O
own O
desires. O
Even O
at O
table O
she O
had O
her O
book O
by O
her, O
and O
turned O
over O
the O
pages O
while O
Charles O
ate O
and O
talked O
to O
her. O
The O
memory O
of O
the O
Viscount O
always O
returned O
as O
she O
read. O
Between O
him O
and O
the O
imaginary O
personages O
she O
made O
comparisons. O
But O
the O
circle O
of O
which O
he O
was O
the O
centre O
gradually O
widened O
round O
him, O
and O
the O
aureole O
that O
he O
bore, O
fading O
from O
his O
form, O
broadened O
out O
beyond, O
lighting O
up O
her O
other O
dreams. O
Paris, O
more O
vague O
than O
the O
ocean, O
glimmered O
before O
Emma's O
eyes O
in O
an O
atmosphere O
of O
vermilion. O
The O
many O
lives O
that O
stirred O
amid O
this O
tumult O
were, O
however, O
divided O
into O
parts, O
classed O
as O
distinct O
pictures. O
Emma O
perceived O
only O
two O
or O
three O
that O
hid O
from O
her O
all O
the O
rest, O
and O
in O
themselves O
represented O
all O
humanity. O
The O
world O
of O
ambassadors O
moved O
over O
polished O
floors O
in O
drawing O
rooms O
lined O
with O
mirrors, O
round O
oval O
tables O
covered O
with O
velvet O
and O
gold-fringed O
cloths. O
There O
were O
dresses O
with O
trains, O
deep O
mysteries, O
anguish O
hidden O
beneath O
smiles. O
Then O
came O
the O
society O
of O
the O
duchesses; O
all O
were O
pale; O
all O
got O
up O
at O
four O
o'clock; O
the O
women, O
poor O
angels, O
wore O
English O
point O
on O
their O
petticoats; O
and O
the O
men, O
unappreciated O
geniuses O
under O
a O
frivolous O
outward O
seeming, O
rode O
horses O
to O
death O
at O
pleasure O
parties, O
spent O
the O
summer O
season O
at O
Baden, O
and O
towards O
the O
forties O
married O
heiresses. O
In O
the O
private O
rooms O
of O
restaurants, O
where O
one O
sups O
after O
midnight O
by O
the O
light O
of O
wax O
candles, O
laughed O
the O
motley O
crowd O
of O
men O
of O
letters O
and O
actresses. O
They O
were O
prodigal O
as O
kings, O
full O
of O
ideal, O
ambitious, O
fantastic O
frenzy. O
This O
was O
an O
existence O
outside O
that O
of O
all O
others, O
between O
heaven O
and O
earth, O
in O
the O
midst O
of O
storms, O
having O
something O
of O
the O
sublime. O
For O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
world O
it O
was O
lost, O
with O
no O
particular O
place O
and O
as O
if O
non-existent. O
The O
nearer O
things O
were, O
moreover, O
the O
more O
her O
thoughts O
turned O
away O
from O
them. O
All O
her O
immediate O
surroundings, O
the O
wearisome O
country, O
the O
middle-class O
imbeciles, O
the O
mediocrity O
of O
existence, O
seemed O
to O
her O
exceptional, O
a O
peculiar O
chance O
that O
had O
caught O
hold O
of O
her, O
while O
beyond O
stretched, O
as O
far O
as O
eye O
could O
see, O
an O
immense O
land O
of O
joys O
and O
passions. O
She O
confused O
in O
her O
desire O
the O
sensualities O
of O
luxury O
with O
the O
delights O
of O
the O
heart, O
elegance O
of O
manners O
with O
delicacy O
of O
sentiment. O
Did O
not O
love, O
like O
Indian O
plants, O
need O
a O
special O
soil, O
a O
particular O
temperature? O
Signs O
by O
moonlight, O
long O
embraces, O
tears O
flowing O
over O
yielded O
hands, O
all O
the O
fevers O
of O
the O
flesh O
and O
the O
languors O
of O
tenderness O
could O
not O
be O
separated O
from O
the O
balconies O
of O
great O
castles O
full O
of O
indolence, O
from O
boudoirs O
with O
silken O
curtains O
and O
thick O
carpets, O
well-filled O
flower-stands, O
a O
bed O
on O
a O
raised O
dias, O
nor O
from O
the O
flashing O
of O
precious O
stones O
and O
the O
shoulder-knots O
of O
liveries. O
The O
lad O
from O
the O
posting O
house O
who O
came O
to O
groom O
the O
mare O
every O
morning O
passed O
through O
the O
passage O
with O
his O
heavy O
wooden O
shoes; O
there O
were O
holes O
in O
his O
blouse; O
his O
feet O
were O
bare O
in O
list O
slippers. O
And O
this O
was O
the O
groom O
in O
knee-britches O
with O
whom O
she O
had O
to O
be O
content! O
His O
work O
done, O
he O
did O
not O
come O
back O
again O
all O
day, O
for O
Charles O
on O
his O
return O
put O
up O
his O
horse O
himself, O
unsaddled O
him O
and O
put O
on O
the O
halter, O
while O
the O
servant-girl O
brought O
a O
bundle O
of O
straw O
and O
threw O
it O
as O
best O
she O
could O
into O
the O
manger. O
To O
replace O
Nastasie O
(who O
left O
Tostes O
shedding O
torrents O
of O
tears) O
Emma O
took O
into O
her O
service O
a O
young O
girl O
of O
fourteen, O
an O
orphan O
with O
a O
sweet O
face. O
She O
forbade O
her O
wearing O
cotton O
caps, O
taught O
her O
to O
address O
her O
in O
the O
third O
person, O
to O
bring O
a O
glass O
of O
water O
on O
a O
plate, O
to O
knock O
before O
coming O
into O
a O
room, O
to O
iron, O
starch, O
and O
to O
dress O
her-- O
wanted O
to O
make O
a O
lady's-maid O
of O
her. O
The O
new O
servant O
obeyed O
without O
a O
murmur, O
so O
as O
not O
to O
be O
sent O
away; O
and O
as O
madame O
usually O
left O
the O
key O
in O
the O
sideboard, O
Felicite O
every O
evening O
took O
a O
small O
supply O
of O
sugar O
that O
she O
ate O
alone O
in O
her O
bed O
after O
she O
had O
said O
her O
prayers. O
Sometimes O
in O
the O
afternoon O
she O
went O
to O
chat O
with O
the O
postilions. O
Madame O
was O
in O
her O
room O
upstairs. O
She O
wore O
an O
open O
dressing O
gown O
that O
showed O
between O
the O
shawl O
facings O
of O
her O
bodice O
a O
pleated O
chamisette O
with O
three O
gold O
buttons. O
Her O
belt O
was O
a O
corded O
girdle O
with O
great O
tassels, O
and O
her O
small O
garnet O
coloured O
slippers O
had O
a O
large O
knot O
of O
ribbon O
that O
fell O
over O
her O
instep. O
She O
had O
bought O
herself O
a O
blotting O
book, O
writing O
case, O
pen-holder, O
and O
envelopes, O
although O
she O
had O
no O
one O
to O
write O
to; O
she O
dusted O
her O
what-not, O
looked O
at O
herself O
in O
the O
glass, O
picked O
up O
a O
book, O
and O
then, O
dreaming O
between O
the O
lines, O
let O
it O
drop O
on O
her O
knees. O
She O
longed O
to O
travel O
or O
to O
go O
back O
to O
her O
convent. O
She O
wished O
at O
the O
same O
time O
to O
die O
and O
to O
live O
in O
Paris. O
Charles O
in O
snow O
and O
rain O
trotted O
across O
country. O
He O
ate O
omelettes O
on O
farmhouse O
tables, O
poked O
his O
arm O
into O
damp O
beds, O
received O
the O
tepid O
spurt O
of O
blood-lettings O
in O
his O
face, O
listened O
to O
death-rattles, O
examined O
basins, O
turned O
over O
a O
good O
deal O
of O
dirty O
linen; O
but O
every O
evening O
he O
found O
a O
blazing O
fire, O
his O
dinner O
ready, O
easy-chairs, O
and O
a O
well-dressed O
woman, O
charming O
with O
an O
odour O
of O
freshness, O
though O
no O
one O
could O
say O
whence O
the O
perfume O
came, O
or O
if O
it O
were O
not O
her O
skin O
that O
made O
odorous O
her O
chemise. O
She O
charmed O
him O
by O
numerous O
attentions; O
now O
it O
was O
some O
new O
way O
of O
arranging O
paper O
sconces O
for O
the O
candles, O
a O
flounce O
that O
she O
altered O
on O
her O
gown, O
or O
an O
extraordinary O
name O
for O
some O
very O
simple O
dish O
that O
the O
servant O
had O
spoilt, O
but O
that O
Charles O
swallowed O
with O
pleasure O
to O
the O
last O
mouthful. O
At O
Rouen O
she O
saw O
some O
ladies O
who O
wore O
a O
bunch O
of O
charms O
on O
the O
watch-chains; O
she O
bought O
some O
charms. O
She O
wanted O
for O
her O
mantelpiece O
two O
large O
blue O
glass O
vases, O
and O
some O
time O
after O
an O
ivory O
necessaire O
with O
a O
silver-gilt O
thimble. O
The O
less O
Charles O
understood O
these O
refinements O
the O
more O
they O
seduced O
him. O
They O
added O
something O
to O
the O
pleasure O
of O
the O
senses O
and O
to O
the O
comfort O
of O
his O
fireside. O
It O
was O
like O
a O
golden O
dust O
sanding O
all O
along O
the O
narrow O
path O
of O
his O
life. O
He O
was O
well, O
looked O
well; O
his O
reputation O
was O
firmly O
established. O
The O
country-folk O
loved O
him O
because O
he O
was O
not O
proud. O
He O
petted O
the O
children, O
never O
went O
to O
the O
public O
house, O
and, O
moreover, O
his O
morals O
inspired O
confidence. O
He O
was O
specially O
successful O
with O
catarrhs O
and O
chest O
complaints. O
Being O
much O
afraid O
of O
killing O
his O
patients, O
Charles, O
in O
fact O
only O
prescribed O
sedatives, O
from O
time O
to O
time O
and O
emetic, O
a O
footbath, O
or O
leeches. O
It O
was O
not O
that O
he O
was O
afraid O
of O
surgery; O
he O
bled O
people O
copiously O
like O
horses, O
and O
for O
the O
taking O
out O
of O
teeth O
he O
had O
the O
"devil's O
own O
wrist." O
Finally, O
to O
keep O
up O
with O
the O
times, O
he O
took O
in O
"La O
Ruche O
Medicale," O
a O
new O
journal O
whose O
prospectus O
had O
been O
sent O
him. O
He O
read O
it O
a O
little O
after O
dinner, O
but O
in O
about O
five O
minutes O
the O
warmth O
of O
the O
room O
added O
to O
the O
effect O
of O
his O
dinner O
sent O
him O
to O
sleep; O
and O
he O
sat O
there, O
his O
chin O
on O
his O
two O
hands O
and O
his O
hair O
spreading O
like O
a O
mane O
to O
the O
foot O
of O
the O
lamp. O
Emma O
looked O
at O
him O
and O
shrugged O
her O
shoulders. O
Why, O
at O
least, O
was O
not O
her O
husband O
one O
of O
those O
men O
of O
taciturn O
passions O
who O
work O
at O
their O
books O
all O
night, O
and O
at O
last, O
when O
about O
sixty, O
the O
age O
of O
rheumatism O
sets O
in, O
wear O
a O
string O
of O
orders O
on O
their O
ill-fitting O
black O
coat? O
She O
could O
have O
wished O
this O
name O
of O
Bovary, O
which O
was O
hers, O
had O
been O
illustrious, O
to O
see O
it O
displayed O
at O
the O
booksellers', O
repeated O
in O
the O
newspapers, O
known O
to O
all O
France. O
But O
Charles O
had O
no O
ambition. O
An O
Yvetot O
doctor O
whom O
he O
had O
lately O
met O
in O
consultation O
had O
somewhat O
humiliated O
him O
at O
the O
very O
bedside O
of O
the O
patient, O
before O
the O
assembled O
relatives. O
When, O
in O
the O
evening, O
Charles O
told O
her O
this O
anecdote, O
Emma O
inveighed O
loudly O
against O
his O
colleague. O
Charles O
was O
much O
touched. O
He O
kissed O
her O
forehead O
with O
a O
tear O
in O
his O
eyes. O
But O
she O
was O
angered O
with O
shame; O
she O
felt O
a O
wild O
desire O
to O
strike O
him; O
she O
went O
to O
open O
the O
window O
in O
the O
passage O
and O
breathed O
in O
the O
fresh O
air O
to O
calm O
herself. O
"What O
a O
man! O
What O
a O
man!" O
she O
said O
in O
a O
low O
voice, O
biting O
her O
lips. O
Besides, O
she O
was O
becoming O
more O
irritated O
with O
him. O
As O
he O
grew O
older O
his O
manner O
grew O
heavier; O
at O
dessert O
he O
cut O
the O
corks O
of O
the O
empty O
bottles; O
after O
eating O
he O
cleaned O
his O
teeth O
with O
his O
tongue; O
in O
taking O
soup O
he O
made O
a O
gurgling O
noise O
with O
every O
spoonful; O
and, O
as O
he O
was O
getting O
fatter, O
the O
puffed-out O
cheeks O
seemed O
to O
push O
the O
eyes, O
always O
small, O
up O
to O
the O
temples. O
Sometimes O
Emma O
tucked O
the O
red O
borders O
of O
his O
under-vest O
unto O
his O
waistcoat, O
rearranged O
his O
cravat, O
and O
threw O
away O
the O
dirty O
gloves O
he O
was O
going O
to O
put O
on; O
and O
this O
was O
not, O
as O
he O
fancied, O
for O
himself; O
it O
was O
for O
herself, O
by O
a O
diffusion O
of O
egotism, O
of O
nervous O
irritation. O
Sometimes, O
too, O
she O
told O
him O
of O
what O
she O
had O
read, O
such O
as O
a O
passage O
in O
a O
novel, O
of O
a O
new O
play, O
or O
an O
anecdote O
of O
the O
"upper O
ten" O
that O
she O
had O
seen O
in O
a O
feuilleton; O
for, O
after O
all, O
Charles O
was O
something, O
an O
ever-open O
ear, O
and O
ever-ready O
approbation. O
She O
confided O
many O
a O
thing O
to O
her O
greyhound. O
She O
would O
have O
done O
so O
to O
the O
logs O
in O
the O
fireplace O
or O
to O
the O
pendulum O
of O
the O
clock. O
At O
the O
bottom O
of O
her O
heart, O
however, O
she O
was O
waiting O
for O
something O
to O
happen. O
Like O
shipwrecked O
sailors, O
she O
turned O
despairing O
eyes O
upon O
the O
solitude O
of O
her O
life, O
seeking O
afar O
off O
some O
white O
sail O
in O
the O
mists O
of O
the O
horizon. O
She O
did O
not O
know O
what O
this O
chance O
would O
be, O
what O
wind O
would O
bring O
it O
her, O
towards O
what O
shore O
it O
would O
drive O
her, O
if O
it O
would O
be O
a O
shallop O
or O
a O
three-decker, O
laden O
with O
anguish O
or O
full O
of O
bliss O
to O
the O
portholes. O
But O
each O
morning, O
as O
she O
awoke, O
she O
hoped O
it O
would O
come O
that O
day; O
she O
listened O
to O
every O
sound, O
sprang O
up O
with O
a O
start, O
wondered O
that O
it O
did O
not O
come; O
then O
at O
sunset, O
always O
more O
saddened, O
she O
longed O
for O
the O
morrow. O
Spring O
came O
round. O
With O
the O
first O
warm O
weather, O
when O
the O
pear O
trees O
began O
to O
blossom, O
she O
suffered O
from O
dyspnoea. O
From O
the O
beginning O
of O
July O
she O
counted O
how O
many O
weeks O
there O
were O
to O
October, O
thinking O
that O
perhaps O
the O
Marquis O
d'Andervilliers O
would O
give O
another O
ball O
at O
Vaubyessard. O
But O
all O
September O
passed O
without O
letters O
or O
visits. O
After O
the O
ennui O
of O
this O
disappointment O
her O
heart O
once O
more O
remained O
empty, O
and O
then O
the O
same O
series O
of O
days O
recommenced. O
So O
now O
they O
would O
thus O
follow O
one O
another, O
always O
the O
same, O
immovable, O
and O
bringing O
nothing. O
Other O
lives, O
however O
flat, O
had O
at O
least O
the O
chance O
of O
some O
event. O
One O
adventure O
sometimes O
brought O
with O
it O
infinite O
consequences O
and O
the O
scene O
changed. O
But O
nothing O
happened O
to O
her; O
God O
had O
willed O
it O
so! O
The O
future O
was O
a O
dark O
corridor, O
with O
its O
door O
at O
the O
end O
shut O
fast. O
She O
gave O
up O
music. O
What O
was O
the O
good O
of O
playing? O
Who O
would O
hear O
her? O
Since O
she O
could O
never, O
in O
a O
velvet O
gown O
with O
short O
sleeves, O
striking O
with O
her O
light O
fingers O
the O
ivory O
keys O
of O
an O
Erard O
at O
a O
concert, O
feel O
the O
murmur O
of O
ecstasy O
envelop O
her O
like O
a O
breeze, O
it O
was O
not O
worth O
while O
boring O
herself O
with O
practicing. O
Her O
drawing O
cardboard O
and O
her O
embroidery O
she O
left O
in O
the O
cupboard. O
What O
was O
the O
good? O
What O
was O
the O
good? O
Sewing O
irritated O
her. O
"I O
have O
read O
everything," O
she O
said O
to O
herself. O
And O
she O
sat O
there O
making O
the O
tongs O
red-hot, O
or O
looked O
at O
the O
rain O
falling. O
How O
sad O
she O
was O
on O
Sundays O
when O
vespers O
sounded! O
She O
listened O
with O
dull O
attention O
to O
each O
stroke O
of O
the O
cracked O
bell. O
A O
cat O
slowly O
walking O
over O
some O
roof O
put O
up O
his O
back O
in O
the O
pale O
rays O
of O
the O
sun. O
The O
wind O
on O
the O
highroad O
blew O
up O
clouds O
of O
dust. O
Afar O
off O
a O
dog O
sometimes O
howled; O
and O
the O
bell, O
keeping O
time, O
continued O
its O
monotonous O
ringing O
that O
died O
away O
over O
the O
fields. O
But O
the O
people O
came O
out O
from O
church. O
The O
women O
in O
waxed O
clogs, O
the O
peasants O
in O
new O
blouses, O
the O
little O
bare-headed O
children O
skipping O
along O
in O
front O
of O
them, O
all O
were O
going O
home. O
And O
till O
nightfall, O
five O
or O
six O
men, O
always O
the O
same, O
stayed O
playing O
at O
corks O
in O
front O
of O
the O
large O
door O
of O
the O
inn. O
The O
winter O
was O
severe. O
The O
windows O
every O
morning O
were O
covered O
with O
rime, O
and O
the O
light O
shining O
through O
them, O
dim O
as O
through O
ground-glass, O
sometimes O
did O
not O
change O
the O
whole O
day O
long. O
At O
four O
o'clock O
the O
lamp O
had O
to O
be O
lighted. O
On O
fine O
days O
she O
went O
down O
into O
the O
garden. O
The O
dew O
had O
left O
on O
the O
cabbages O
a O
silver O
lace O
with O
long O
transparent O
threads O
spreading O
from O
one O
to O
the O
other. O
No O
birds O
were O
to O
be O
heard; O
everything O
seemed O
asleep, O
the O
espalier O
covered O
with O
straw, O
and O
the O
vine, O
like O
a O
great O
sick O
serpent O
under O
the O
coping O
of O
the O
wall, O
along O
which, O
on O
drawing O
hear, O
one O
saw O
the O
many-footed O
woodlice O
crawling. O
Under O
the O
spruce O
by O
the O
hedgerow, O
the O
curie O
in O
the O
three-cornered O
hat O
reading O
his O
breviary O
had O
lost O
his O
right O
foot, O
and O
the O
very O
plaster, O
scaling O
off O
with O
the O
frost, O
had O
left O
white O
scabs O
on O
his O
face. O
Then O
she O
went O
up O
again, O
shut O
her O
door, O
put O
on O
coals, O
and O
fainting O
with O
the O
heat O
of O
the O
hearth, O
felt O
her O
boredom O
weigh O
more O
heavily O
than O
ever. O
She O
would O
have O
liked O
to O
go O
down O
and O
talk O
to O
the O
servant, O
but O
a O
sense O
of O
shame O
restrained O
her. O
Every O
day O
at O
the O
same O
time O
the O
schoolmaster O
in O
a O
black O
skullcap O
opened O
the O
shutters O
of O
his O
house, O
and O
the O
rural O
policeman, O
wearing O
his O
sabre O
over O
his O
blouse, O
passed O
by. O
Night O
and O
morning O
the O
post-horses, O
three O
by O
three, O
crossed O
the O
street O
to O
water O
at O
the O
pond. O
From O
time O
to O
time O
the O
bell O
of O
a O
public O
house O
door O
rang, O
and O
when O
it O
was O
windy O
one O
could O
hear O
the O
little O
brass O
basins O
that O
served O
as O
signs O
for O
the O
hairdresser's O
shop O
creaking O
on O
their O
two O
rods. O
This O
shop O
had O
as O
decoration O
an O
old O
engraving O
of O
a O
fashion-plate O
stuck O
against O
a O
windowpane O
and O
the O
wax O
bust O
of O
a O
woman O
with O
yellow O
hair. O
He, O
too, O
the O
hairdresser, O
lamented O
his O
wasted O
calling, O
his O
hopeless O
future, O
and O
dreaming O
of O
some O
shop O
in O
a O
big O
town-- O
at O
Rouen, O
for O
example, O
overlooking O
the O
harbour, O
near O
the O
theatre-- O
he O
walked O
up O
and O
down O
all O
day O
from O
the O
mairie O
to O
the O
church, O
sombre O
and O
waiting O
for O
customers. O
When O
Madame O
Bovary O
looked O
up, O
she O
always O
saw O
him O
there, O
like O
a O
sentinel O
on O
duty, O
with O
his O
skullcap O
over O
his O
ears O
and O
his O
vest O
of O
lasting. O
Sometimes O
in O
the O
afternoon O
outside O
the O
window O
of O
her O
room, O
the O
head O
of O
a O
man O
appeared, O
a O
swarthy O
head O
with O
black O
whiskers, O
smiling O
slowly, O
with O
a O
broad, O
gentle O
smile O
that O
showed O
his O
white O
teeth. O
A O
waltz O
immediately O
began O
and O
on O
the O
organ, O
in O
a O
little O
drawing O
room, O
dancers O
the O
size O
of O
a O
finger, O
women O
in O
pink O
turbans, O
Tyrolians O
in O
jackets, O
monkeys O
in O
frock O
coats, O
gentlemen O
in O
knee-breeches, O
turned O
and O
turned O
between O
the O
sofas, O
the O
consoles, O
multiplied O
in O
the O
bits O
of O
looking O
glass O
held O
together O
at O
their O
corners O
by O
a O
piece O
of O
gold O
paper. O
The O
man O
turned O
his O
handle, O
looking O
to O
the O
right O
and O
left, O
and O
up O
at O
the O
windows. O
Now O
and O
again, O
while O
he O
shot O
out O
a O
long O
squirt O
of O
brown O
saliva O
against O
the O
milestone, O
with O
his O
knee O
raised O
his O
instrument, O
whose O
hard O
straps O
tired O
his O
shoulder; O
and O
now, O
doleful O
and O
drawling, O
or O
gay O
and O
hurried, O
the O
music O
escaped O
from O
the O
box, O
droning O
through O
a O
curtain O
of O
pink O
taffeta O
under O
a O
brass O
claw O
in O
arabesque. O
They O
were O
airs O
played O
in O
other O
places O
at O
the O
theatres, O
sung O
in O
drawing O
rooms, O
danced O
to O
at O
night O
under O
lighted O
lustres, O
echoes O
of O
the O
world O
that O
reached O
even O
to O
Emma. O
Endless O
sarabands O
ran O
through O
her O
head, O
and, O
like O
an O
Indian O
dancing O
girl O
on O
the O
flowers O
of O
a O
carpet, O
her O
thoughts O
leapt O
with O
the O
notes, O
swung O
from O
dream O
to O
dream, O
from O
sadness O
to O
sadness. O
When O
the O
man O
had O
caught O
some O
coppers O
in O
his O
cap, O
he O
drew O
down O
an O
old O
cover O
of O
blue O
cloth, O
hitched O
his O
organ O
on O
to O
his O
back, O
and O
went O
off O
with O
a O
heavy O
tread. O
She O
watched O
him O
going. O
But O
it O
was O
above O
all O
the O
meal-times O
that O
were O
unbearable O
to O
her, O
in O
this O
small O
room O
on O
the O
ground O
floor, O
with O
its O
smoking O
stove, O
its O
creaking O
door, O
the O
walls O
that O
sweated, O
the O
damp O
flags; O
all O
the O
bitterness O
in O
life O
seemed O
served O
up O
on O
her O
plate, O
and O
with O
smoke O
of O
the O
boiled O
beef O
there O
rose O
from O
her O
secret O
soul O
whiffs O
of O
sickliness. O
Charles O
was O
a O
slow O
eater; O
she O
played O
with O
a O
few O
nuts, O
or, O
leaning O
on O
her O
elbow, O
amused O
herself O
with O
drawing O
lines O
along O
the O
oilcloth O
table O
cover O
with O
the O
point O
of O
her O
knife. O
She O
now O
let O
everything O
in O
her O
household O
take O
care O
of O
itself, O
and O
Madame O
Bovary O
senior, O
when O
she O
came O
to O
spend O
part O
of O
Lent O
at O
Tostes, O
was O
much O
surprised O
at O
the O
change. O
She O
who O
was O
formerly O
so O
careful, O
so O
dainty, O
now O
passed O
whole O
days O
without O
dressing, O
wore O
grey O
cotton O
stockings, O
and O
burnt O
tallow O
candles. O
She O
kept O
saying O
they O
must O
be O
economical O
since O
they O
were O
not O
rich, O
adding O
that O
she O
was O
very O
contented, O
very O
happy, O
that O
Tostes O
pleased O
her O
very O
much, O
with O
other O
speeches O
that O
closed O
the O
mouth O
of O
her O
mother-in-law. O
Besides, O
Emma O
no O
longer O
seemed O
inclined O
to O
follow O
her O
advice; O
once O
even, O
Madame O
Bovary O
having O
thought O
fit O
to O
maintain O
that O
mistresses O
ought O
to O
keep O
an O
eye O
on O
the O
religion O
of O
their O
servants, O
she O
had O
answered O
with O
so O
angry O
a O
look O
and O
so O
cold O
a O
smile O
that O
the O
good O
woman O
did O
not O
interfere O
again. O
Emma O
was O
growing O
difficult, O
capricious. O
She O
ordered O
dishes O
for O
herself, O
then O
she O
did O
not O
touch O
them; O
one O
day O
drank O
only O
pure O
milk, O
the O
next O
cups O
of O
tea O
by O
the O
dozen. O
Often O
she O
persisted O
in O
not O
going O
out, O
then, O
stifling, O
threw O
open O
the O
windows O
and O
put O
on O
light O
dresses. O
After O
she O
had O
well O
scolded O
her O
servant O
she O
gave O
her O
presents O
or O
sent O
her O
out O
to O
see O
neighbours, O
just O
as O
she O
sometimes O
threw O
beggars O
all O
the O
silver O
in O
her O
purse, O
although O
she O
was O
by O
no O
means O
tender-hearted O
or O
easily O
accessible O
to O
the O
feelings O
of O
others, O
like O
most O
country-bred O
people, O
who O
always O
retain O
in O
their O
souls O
something O
of O
the O
horny O
hardness O
of O
the O
paternal O
hands. O
Towards O
the O
end O
of O
February O
old O
Rouault, O
in O
memory O
of O
his O
cure, O
himself O
brought O
his O
son-in-law O
a O
superb O
turkey, O
and O
stayed O
three O
days O
at O
Tostes. O
Charles O
being O
with O
his O
patients, O
Emma O
kept O
him O
company. O
He O
smoked O
in O
the O
room, O
spat O
on O
the O
firedogs, O
talked O
farming, O
calves, O
cows, O
poultry, O
and O
municipal O
council, O
so O
that O
when O
he O
left O
she O
closed O
the O
door O
on O
him O
with O
a O
feeling O
of O
satisfaction O
that O
surprised O
even O
herself. O
Moreover O
she O
no O
longer O
concealed O
her O
contempt O
for O
anything O
or O
anybody, O
and O
at O
times O
she O
set O
herself O
to O
express O
singular O
opinions, O
finding O
fault O
with O
that O
which O
others O
approved, O
and O
approving O
things O
perverse O
and O
immoral, O
all O
of O
which O
made O
her O
husband O
open O
his O
eyes O
widely. O
Would O
this O
misery O
last O
for O
ever? O
Would O
she O
never O
issue O
from O
it? O
Yet O
she O
was O
as O
good O
as O
all O
the O
women O
who O
were O
living O
happily. O
She O
had O
seen O
duchesses O
at O
Vaubyessard O
with O
clumsier O
waists O
and O
commoner O
ways, O
and O
she O
execrated O
the O
injustice O
of O
God. O
She O
leant O
her O
head O
against O
the O
walls O
to O
weep; O
she O
envied O
lives O
of O
stir; O
longed O
for O
masked O
balls, O
for O
violent O
pleasures, O
with O
all O
the O
wildness O
that O
she O
did O
not O
know, O
but O
that O
these O
must O
surely O
yield. O
She O
grew O
pale O
and O
suffered O
from O
palpitations O
of O
the O
heart. O
Charles O
prescribed O
valerian O
and O
camphor O
baths. O
Everything O
that O
was O
tried O
only O
seemed O
to O
irritate O
her O
the O
more. O
On O
certain O
days O
she O
chatted O
with O
feverish O
rapidity, O
and O
this O
over-excitement O
was O
suddenly O
followed O
by O
a O
state O
of O
torpor, O
in O
which O
she O
remained O
without O
speaking, O
without O
moving. O
What O
then O
revived O
her O
was O
pouring O
a O
bottle O
of O
eau-de-cologne O
over O
her O
arms. O
As O
she O
was O
constantly O
complaining O
about O
Tostes, O
Charles O
fancied O
that O
her O
illness O
was O
no O
doubt O
due O
to O
some O
local O
cause, O
and O
fixing O
on O
this O
idea, O
began O
to O
think O
seriously O
of O
setting O
up O
elsewhere. O
From O
that O
moment O
she O
drank O
vinegar, O
contracted O
a O
sharp O
little O
cough, O
and O
completely O
lost O
her O
appetite. O
It O
cost O
Charles O
much O
to O
give O
up O
Tostes O
after O
living O
there O
four O
years O
and O
"when O
he O
was O
beginning O
to O
get O
on O
there." O
Yet O
if O
it O
must O
be! O
He O
took O
her O
to O
Rouen O
to O
see O
his O
old O
master. O
It O
was O
a O
nervous O
complaint: O
change O
of O
air O
was O
needed. O
After O
looking O
about O
him O
on O
this O
side O
and O
on O
that, O
Charles O
learnt O
that O
in O
the O
Neufchatel O
arrondissement O
there O
was O
a O
considerable O
market O
town O
called O
Yonville-l'Abbaye, O
whose O
doctor, O
a O
Polish O
refugee, O
had O
decamped O
a O
week O
before. O
Then O
he O
wrote O
to O
the O
chemist O
of O
the O
place O
to O
ask O
the O
number O
of O
the O
population, O
the O
distance O
from O
the O
nearest O
doctor, O
what O
his O
predecessor O
had O
made O
a O
year, O
and O
so O
forth; O
and O
the O
answer O
being O
satisfactory, O
he O
made O
up O
his O
mind O
to O
move O
towards O
the O
spring, O
if O
Emma's O
health O
did O
not O
improve. O
One O
day O
when, O
in O
view O
of O
her O
departure, O
she O
was O
tidying O
a O
drawer, O
something O
pricked O
her O
finger. O
It O
was O
a O
wire O
of O
her O
wedding O
bouquet. O
The O
orange O
blossoms O
were O
yellow O
with O
dust O
and O
the O
silver O
bordered O
satin O
ribbons O
frayed O
at O
the O
edges. O
She O
threw O
it O
into O
the O
fire. O
It O
flared O
up O
more O
quickly O
than O
dry O
straw. O
Then O
it O
was, O
like O
a O
red O
bush O
in O
the O
cinders, O
slowly O
devoured. O
She O
watched O
it O
burn. O
The O
little O
pasteboard O
berries O
burst, O
the O
wire O
twisted, O
the O
gold O
lace O
melted; O
and O
the O
shriveled O
paper O
corollas, O
fluttering O
like O
black O
butterflies O
at O
the O
back O
of O
the O
stove, O
at O
least O
flew O
up O
the O
chimney. O
When O
they O
left O
Tostes O
at O
the O
month O
of O
March, O
Madame O
Bovary O
was O
pregnant. O
PART O
II O
CHAPTER O
ONE O
Yonville-l'Abbaye O
(so O
called O
from O
an O
old O
Capuchin O
abbey O
of O
which O
not O
even O
the O
ruins O
remain) O
is O
a O
market-town O
twenty-four O
miles O
from O
Rouen, O
between O
the O
Abbeville O
and O
Beauvais O
roads, O
at O
the O
foot O
of O
a O
valley O
watered O
by O
the O
Rieule, O
a O
little O
river O
that O
runs O
into O
the O
Andelle O
after O
turning O
three O
water-mills O
near O
its O
mouth, O
where O
there O
are O
a O
few O
trout O
that O
the O
lads O
amuse O
themselves O
by O
fishing O
for O
on O
Sundays. O
We O
leave O
the O
highroad O
at O
La O
Boissiere O
and O
keep O
straight O
on O
to O
the O
top O
of O
the O
Leux O
hill, O
whence O
the O
valley O
is O
seen. O
The O
river O
that O
runs O
through O
it O
makes O
of O
it, O
as O
it O
were, O
two O
regions O
with O
distinct O
physiognomies-- O
all O
on O
the O
left O
is O
pasture O
land, O
all O
of O
the O
right O
arable. O
The O
meadow O
stretches O
under O
a O
bulge O
of O
low O
hills O
to O
join O
at O
the O
back O
with O
the O
pasture O
land O
of O
the O
Bray O
country, O
while O
on O
the O
eastern O
side, O
the O
plain, O
gently O
rising, O
broadens O
out, O
showing O
as O
far O
as O
eye O
can O
follow O
its O
blond O
cornfields. O
The O
water, O
flowing O
by O
the O
grass, O
divides O
with O
a O
white O
line O
the O
colour O
of O
the O
roads O
and O
of O
the O
plains, O
and O
the O
country O
is O
like O
a O
great O
unfolded O
mantle O
with O
a O
green O
velvet O
cape O
bordered O
with O
a O
fringe O
of O
silver. O
Before O
us, O
on O
the O
verge O
of O
the O
horizon, O
lie O
the O
oaks O
of O
the O
forest O
of O
Argueil, O
with O
the O
steeps O
of O
the O
Saint-Jean O
hills O
scarred O
from O
top O
to O
bottom O
with O
red O
irregular O
lines; O
they O
are O
rain O
tracks, O
and O
these O
brick-tones O
standing O
out O
in O
narrow O
streaks O
against O
the O
grey O
colour O
of O
the O
mountain O
are O
due O
to O
the O
quantity O
of O
iron O
springs O
that O
flow O
beyond O
in O
the O
neighboring O
country. O
Here O
we O
are O
on O
the O
confines O
of O
Normandy, O
Picardy, O
and O
the O
Ile-de-France, O
a O
bastard O
land O
whose O
language O
is O
without O
accent O
and O
its O
landscape O
is O
without O
character. O
It O
is O
there O
that O
they O
make O
the O
worst O
Neufchatel O
cheeses O
of O
all O
the O
arrondissement; O
and, O
on O
the O
other O
hand, O
farming O
is O
costly O
because O
so O
much O
manure O
is O
needed O
to O
enrich O
this O
friable O
soil O
full O
of O
sand O
and O
flints. O
Up O
to O
1835 O
there O
was O
no O
practicable O
road O
for O
getting O
to O
Yonville, O
but O
about O
this O
time O
a O
cross-road O
was O
made O
which O
joins O
that O
of O
Abbeville O
to O
that O
of O
Amiens, O
and O
is O
occasionally O
used O
by O
the O
Rouen O
wagoners O
on O
their O
way O
to O
Flanders. O
Yonville-l'Abbaye O
has O
remained O
stationary O
in O
spite O
of O
its O
"new O
outlet." O
Instead O
of O
improving O
the O
soil, O
they O
persist O
in O
keeping O
up O
the O
pasture O
lands, O
however O
depreciated O
they O
may O
be O
in O
value, O
and O
the O
lazy O
borough, O
growing O
away O
from O
the O
plain, O
has O
naturally O
spread O
riverwards. O
It O
is O
seem O
from O
afar O
sprawling O
along O
the O
banks O
like O
a O
cowherd O
taking O
a O
siesta O
by O
the O
water-side. O
At O
the O
foot O
of O
the O
hill O
beyond O
the O
bridge O
begins O
a O
roadway, O
planted O
with O
young O
aspens, O
that O
leads O
in O
a O
straight O
line O
to O
the O
first O
houses O
in O
the O
place. O
These, O
fenced O
in O
by O
hedges, O
are O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
courtyards O
full O
of O
straggling O
buildings, O
wine-presses, O
cart-sheds O
and O
distilleries O
scattered O
under O
thick O
trees, O
with O
ladders, O
poles, O
or O
scythes O
hung O
on O
to O
the O
branches. O
The O
thatched O
roofs, O
like O
fur O
caps O
drawn O
over O
eyes, O
reach O
down O
over O
about O
a O
third O
of O
the O
low O
windows, O
whose O
coarse O
convex O
glasses O
have O
knots O
in O
the O
middle O
like O
the O
bottoms O
of O
bottles. O
Against O
the O
plaster O
wall O
diagonally O
crossed O
by O
black O
joists, O
a O
meagre O
pear-tree O
sometimes O
leans O
and O
the O
ground-floors O
have O
at O
their O
door O
a O
small O
swing-gate O
to O
keep O
out O
the O
chicks O
that O
come O
pilfering O
crumbs O
of O
bread O
steeped O
in O
cider O
on O
the O
threshold. O
But O
the O
courtyards O
grow O
narrower, O
the O
houses O
closer O
together, O
and O
the O
fences O
disappear; O
a O
bundle O
of O
ferns O
swings O
under O
a O
window O
from O
the O
end O
of O
a O
broomstick; O
there O
is O
a O
blacksmith's O
forge O
and O
then O
a O
wheelwright's, O
with O
two O
or O
three O
new O
carts O
outside O
that O
partly O
block O
the O
way. O
Then O
across O
an O
open O
space O
appears O
a O
white O
house O
beyond O
a O
grass O
mound O
ornamented O
by O
a O
Cupid, O
his O
finger O
on O
his O
lips; O
two O
brass O
vases O
are O
at O
each O
end O
of O
a O
flight O
of O
steps; O
scutcheons O
blaze O
upon O
the O
door. O
It O
is O
the O
notary's O
house, O
and O
the O
finest O
in O
the O
place. O
THE O
PANONCEAUX O
THAT O
HAVE O
TO O
BE O
HUNG O
OVER O
THE O
DOORS O
OF O
NOTARIES. O
The O
Church O
is O
on O
the O
other O
side O
of O
the O
street, O
twenty O
paces O
farther O
down, O
at O
the O
entrance O
of O
the O
square. O
The O
little O
cemetery O
that O
surrounds O
it, O
closed O
in O
by O
a O
wall O
breast O
high, O
is O
so O
full O
of O
graves O
that O
the O
old O
stones, O
level O
with O
the O
ground, O
form O
a O
continuous O
pavement, O
on O
which O
the O
grass O
of O
itself O
has O
marked O
out O
regular O
green O
squares. O
The O
church O
was O
rebuilt O
during O
the O
last O
years O
of O
the O
reign O
of O
Charles O
X. O
The O
wooden O
roof O
is O
beginning O
to O
rot O
from O
the O
top, O
and O
here O
and O
there O
has O
black O
hollows O
in O
its O
blue O
colour. O
Over O
the O
door, O
where O
the O
organ O
should O
be, O
is O
a O
loft O
for O
the O
men, O
with O
a O
spiral O
staircase O
that O
reverberates O
under O
their O
wooden O
shoes. O
The O
daylight O
coming O
through O
the O
plain O
glass O
windows O
falls O
obliquely O
upon O
the O
pews O
ranged O
along O
the O
walls, O
which O
are O
adorned O
here O
and O
there O
with O
a O
straw O
mat O
bearing O
beneath O
it O
the O
words O
in O
large O
letters, O
"Mr. O
So-and-so's O
pew." O
Farther O
on, O
at O
a O
spot O
where O
the O
building O
narrows, O
the O
confessional O
forms O
a O
pendant O
to O
a O
statuette O
of O
the O
Virgin, O
clothed O
in O
a O
satin O
robe, O
coifed O
with O
a O
tulle O
veil O
sprinkled O
with O
silver O
stars, O
and O
with O
red O
cheeks, O
like O
an O
idol O
of O
the O
Sandwich O
Islands; O
and, O
finally, O
a O
copy O
of O
the O
"Holy O
Family, O
presented O
by O
the O
Minister O
of O
the O
Interior," O
overlooking O
the O
high O
altar, O
between O
four O
candlesticks, O
closes O
in O
the O
perspective. O
The O
choir O
stalls, O
of O
deal O
wood, O
have O
been O
left O
unpainted. O
The O
market, O
that O
is O
to O
say, O
a O
tiled O
roof O
supported O
by O
some O
twenty O
posts, O
occupies O
of O
itself O
about O
half O
the O
public O
square O
of O
Yonville. O
The O
town O
hall, O
constructed O
"from O
the O
designs O
of O
a O
Paris O
architect," O
is O
a O
sort O
of O
Greek O
temple O
that O
forms O
the O
corner O
next O
to O
the O
chemist's O
shop. O
On O
the O
ground-floor O
are O
three O
Ionic O
columns O
and O
on O
the O
first O
floor O
a O
semicircular O
gallery, O
while O
the O
dome O
that O
crowns O
it O
is O
occupied O
by O
a O
Gallic O
cock, O
resting O
one O
foot O
upon O
the O
"Charte" O
and O
holding O
in O
the O
other O
the O
scales O
of O
Justice. O
But O
that O
which O
most O
attracts O
the O
eye O
is O
opposite O
the O
Lion O
d'Or O
inn, O
the O
chemist's O
shop O
of O
Monsieur O
Homais. O
In O
the O
evening O
especially O
its O
argand O
lamp O
is O
lit O
up O
and O
the O
red O
and O
green O
jars O
that O
embellish O
his O
shop-front O
throw O
far O
across O
the O
street O
their O
two O
streams O
of O
colour; O
then O
across O
them O
as O
if O
in O
Bengal O
lights O
is O
seen O
the O
shadow O
of O
the O
chemist O
leaning O
over O
his O
desk. O
His O
house O
from O
top O
to O
bottom O
is O
placarded O
with O
inscriptions O
written O
in O
large O
hand, O
round O
hand, O
printed O
hand: O
"Vichy, O
Seltzer, O
Barege O
waters, O
blood O
purifiers, O
Raspail O
patent O
medicine, O
Arabian O
racahout, O
Darcet O
lozenges, O
Regnault O
paste, O
trusses, O
baths, O
hygienic O
chocolate," O
etc. O
And O
the O
signboard, O
which O
takes O
up O
all O
the O
breadth O
of O
the O
shop, O
bears O
in O
gold O
letters, O
"Homais, O
Chemist." O
Then O
at O
the O
back O
of O
the O
shop, O
behind O
the O
great O
scales O
fixed O
to O
the O
counter, O
the O
word O
"Laboratory" O
appears O
on O
a O
scroll O
above O
a O
glass O
door, O
which O
about O
half-way O
up O
once O
more O
repeats O
"Homais" O
in O
gold O
letters O
on O
a O
black O
ground. O
Beyond O
this O
there O
is O
nothing O
to O
see O
at O
Yonville. O
The O
street O
(the O
only O
one) O
a O
gunshot O
in O
length O
and O
flanked O
by O
a O
few O
shops O
on O
either O
side O
stops O
short O
at O
the O
turn O
of O
the O
highroad. O
If O
it O
is O
left O
on O
the O
right O
hand O
and O
the O
foot O
of O
the O
Saint-Jean O
hills O
followed O
the O
cemetery O
is O
soon O
reached. O
At O
the O
time O
of O
the O
cholera, O
in O
order O
to O
enlarge O
this, O
a O
piece O
of O
wall O
was O
pulled O
down, O
and O
three O
acres O
of O
land O
by O
its O
side O
purchased; O
but O
all O
the O
new O
portion O
is O
almost O
tenantless; O
the O
tombs, O
as O
heretofore, O
continue O
to O
crowd O
together O
towards O
the O
gate. O
The O
keeper, O
who O
is O
at O
once O
gravedigger O
and O
church O
beadle O
(thus O
making O
a O
double O
profit O
out O
of O
the O
parish O
corpses), O
has O
taken O
advantage O
of O
the O
unused O
plot O
of O
ground O
to O
plant O
potatoes O
there. O
From O
year O
to O
year, O
however, O
his O
small O
field O
grows O
smaller, O
and O
when O
there O
is O
an O
epidemic, O
he O
does O
not O
know O
whether O
to O
rejoice O
at O
the O
deaths O
or O
regret O
the O
burials. O
"You O
live O
on O
the O
dead, O
Lestiboudois!" O
the O
curie O
at O
last O
said O
to O
him O
one O
day. O
This O
grim O
remark O
made O
him O
reflect; O
it O
checked O
him O
for O
some O
time; O
but O
to O
this O
day O
he O
carries O
on O
the O
cultivation O
of O
his O
little O
tubers, O
and O
even O
maintains O
stoutly O
that O
they O
grow O
naturally. O
Since O
the O
events O
about O
to O
be O
narrated, O
nothing O
in O
fact O
has O
changed O
at O
Yonville. O
The O
tin O
tricolour O
flag O
still O
swings O
at O
the O
top O
of O
the O
church-steeple; O
the O
two O
chintz O
streamers O
still O
flutter O
in O
the O
wind O
from O
the O
linen-draper's; O
the O
chemist's O
fetuses, O
like O
lumps O
of O
white O
amadou, O
rot O
more O
and O
more O
in O
their O
turbid O
alcohol, O
and O
above O
the O
big O
door O
of O
the O
inn O
the O
old O
golden O
lion, O
faded O
by O
rain, O
still O
shows O
passers-by O
its O
poodle O
mane. O
On O
the O
evening O
when O
the O
Bovarys O
were O
to O
arrive O
at O
Yonville, O
Widow O
Lefrancois, O
the O
landlady O
of O
this O
inn, O
was O
so O
very O
busy O
that O
she O
sweated O
great O
drops O
as O
she O
moved O
her O
saucepans. O
To-morrow O
was O
market-day. O
The O
meat O
had O
to O
be O
cut O
beforehand, O
the O
fowls O
drawn, O
the O
soup O
and O
coffee O
made. O
Moreover, O
she O
had O
the O
boarders' O
meal O
to O
see O
to, O
and O
that O
of O
the O
doctor, O
his O
wife, O
and O
their O
servant; O
the O
billiard-room O
was O
echoing O
with O
bursts O
of O
laughter; O
three O
millers O
in O
a O
small O
parlour O
were O
calling O
for O
brandy; O
the O
wood O
was O
blazing, O
the O
brazen O
pan O
was O
hissing, O
and O
on O
the O
long O
kitchen O
table, O
amid O
the O
quarters O
of O
raw O
mutton, O
rose O
piles O
of O
plates O
that O
rattled O
with O
the O
shaking O
of O
the O
block O
on O
which O
spinach O
was O
being O
chopped. O
From O
the O
poultry-yard O
was O
heard O
the O
screaming O
of O
the O
fowls O
whom O
the O
servant O
was O
chasing O
in O
order O
to O
wring O
their O
necks. O
A O
man O
slightly O
marked O
with O
small-pox, O
in O
green O
leather O
slippers, O
and O
wearing O
a O
velvet O
cap O
with O
a O
gold O
tassel, O
was O
warming O
his O
back O
at O
the O
chimney. O
His O
face O
expressed O
nothing O
but O
self-satisfaction, O
and O
he O
appeared O
to O
take O
life O
as O
calmly O
as O
the O
goldfinch O
suspended O
over O
his O
head O
in O
its O
wicker O
cage: O
this O
was O
the O
chemist. O
"Artemise!" O
shouted O
the O
landlady, O
"chop O
some O
wood, O
fill O
the O
water O
bottles, O
bring O
some O
brandy, O
look O
sharp! O
If O
only O
I O
knew O
what O
dessert O
to O
offer O
the O
guests O
you O
are O
expecting! O
Good O
heavens! O
Those O
furniture-movers O
are O
beginning O
their O
racket O
in O
the O
billiard-room O
again; O
and O
their O
van O
has O
been O
left O
before O
the O
front O
door! O
The O
'Hirondelle' O
might O
run O
into O
it O
when O
it O
draws O
up. O
Call O
Polyte O
and O
tell O
him O
to O
put O
it O
up. O
Only O
think, O
Monsieur O
Homais, O
that O
since O
morning O
they O
have O
had O
about O
fifteen O
games, O
and O
drunk O
eight O
jars O
of O
cider! O
Why, O
they'll O
tear O
my O
cloth O
for O
me," O
she O
went O
on, O
looking O
at O
them O
from O
a O
distance, O
her O
strainer O
in O
her O
hand. O
"That O
wouldn't O
be O
much O
of O
a O
loss," O
replied O
Monsieur O
Homais. O
"You O
would O
buy O
another." O
"Another O
billiard-table!" O
exclaimed O
the O
widow. O
"Since O
that O
one O
is O
coming O
to O
pieces, O
Madame O
Lefrancois. O
I O
tell O
you O
again O
you O
are O
doing O
yourself O
harm, O
much O
harm! O
And O
besides, O
players O
now O
want O
narrow O
pockets O
and O
heavy O
cues. O
Hazards O
aren't O
played O
now; O
everything O
is O
changed! O
One O
must O
keep O
pace O
with O
the O
times! O
Just O
look O
at O
Tellier!" O
The O
hostess O
reddened O
with O
vexation. O
The O
chemist O
went O
on-- O
"You O
may O
say O
what O
you O
like; O
his O
table O
is O
better O
than O
yours; O
and O
if O
one O
were O
to O
think, O
for O
example, O
of O
getting O
up O
a O
patriotic O
pool O
for O
Poland O
or O
the O
sufferers O
from O
the O
Lyons O
floods O
-- O
" O
"It O
isn't O
beggars O
like O
him O
that'll O
frighten O
us," O
interrupted O
the O
landlady, O
shrugging O
her O
fat O
shoulders. O
"Come, O
come, O
Monsieur O
Homais; O
as O
long O
as O
the O
'Lion O
d'Or' O
exists O
people O
will O
come O
to O
it. O
We've O
feathered O
our O
nest; O
while O
one O
of O
these O
days O
you'll O
find O
the O
'Cafe O
Francais' O
closed O
with O
a O
big O
placard O
on O
the O
shutters. O
Change O
my O
billiard-table!" O
she O
went O
on, O
speaking O
to O
herself, O
"the O
table O
that O
comes O
in O
so O
handy O
for O
folding O
the O
washing, O
and O
on O
which, O
in O
the O
hunting O
season, O
I O
have O
slept O
six O
visitors! O
But O
that O
dawdler, O
Hivert, O
doesn't O
come!" O
"Are O
you O
waiting O
for O
him O
for O
your O
gentlemen's O
dinner?" O
"Wait O
for O
him! O
And O
what O
about O
Monsieur O
Binet? O
As O
the O
clock O
strikes O
six O
you'll O
see O
him O
come O
in, O
for O
he O
hasn't O
his O
equal O
under O
the O
sun O
for O
punctuality. O
He O
must O
always O
have O
his O
seat O
in O
the O
small O
parlour. O
He'd O
rather O
die O
than O
dine O
anywhere O
else. O
And O
so O
squeamish O
as O
he O
is, O
and O
so O
particular O
about O
the O
cider! O
Not O
like O
Monsieur O
Leon; O
he O
sometimes O
comes O
at O
seven, O
or O
even O
half-past, O
and O
he O
doesn't O
so O
much O
as O
look O
at O
what O
he O
eats. O
Such O
a O
nice O
young O
man! O
Never O
speaks O
a O
rough O
word!" O
"Well, O
you O
see, O
there's O
a O
great O
difference O
between O
an O
educated O
man O
and O
an O
old O
carabineer O
who O
is O
now O
a O
tax-collector." O
Six O
o'clock O
struck. O
Binet O
came O
in. O
He O
wore O
a O
blue O
frock-coat O
falling O
in O
a O
straight O
line O
round O
his O
thin O
body, O
and O
his O
leather O
cap, O
with O
its O
lappets O
knotted O
over O
the O
top O
of O
his O
head O
with O
string, O
showed O
under O
the O
turned-up O
peak O
a O
bald O
forehead, O
flattened O
by O
the O
constant O
wearing O
of O
a O
helmet. O
He O
wore O
a O
black O
cloth O
waistcoat, O
a O
hair O
collar, O
grey O
trousers, O
and, O
all O
the O
year O
round, O
well-blacked O
boots, O
that O
had O
two O
parallel O
swellings O
due O
to O
the O
sticking O
out O
of O
his O
big-toes. O
Not O
a O
hair O
stood O
out O
from O
the O
regular O
line O
of O
fair O
whiskers, O
which, O
encircling O
his O
jaws, O
framed, O
after O
the O
fashion O
of O
a O
garden O
border, O
his O
long, O
wan O
face, O
whose O
eyes O
were O
small O
and O
the O
nose O
hooked. O
Clever O
at O
all O
games O
of O
cards, O
a O
good O
hunter, O
and O
writing O
a O
fine O
hand, O
he O
had O
at O
home O
a O
lathe, O
and O
amused O
himself O
by O
turning O
napkin O
rings, O
with O
which O
he O
filled O
up O
his O
house, O
with O
the O
jealousy O
of O
an O
artist O
and O
the O
egotism O
of O
a O
bourgeois. O
He O
went O
to O
the O
small O
parlour, O
but O
the O
three O
millers O
had O
to O
be O
got O
out O
first, O
and O
during O
the O
whole O
time O
necessary O
for O
laying O
the O
cloth, O
Binet O
remained O
silent O
in O
his O
place O
near O
the O
stove. O
Then O
he O
shut O
the O
door O
and O
took O
off O
his O
cap O
in O
his O
usual O
way. O
"It O
isn't O
with O
saying O
civil O
things O
that O
he'll O
wear O
out O
his O
tongue," O
said O
the O
chemist, O
as O
soon O
as O
he O
was O
along O
with O
the O
landlady. O
"He O
never O
talks O
more," O
she O
replied. O
"Last O
week O
two O
travelers O
in O
the O
cloth O
line O
were O
here-- O
such O
clever O
chaps O
who O
told O
such O
jokes O
in O
the O
evening, O
that O
I O
fairly O
cried O
with O
laughing; O
and O
he O
stood O
there O
like O
a O
dab O
fish O
and O
never O
said O
a O
word." O
"Yes," O
observed O
the O
chemist; O
"no O
imagination, O
no O
sallies, O
nothing O
that O
makes O
the O
society-man." O
"Yet O
they O
say O
he O
has O
parts," O
objected O
the O
landlady. O
"Parts!" O
replied O
Monsieur O
Homais; O
"he, O
parts! O
In O
his O
own O
line O
it O
is O
possible," O
he O
added O
in O
a O
calmer O
tone. O
And O
he O
went O
on-- O
"Ah! O
That O
a O
merchant, O
who O
has O
large O
connections, O
a O
jurisconsult, O
a O
doctor, O
a O
chemist, O
should O
be O
thus O
absent-minded, O
that O
they O
should O
become O
whimsical O
or O
even O
peevish, O
I O
can O
understand; O
such O
cases O
are O
cited O
in O
history. O
But O
at O
least O
it O
is O
because O
they O
are O
thinking O
of O
something. O
Myself, O
for O
example, O
how O
often O
has O
it O
happened O
to O
me O
to O
look O
on O
the O
bureau O
for O
my O
pen O
to O
write O
a O
label, O
and O
to O
find, O
after O
all, O
that O
I O
had O
put O
it O
behind O
my O
ear!" O
Madame O
Lefrancois O
just O
then O
went O
to O
the O
door O
to O
see O
if O
the O
"Hirondelle" O
were O
not O
coming. O
She O
started. O
A O
man O
dressed O
in O
black O
suddenly O
came O
into O
the O
kitchen. O
By O
the O
last O
gleam O
of O
the O
twilight O
one O
could O
see O
that O
his O
face O
was O
rubicund O
and O
his O
form O
athletic. O
"What O
can O
I O
do O
for O
you, O
Monsieur O
le O
Curie?" O
asked O
the O
landlady, O
as O
she O
reached O
down O
from O
the O
chimney O
one O
of O
the O
copper O
candlesticks O
placed O
with O
their O
candles O
in O
a O
row. O
"Will O
you O
take O
something? O
A O
thimbleful O
of O
Cassis? O
A O
glass O
of O
wine?" O
BLACK O
CURRANT O
LIQUEUR. O
The O
priest O
declined O
very O
politely. O
He O
had O
come O
for O
his O
umbrella, O
that O
he O
had O
forgotten O
the O
other O
day O
at O
the O
Ernemont O
convent, O
and O
after O
asking O
Madame O
Lefrancois O
to O
have O
it O
sent O
to O
him O
at O
the O
presbytery O
in O
the O
evening, O
he O
left O
for O
the O
church, O
from O
which O
the O
Angelus O
was O
ringing. O
When O
the O
chemist O
no O
longer O
heard O
the O
noise O
of O
his O
boots O
along O
the O
square, O
he O
thought O
the O
priest's O
behaviour O
just O
now O
very O
unbecoming. O
This O
refusal O
to O
take O
any O
refreshment O
seemed O
to O
him O
the O
most O
odious O
hypocrisy; O
all O
priests O
tippled O
on O
the O
sly, O
and O
were O
trying O
to O
bring O
back O
the O
days O
of O
the O
tithe. O
The O
landlady O
took O
up O
the O
defence O
of O
her O
curie. O
"Besides, O
he O
could O
double O
up O
four O
men O
like O
you O
over O
his O
knee. O
Last O
year O
he O
helped O
our O
people O
to O
bring O
in O
the O
straw; O
he O
carried O
as O
many O
as O
six O
trusses O
at O
once, O
he O
is O
so O
strong." O
"Bravo!" O
said O
the O
chemist. O
"Now O
just O
send O
your O
daughters O
to O
confess O
to O
fellows O
which O
such O
a O
temperament! O
I, O
if O
I O
were O
the O
Government, O
I'd O
have O
the O
priests O
bled O
once O
a O
month. O
Yes, O
Madame O
Lefrancois, O
every O
month O
-- O
a O
good O
phlebotomy, O
in O
the O
interests O
of O
the O
police O
and O
morals." O
"Be O
quiet, O
Monsieur O
Homais. O
You O
are O
an O
infidel; O
you've O
no O
religion." O
The O
chemist O
answered: O
"I O
have O
a O
religion, O
my O
religion, O
and O
I O
even O
have O
more O
than O
all O
these O
others O
with O
their O
mummeries O
and O
their O
juggling. O
I O
adore O
God, O
on O
the O
contrary. O
I O
believe O
in O
the O
Supreme O
Being, O
in O
a O
Creator, O
whatever O
he O
may O
be. O
I O
care O
little O
who O
has O
placed O
us O
here O
below O
to O
fulfil O
our O
duties O
as O
citizens O
and O
fathers O
of O
families; O
but O
I O
don't O
need O
to O
go O
to O
church O
to O
kiss O
silver O
plates, O
and O
fatten, O
out O
of O
my O
pocket, O
a O
lot O
of O
good-for-nothings O
who O
live O
better O
than O
we O
do. O
For O
one O
can O
know O
Him O
as O
well O
in O
a O
wood, O
in O
a O
field, O
or O
even O
contemplating O
the O
eternal O
vault O
like O
the O
ancients. O
My O
God! O
Mine O
is O
the O
God O
of O
Socrates, O
of O
Franklin, O
of O
Voltaire, O
and O
of O
Beranger! O
I O
am O
for O
the O
profession O
of O
faith O
of O
the O
'Savoyard O
Vicar,' O
and O
the O
immortal O
principles O
of O
'89! O
And O
I O
can't O
admit O
of O
an O
old O
boy O
of O
a O
God O
who O
takes O
walks O
in O
his O
garden O
with O
a O
cane O
in O
his O
hand, O
who O
lodges O
his O
friends O
in O
the O
belly O
of O
whales, O
dies O
uttering O
a O
cry, O
and O
rises O
again O
at O
the O
end O
of O
three O
days; O
things O
absurd O
in O
themselves, O
and O
completely O
opposed, O
moreover, O
to O
all O
physical O
laws, O
which O
prove O
to O
us, O
by O
the O
way, O
that O
priests O
have O
always O
wallowed O
in O
turpid O
ignorance, O
in O
which O
they O
would O
fain O
engulf O
the O
people O
with O
them." O
He O
ceased, O
looking O
round O
for O
an O
audience, O
for O
in O
his O
bubbling O
over O
the O
chemist O
had O
for O
a O
moment O
fancied O
himself O
in O
the O
midst O
of O
the O
town O
council. O
But O
the O
landlady O
no O
longer O
heeded O
him; O
she O
was O
listening O
to O
a O
distant O
rolling. O
One O
could O
distinguish O
the O
noise O
of O
a O
carriage O
mingled O
with O
the O
clattering O
of O
loose O
horseshoes O
that O
beat O
against O
the O
ground, O
and O
at O
last O
the O
"Hirondelle" O
stopped O
at O
the O
door. O
It O
was O
a O
yellow O
box O
on O
two O
large O
wheels, O
that, O
reaching O
to O
the O
tilt, O
prevented O
travelers O
from O
seeing O
the O
road O
and O
dirtied O
their O
shoulders. O
The O
small O
panes O
of O
the O
narrow O
windows O
rattled O
in O
their O
sashes O
when O
the O
coach O
was O
closed, O
and O
retained O
here O
and O
there O
patches O
of O
mud O
amid O
the O
old O
layers O
of O
dust, O
that O
not O
even O
storms O
of O
rain O
had O
altogether O
washed O
away. O
It O
was O
drawn O
by O
three O
horses, O
the O
first O
a O
leader, O
and O
when O
it O
came O
down-hill O
its O
bottom O
jolted O
against O
the O
ground. O
Some O
of O
the O
inhabitants O
of O
Yonville O
came O
out O
into O
the O
square; O
they O
all O
spoke O
at O
once, O
asking O
for O
news, O
for O
explanations, O
for O
hampers. O
Hivert O
did O
not O
know O
whom O
to O
answer. O
It O
was O
he O
who O
did O
the O
errands O
of O
the O
place O
in O
town. O
He O
went O
to O
the O
shops O
and O
brought O
back O
rolls O
of O
leather O
for O
the O
shoemaker, O
old O
iron O
for O
the O
farrier, O
a O
barrel O
of O
herrings O
for O
his O
mistress, O
caps O
from O
the O
milliner's, O
locks O
from O
the O
hair-dresser's O
and O
all O
along O
the O
road O
on O
his O
return O
journey O
he O
distributed O
his O
parcels, O
which O
he O
threw, O
standing O
upright O
on O
his O
seat O
and O
shouting O
at O
the O
top O
of O
his O
voice, O
over O
the O
enclosures O
of O
the O
yards. O
An O
accident O
had O
delayed O
him. O
Madame O
Bovary's O
greyhound O
had O
run O
across O
the O
field. O
They O
had O
whistled O
for O
him O
a O
quarter O
of O
an O
hour; O
Hivert O
had O
even O
gone O
back O
a O
mile O
and O
a O
half O
expecting O
every O
moment O
to O
catch O
sight O
of O
her; O
but O
it O
had O
been O
necessary O
to O
go O
on. O
Emma O
had O
wept, O
grown O
angry; O
she O
had O
accused O
Charles O
of O
this O
misfortune. O
Monsieur O
Lheureux, O
a O
draper, O
who O
happened O
to O
be O
in O
the O
coach O
with O
her, O
had O
tried O
to O
console O
her O
by O
a O
number O
of O
examples O
of O
lost O
dogs O
recognizing O
their O
masters O
at O
the O
end O
of O
long O
years. O
One, O
he O
said O
had O
been O
told O
of, O
who O
had O
come O
back O
to O
Paris O
from O
Constantinople. O
Another O
had O
gone O
one O
hundred O
and O
fifty O
miles O
in O
a O
straight O
line, O
and O
swum O
four O
rivers; O
and O
his O
own O
father O
had O
possessed O
a O
poodle, O
which, O
after O
twelve O
years O
of O
absence, O
had O
all O
of O
a O
sudden O
jumped O
on O
his O
back O
in O
the O
street O
as O
he O
was O
going O
to O
dine O
in O
town. O
CHAPTER O
TWO O
Emma O
got O
out O
first, O
then O
Felicite, O
Monsieur O
Lheureux, O
and O
a O
nurse, O
and O
they O
had O
to O
wake O
up O
Charles O
in O
his O
corner, O
where O
he O
had O
slept O
soundly O
since O
night O
set O
in. O
Homais O
introduced O
himself; O
he O
offered O
his O
homages O
to O
madame O
and O
his O
respects O
to O
monsieur; O
said O
he O
was O
charmed O
to O
have O
been O
able O
to O
render O
them O
some O
slight O
service, O
and O
added O
with O
a O
cordial O
air O
that O
he O
had O
ventured O
to O
invite O
himself, O
his O
wife O
being O
away. O
When O
Madame O
Bovary O
was O
in O
the O
kitchen O
she O
went O
up O
to O
the O
chimney. O
With O
the O
tips O
of O
her O
fingers O
she O
caught O
her O
dress O
at O
the O
knee, O
and O
having O
thus O
pulled O
it O
up O
to O
her O
ankle, O
held O
out O
her O
foot O
in O
its O
black O
boot O
to O
the O
fire O
above O
the O
revolving O
leg O
of O
mutton. O
The O
flame O
lit O
up O
the O
whole O
of O
her, O
penetrating O
with O
a O
crude O
light O
the O
woof O
of O
her O
gowns, O
the O
fine O
pores O
of O
her O
fair O
skin, O
and O
even O
her O
eyelids, O
which O
she O
blinked O
now O
and O
again. O
A O
great O
red O
glow O
passed O
over O
her O
with O
the O
blowing O
of O
the O
wind O
through O
the O
half-open O
door. O
On O
the O
other O
side O
of O
the O
chimney O
a O
young O
man O
with O
fair O
hair O
watched O
her O
silently. O
As O
he O
was O
a O
good O
deal O
bored O
at O
Yonville, O
where O
he O
was O
a O
clerk O
at O
the O
notary's, O
Monsieur O
Guillaumin, O
Monsieur O
Leon O
Dupuis O
(it O
was O
he O
who O
was O
the O
second O
habitue O
of O
the O
"Lion O
d'Or") O
frequently O
put O
back O
his O
dinner-hour O
in O
hope O
that O
some O
traveler O
might O
come O
to O
the O
inn, O
with O
whom O
he O
could O
chat O
in O
the O
evening. O
On O
the O
days O
when O
his O
work O
was O
done O
early, O
he O
had, O
for O
want O
of O
something O
else O
to O
do, O
to O
come O
punctually, O
and O
endure O
from O
soup O
to O
cheese O
a O
tete-a-tete O
with O
Binet. O
It O
was O
therefore O
with O
delight O
that O
he O
accepted O
the O
landlady's O
suggestion O
that O
he O
should O
dine O
in O
company O
with O
the O
newcomers, O
and O
they O
passed O
into O
the O
large O
parlour O
where O
Madame O
Lefrancois, O
for O
the O
purpose O
of O
showing O
off, O
had O
had O
the O
table O
laid O
for O
four. O
Homais O
asked O
to O
be O
allowed O
to O
keep O
on O
his O
skull-cap, O
for O
fear O
of O
coryza; O
then, O
turning O
to O
his O
neighbour-- O
"Madame O
is O
no O
doubt O
a O
little O
fatigued; O
one O
gets O
jolted O
so O
abominably O
in O
our O
'Hirondelle.'" O
"That O
is O
true," O
replied O
Emma; O
"but O
moving O
about O
always O
amuses O
me. O
I O
like O
change O
of O
place." O
"It O
is O
so O
tedious," O
sighed O
the O
clerk, O
"to O
be O
always O
riveted O
to O
the O
same O
places." O
"If O
you O
were O
like O
me," O
said O
Charles, O
"constantly O
obliged O
to O
be O
in O
the O
saddle"-- O
"But," O
Leon O
went O
on, O
addressing O
himself O
to O
Madame O
Bovary, O
"nothing, O
it O
seems O
to O
me, O
is O
more O
pleasant-- O
when O
one O
can," O
he O
added. O
"Moreover," O
said O
the O
druggist, O
"the O
practice O
of O
medicine O
is O
not O
very O
hard O
work O
in O
our O
part O
of O
the O
world, O
for O
the O
state O
of O
our O
roads O
allows O
us O
the O
use O
of O
gigs, O
and O
generally, O
as O
the O
farmers O
are O
prosperous, O
they O
pay O
pretty O
well. O
We O
have, O
medically O
speaking, O
besides O
the O
ordinary O
cases O
of O
enteritis, O
bronchitis, O
bilious O
affections, O
etc., O
now O
and O
then O
a O
few O
intermittent O
fevers O
at O
harvest-time; O
but O
on O
the O
whole, O
little O
of O
a O
serious O
nature, O
nothing O
special O
to O
note, O
unless O
it O
be O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
scrofula, O
due, O
no O
doubt, O
to O
the O
deplorable O
hygienic O
conditions O
of O
our O
peasant O
dwellings. O
Ah! O
you O
will O
find O
many O
prejudices O
to O
combat, O
Monsieur O
Bovary, O
much O
obstinacy O
of O
routine, O
with O
which O
all O
the O
efforts O
of O
your O
science O
will O
daily O
come O
into O
collision; O
for O
people O
still O
have O
recourse O
to O
novenas, O
to O
relics, O
to O
the O
priest, O
rather O
than O
come O
straight O
to O
the O
doctor O
or O
the O
chemist. O
The O
climate, O
however, O
is O
not, O
truth O
to O
tell, O
bad, O
and O
we O
even O
have O
a O
few O
nonagenarians O
in O
our O
parish. O
The O
thermometer O
(I O
have O
made O
some O
observations) O
falls O
in O
winter O
to O
4 O
degrees O
Centigrade O
at O
the O
outside, O
which O
gives O
us O
24 O
degrees O
Reaumur O
as O
the O
maximum, O
or O
otherwise O
54 O
degrees O
Fahrenheit O
(English O
scale), O
not O
more. O
And, O
as O
a O
matter O
of O
fact, O
we O
are O
sheltered O
from O
the O
north O
winds O
by O
the O
forest O
of O
Argueil O
on O
the O
one O
side, O
from O
the O
west O
winds O
by O
the O
St. O
Jean O
range O
on O
the O
other; O
and O
this O
heat, O
moreover, O
which, O
on O
account O
of O
the O
aqueous O
vapours O
given O
off O
by O
the O
river O
and O
the O
considerable O
number O
of O
cattle O
in O
the O
fields, O
which, O
as O
you O
know, O
exhale O
much O
ammonia, O
that O
is O
to O
say, O
nitrogen, O
hydrogen O
and O
oxygen O
(no, O
nitrogen O
and O
hydrogen O
alone), O
and O
which O
sucking O
up O
into O
itself O
the O
humus O
from O
the O
ground, O
mixing O
together O
all O
those O
different O
emanations, O
unites O
them O
into O
a O
stack, O
so O
to O
say, O
and O
combining O
with O
the O
electricity O
diffused O
through O
the O
atmosphere, O
when O
there O
is O
any, O
might O
in O
the O
long O
run, O
as O
in O
tropical O
countries, O
engender O
insalubrious O
miasmata-- O
this O
heat, O
I O
say, O
finds O
itself O
perfectly O
tempered O
on O
the O
side O
whence O
it O
comes, O
or O
rather O
whence O
it O
should O
come-- O
that O
is O
to O
say, O
the O
southern O
side-- O
by O
the O
south-eastern O
winds, O
which, O
having O
cooled O
themselves O
passing O
over O
the O
Seine, O
reach O
us O
sometimes O
all O
at O
once O
like O
breezes O
from O
Russia." O
"At O
any O
rate, O
you O
have O
some O
walks O
in O
the O
neighbourhood?" O
continued O
Madame O
Bovary, O
speaking O
to O
the O
young O
man. O
"Oh, O
very O
few," O
he O
answered. O
"There O
is O
a O
place O
they O
call O
La O
Pature, O
on O
the O
top O
of O
the O
hill, O
on O
the O
edge O
of O
the O
forest. O
Sometimes, O
on O
Sundays, O
I O
go O
and O
stay O
there O
with O
a O
book, O
watching O
the O
sunset." O
"I O
think O
there O
is O
nothing O
so O
admirable O
as O
sunsets," O
she O
resumed; O
"but O
especially O
by O
the O
side O
of O
the O
sea." O
"Oh, O
I O
adore O
the O
sea!" O
said O
Monsieur O
Leon. O
"And O
then, O
does O
it O
not O
seem O
to O
you," O
continued O
Madame O
Bovary, O
"that O
the O
mind O
travels O
more O
freely O
on O
this O
limitless O
expanse, O
the O
contemplation O
of O
which O
elevates O
the O
soul, O
gives O
ideas O
of O
the O
infinite, O
the O
ideal?" O
"It O
is O
the O
same O
with O
mountainous O
landscapes," O
continued O
Leon. O
"A O
cousin O
of O
mine O
who O
travelled O
in O
Switzerland O
last O
year O
told O
me O
that O
one O
could O
not O
picture O
to O
oneself O
the O
poetry O
of O
the O
lakes, O
the O
charm O
of O
the O
waterfalls, O
the O
gigantic O
effect O
of O
the O
glaciers. O
One O
sees O
pines O
of O
incredible O
size O
across O
torrents, O
cottages O
suspended O
over O
precipices, O
and, O
a O
thousand O
feet O
below O
one, O
whole O
valleys O
when O
the O
clouds O
open. O
Such O
spectacles O
must O
stir O
to O
enthusiasm, O
incline O
to O
prayer, O
to O
ecstasy; O
and O
I O
no O
longer O
marvel O
at O
that O
celebrated O
musician O
who, O
the O
better O
to O
inspire O
his O
imagination, O
was O
in O
the O
habit O
of O
playing O
the O
piano O
before O
some O
imposing O
site." O
"You O
play?" O
she O
asked. O
"No, O
but O
I O
am O
very O
fond O
of O
music," O
he O
replied. O
"Ah! O
don't O
you O
listen O
to O
him, O
Madame O
Bovary," O
interrupted O
Homais, O
bending O
over O
his O
plate. O
"That's O
sheer O
modesty. O
Why, O
my O
dear O
fellow, O
the O
other O
day O
in O
your O
room O
you O
were O
singing O
'L'Ange O
Gardien' O
ravishingly. O
I O
heard O
you O
from O
the O
laboratory. O
You O
gave O
it O
like O
an O
actor." O
Leon, O
in O
fact, O
lodged O
at O
the O
chemist's O
where O
he O
had O
a O
small O
room O
on O
the O
second O
floor, O
overlooking O
the O
Place. O
He O
blushed O
at O
the O
compliment O
of O
his O
landlord, O
who O
had O
already O
turned O
to O
the O
doctor, O
and O
was O
enumerating O
to O
him, O
one O
after O
the O
other, O
all O
the O
principal O
inhabitants O
of O
Yonville. O
He O
was O
telling O
anecdotes, O
giving O
information; O
the O
fortune O
of O
the O
notary O
was O
not O
known O
exactly, O
and O
"there O
was O
the O
Tuvache O
household," O
who O
made O
a O
good O
deal O
of O
show. O
Emma O
continued, O
"And O
what O
music O
do O
you O
prefer?" O
"Oh, O
German O
music; O
that O
which O
makes O
you O
dream." O
"Have O
you O
been O
to O
the O
opera?" O
"Not O
yet; O
but O
I O
shall O
go O
next O
year, O
when O
I O
am O
living O
at O
Paris O
to O
finish O
reading O
for O
the O
bar." O
"As O
I O
had O
the O
honour O
of O
putting O
it O
to O
your O
husband," O
said O
the O
chemist, O
"with O
regard O
to O
this O
poor O
Yanoda O
who O
has O
run O
away, O
you O
will O
find O
yourself, O
thanks O
to O
his O
extravagance, O
in O
the O
possession O
of O
one O
of O
the O
most O
comfortable O
houses O
of O
Yonville. O
Its O
greatest O
convenience O
for O
a O
doctor O
is O
a O
door O
giving O
on O
the O
Walk, O
where O
one O
can O
go O
in O
and O
out O
unseen. O
Moreover, O
it O
contains O
everything O
that O
is O
agreeable O
in O
a O
household O
-- O
a O
laundry, O
kitchen O
with O
offices, O
sitting-room, O
fruit-room, O
and O
so O
on. O
He O
was O
a O
gay O
dog, O
who O
didn't O
care O
what O
he O
spent. O
At O
the O
end O
of O
the O
garden, O
by O
the O
side O
of O
the O
water, O
he O
had O
an O
arbour O
built O
just O
for O
the O
purpose O
of O
drinking O
beer O
in O
summer; O
and O
if O
madame O
is O
fond O
of O
gardening O
she O
will O
be O
able O
-- O
" O
"My O
wife O
doesn't O
care O
about O
it," O
said O
Charles; O
"although O
she O
has O
been O
advised O
to O
take O
exercise, O
she O
prefers O
always O
sitting O
in O
her O
room O
reading." O
"Like O
me," O
replied O
Leon. O
"And O
indeed, O
what O
is O
better O
than O
to O
sit O
by O
one's O
fireside O
in O
the O
evening O
with O
a O
book, O
while O
the O
wind O
beats O
against O
the O
window O
and O
the O
lamp O
is O
burning?" O
"What, O
indeed?" O
she O
said, O
fixing O
her O
large O
black O
eyes O
wide O
open O
upon O
him. O
"One O
thinks O
of O
nothing," O
he O
continued; O
"the O
hours O
slip O
by. O
Motionless O
we O
traverse O
countries O
we O
fancy O
we O
see, O
and O
your O
thought, O
blending O
with O
the O
fiction, O
playing O
with O
the O
details, O
follows O
the O
outline O
of O
the O
adventures. O
It O
mingles O
with O
the O
characters, O
and O
it O
seems O
as O
if O
it O
were O
yourself O
palpitating O
beneath O
their O
costumes." O
"That O
is O
true! O
That O
is O
true?" O
she O
said. O
"Has O
it O
ever O
happened O
to O
you," O
Leon O
went O
on, O
"to O
come O
across O
some O
vague O
idea O
of O
one's O
own O
in O
a O
book, O
some O
dim O
image O
that O
comes O
back O
to O
you O
from O
afar, O
and O
as O
the O
completest O
expression O
of O
your O
own O
slightest O
sentiment?" O
"I O
have O
experienced O
it," O
she O
replied. O
"That O
is O
why," O
he O
said, O
"I O
especially O
love O
the O
poets. O
I O
think O
verse O
more O
tender O
than O
prose, O
and O
that O
it O
moves O
far O
more O
easily O
to O
tears." O
"Still O
in O
the O
long O
run O
it O
is O
tiring," O
continued O
Emma. O
"Now O
I, O
on O
the O
contrary, O
adore O
stories O
that O
rush O
breathlessly O
along, O
that O
frighten O
one. O
I O
detest O
commonplace O
heroes O
and O
moderate O
sentiments, O
such O
as O
there O
are O
in O
nature." O
"In O
fact," O
observed O
the O
clerk, O
"these O
works, O
not O
touching O
the O
heart, O
miss, O
it O
seems O
to O
me, O
the O
true O
end O
of O
art. O
It O
is O
so O
sweet, O
amid O
all O
the O
disenchantments O
of O
life, O
to O
be O
able O
to O
dwell O
in O
thought O
upon O
noble O
characters, O
pure O
affections, O
and O
pictures O
of O
happiness. O
For O
myself, O
living O
here O
far O
from O
the O
world, O
this O
is O
my O
one O
distraction; O
but O
Yonville O
affords O
so O
few O
resources." O
"Like O
Tostes, O
no O
doubt," O
replied O
Emma; O
"and O
so O
I O
always O
subscribed O
to O
a O
lending O
library." O
"If O
madame O
will O
do O
me O
the O
honour O
of O
making O
use O
of O
it", O
said O
the O
chemist, O
who O
had O
just O
caught O
the O
last O
words, O
"I O
have O
at O
her O
disposal O
a O
library O
composed O
of O
the O
best O
authors, O
Voltaire, O
Rousseau, O
Delille, O
Walter O
Scott, O
the O
'Echo O
des O
Feuilletons'; O
and O
in O
addition O
I O
receive O
various O
periodicals, O
among O
them O
the O
'Fanal O
de O
Rouen' O
daily, O
having O
the O
advantage O
to O
be O
its O
correspondent O
for O
the O
districts O
of O
Buchy, O
Forges, O
Neufchatel, O
Yonville, O
and O
vicinity." O
For O
two O
hours O
and O
a O
half O
they O
had O
been O
at O
table; O
for O
the O
servant O
Artemis, O
carelessly O
dragging O
her O
old O
list O
slippers O
over O
the O
flags, O
brought O
one O
plate O
after O
the O
other, O
forgot O
everything, O
and O
constantly O
left O
the O
door O
of O
the O
billiard-room O
half O
open, O
so O
that O
it O
beat O
against O
the O
wall O
with O
its O
hooks. O
Unconsciously, O
Leon, O
while O
talking, O
had O
placed O
his O
foot O
on O
one O
of O
the O
bars O
of O
the O
chair O
on O
which O
Madame O
Bovary O
was O
sitting. O
She O
wore O
a O
small O
blue O
silk O
necktie, O
that O
kept O
up O
like O
a O
ruff O
a O
gauffered O
cambric O
collar, O
and O
with O
the O
movements O
of O
her O
head O
the O
lower O
part O
of O
her O
face O
gently O
sunk O
into O
the O
linen O
or O
came O
out O
from O
it. O
Thus O
side O
by O
side, O
while O
Charles O
and O
the O
chemist O
chatted, O
they O
entered O
into O
one O
of O
those O
vague O
conversations O
where O
the O
hazard O
of O
all O
that O
is O
said O
brings O
you O
back O
to O
the O
fixed O
centre O
of O
a O
common O
sympathy. O
The O
Paris O
theatres, O
titles O
of O
novels, O
new O
quadrilles, O
and O
the O
world O
they O
did O
not O
know; O
Tostes, O
where O
she O
had O
lived, O
and O
Yonville, O
where O
they O
were; O
they O
examined O
all, O
talked O
of O
everything O
till O
to O
the O
end O
of O
dinner. O
When O
coffee O
was O
served O
Felicite O
went O
away O
to O
get O
ready O
the O
room O
in O
the O
new O
house, O
and O
the O
guests O
soon O
raised O
the O
siege. O
Madame O
Lefrancois O
was O
asleep O
near O
the O
cinders, O
while O
the O
stable-boy, O
lantern O
in O
hand, O
was O
waiting O
to O
show O
Monsieur O
and O
Madame O
Bovary O
the O
way O
home. O
Bits O
of O
straw O
stuck O
in O
his O
red O
hair, O
and O
he O
limped O
with O
his O
left O
leg. O
When O
he O
had O
taken O
in O
his O
other O
hand O
the O
cure's O
umbrella, O
they O
started. O
The O
town O
was O
asleep; O
the O
pillars O
of O
the O
market O
threw O
great O
shadows; O
the O
earth O
was O
all O
grey O
as O
on O
a O
summer's O
night. O
But O
as O
the O
doctor's O
house O
was O
only O
some O
fifty O
paces O
from O
the O
inn, O
they O
had O
to O
say O
good-night O
almost O
immediately, O
and O
the O
company O
dispersed. O
As O
soon O
as O
she O
entered O
the O
passage, O
Emma O
felt O
the O
cold O
of O
the O
plaster O
fall O
about O
her O
shoulders O
like O
damp O
linen. O
The O
walls O
were O
new O
and O
the O
wooden O
stairs O
creaked. O
In O
their O
bedroom, O
on O
the O
first O
floor, O
a O
whitish O
light O
passed O
through O
the O
curtainless O
windows. O
She O
could O
catch O
glimpses O
of O
tree O
tops, O
and O
beyond, O
the O
fields, O
half-drowned O
in O
the O
fog O
that O
lay O
reeking O
in O
the O
moonlight O
along O
the O
course O
of O
the O
river. O
In O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
room, O
pell-mell, O
were O
scattered O
drawers, O
bottles, O
curtain-rods, O
gilt O
poles, O
with O
mattresses O
on O
the O
chairs O
and O
basins O
on O
the O
ground-- O
the O
two O
men O
who O
had O
brought O
the O
furniture O
had O
left O
everything O
about O
carelessly. O
This O
was O
the O
fourth O
time O
that O
she O
had O
slept O
in O
a O
strange O
place. O
The O
first O
was O
the O
day O
of O
her O
going O
to O
the O
convent; O
the O
second, O
of O
her O
arrival O
at O
Tostes; O
the O
third, O
at O
Vaubyessard; O
and O
this O
was O
the O
fourth. O
And O
each O
one O
had O
marked, O
as O
it O
were, O
the O
inauguration O
of O
a O
new O
phase O
in O
her O
life. O
She O
did O
not O
believe O
that O
things O
could O
present O
themselves O
in O
the O
same O
way O
in O
different O
places, O
and O
since O
the O
portion O
of O
her O
life O
lived O
had O
been O
bad, O
no O
doubt O
that O
which O
remained O
to O
be O
lived O
would O
be O
better. O
CHAPTER O
THREE O
The O
next O
day, O
as O
she O
was O
getting O
up, O
she O
saw O
the O
clerk O
on O
the O
Place. O
She O
had O
on O
a O
dressing-gown. O
He O
looked O
up O
and O
bowed. O
She O
nodded O
quickly O
and O
reclosed O
the O
window. O
Leon O
waited O
all O
day O
for O
six O
o'clock O
in O
the O
evening O
to O
come, O
but O
on O
going O
to O
the O
inn, O
he O
found O
no O
one O
but O
Monsieur O
Binet, O
already O
at O
table. O
The O
dinner O
of O
the O
evening O
before O
had O
been O
a O
considerable O
event O
for O
him; O
he O
had O
never O
till O
then O
talked O
for O
two O
hours O
consecutively O
to O
a O
"lady." O
How O
then O
had O
he O
been O
able O
to O
explain, O
and O
in O
such O
language, O
the O
number O
of O
things O
that O
he O
could O
not O
have O
said O
so O
well O
before? O
He O
was O
usually O
shy, O
and O
maintained O
that O
reserve O
which O
partakes O
at O
once O
of O
modesty O
and O
dissimulation. O
At O
Yonville O
he O
was O
considered O
"well-bred." O
He O
listened O
to O
the O
arguments O
of O
the O
older O
people, O
and O
did O
not O
seem O
hot O
about O
politics O
-- O
a O
remarkable O
thing O
for O
a O
young O
man. O
Then O
he O
had O
some O
accomplishments; O
he O
painted O
in O
water-colours, O
could O
read O
the O
key O
of O
G, O
and O
readily O
talked O
literature O
after O
dinner O
when O
he O
did O
not O
play O
cards. O
Monsieur O
Homais O
respected O
him O
for O
his O
education; O
Madame O
Homais O
liked O
him O
for O
his O
good-nature, O
for O
he O
often O
took O
the O
little O
Homais O
into O
the O
garden-- O
little O
brats O
who O
were O
always O
dirty, O
very O
much O
spoilt, O
and O
somewhat O
lymphatic, O
like O
their O
mother. O
Besides O
the O
servant O
to O
look O
after O
them, O
they O
had O
Justin, O
the O
chemist's O
apprentice, O
a O
second O
cousin O
of O
Monsieur O
Homais, O
who O
had O
been O
taken O
into O
the O
house O
from O
charity, O
and O
who O
was O
useful O
at O
the O
same O
time O
as O
a O
servant. O
The O
druggist O
proved O
the O
best O
of O
neighbours. O
He O
gave O
Madame O
Bovary O
information O
as O
to O
the O
trades-people, O
sent O
expressly O
for O
his O
own O
cider O
merchant, O
tasted O
the O
drink O
himself, O
and O
saw O
that O
the O
casks O
were O
properly O
placed O
in O
the O
cellar; O
he O
explained O
how O
to O
set O
about O
getting O
in O
a O
supply O
of O
butter O
cheap, O
and O
made O
an O
arrangement O
with O
Lestiboudois, O
the O
sacristan, O
who, O
besides O
his O
sacerdotal O
and O
funeral O
functions, O
looked O
after O
the O
principal O
gardens O
at O
Yonville O
by O
the O
hour O
or O
the O
year, O
according O
to O
the O
taste O
of O
the O
customers. O
The O
need O
of O
looking O
after O
others O
was O
not O
the O
only O
thing O
that O
urged O
the O
chemist O
to O
such O
obsequious O
cordiality; O
there O
was O
a O
plan O
underneath O
it O
all. O
He O
had O
infringed O
the O
law O
ofDONEDET360619th O
Ventose, O
year O
xi., O
article O
I, O
which O
forbade O
all O
persons O
not O
having O
a O
diploma O
to O
practise O
medicine; O
so O
that, O
after O
certain O
anonymous O
denunciations, O
Homais O
had O
been O
summoned O
to O
Rouen O
to O
see O
the O
procurer O
of O
the O
king O
in O
his O
own O
private O
room; O
the O
magistrate O
receiving O
him O
standing O
up, O
ermine O
on O
shoulder O
and O
cap O
on O
head. O
It O
was O
in O
the O
morning, O
before O
the O
court O
opened. O
In O
the O
corridors O
one O
heard O
the O
heavy O
boots O
of O
the O
gendarmes O
walking O
past, O
and O
like O
a O
far-off O
noise O
great O
locks O
that O
were O
shut. O
The O
druggist's O
ears O
tingled O
as O
if O
he O
were O
about O
to O
have O
an O
apoplectic O
stroke; O
he O
saw O
the O
depths O
of O
dungeons, O
his O
family O
in O
tears, O
his O
shop O
sold, O
all O
the O
jars O
dispersed; O
and O
he O
was O
obliged O
to O
enter O
a O
cafe O
and O
take O
a O
glass O
of O
rum O
and O
seltzer O
to O
recover O
his O
spirits. O
Little O
by O
little O
the O
memory O
of O
this O
reprimand O
grew O
fainter, O
and O
he O
continued, O
as O
heretofore, O
to O
give O
anodyne O
consultations O
in O
his O
back-parlour. O
But O
the O
mayor O
resented O
it, O
his O
colleagues O
were O
jealous, O
everything O
was O
to O
be O
feared; O
gaining O
over O
Monsieur O
Bovary O
by O
his O
attentions O
was O
to O
earn O
his O
gratitude, O
and O
prevent O
his O
speaking O
out O
later O
on, O
should O
he O
notice O
anything. O
So O
every O
morning O
Homais O
brought O
him O
"the O
paper," O
and O
often O
in O
the O
afternoon O
left O
his O
shop O
for O
a O
few O
moments O
to O
have O
a O
chat O
with O
the O
Doctor. O
Charles O
was O
dull: O
patients O
did O
not O
come. O
He O
remained O
seated O
for O
hours O
without O
speaking, O
went O
into O
his O
consulting O
room O
to O
sleep, O
or O
watched O
his O
wife O
sewing. O
Then O
for O
diversion O
he O
employed O
himself O
at O
home O
as O
a O
workman; O
he O
even O
tried O
to O
do O
up O
the O
attic O
with O
some O
paint O
which O
had O
been O
left O
behind O
by O
the O
painters. O
But O
money O
matters O
worried O
him. O
He O
had O
spent O
so O
much O
for O
repairs O
at O
Tostes, O
for O
madame's O
toilette, O
and O
for O
the O
moving, O
that O
the O
whole O
dowry, O
over O
three O
thousand O
crowns, O
had O
slipped O
away O
in O
two O
years. O
Then O
how O
many O
things O
had O
been O
spoilt O
or O
lost O
during O
their O
carriage O
from O
Tostes O
to O
Yonville, O
without O
counting O
the O
plaster O
cure, O
who O
falling O
out O
of O
the O
coach O
at O
an O
over-severe O
jolt, O
had O
been O
dashed O
into O
a O
thousand O
fragments O
on O
the O
pavements O
of O
Quincampoix! O
A O
pleasanter O
trouble O
came O
to O
distract O
him, O
namely, O
the O
pregnancy O
of O
his O
wife. O
As O
the O
time O
of O
her O
confinement O
approached O
he O
cherished O
her O
the O
more. O
It O
was O
another O
bond O
of O
the O
flesh O
establishing O
itself, O
and, O
as O
it O
were, O
a O
continued O
sentiment O
of O
a O
more O
complex O
union. O
When O
from O
afar O
he O
saw O
her O
languid O
walk, O
and O
her O
figure O
without O
stays O
turning O
softly O
on O
her O
hips; O
when O
opposite O
one O
another O
he O
looked O
at O
her O
at O
his O
ease, O
while O
she O
took O
tired O
poses O
in O
her O
armchair, O
then O
his O
happiness O
knew O
no O
bounds; O
he O
got O
up, O
embraced O
her, O
passed O
his O
hands O
over O
her O
face, O
called O
her O
little O
mamma, O
wanted O
to O
make O
her O
dance, O
and O
half-laughing, O
half-crying, O
uttered O
all O
kinds O
of O
caressing O
pleasantries O
that O
came O
into O
his O
head. O
The O
idea O
of O
having O
begotten O
a O
child O
delighted O
him. O
Now O
he O
wanted O
nothing. O
He O
knew O
human O
life O
from O
end O
to O
end, O
and O
he O
sat O
down O
to O
it O
with O
serenity. O
Emma O
at O
first O
felt O
a O
great O
astonishment; O
then O
was O
anxious O
to O
be O
delivered O
that O
she O
might O
know O
what O
it O
was O
to O
be O
a O
mother. O
But O
not O
being O
able O
to O
spend O
as O
much O
as O
she O
would O
have O
liked, O
to O
have O
a O
swing-bassinette O
with O
rose O
silk O
curtains, O
and O
embroidered O
caps, O
in O
a O
fit O
of O
bitterness O
she O
gave O
up O
looking O
after O
the O
trousseau, O
and O
ordered O
the O
whole O
of O
it O
from O
a O
village O
needlewoman, O
without O
choosing O
or O
discussing O
anything. O
Thus O
she O
did O
not O
amuse O
herself O
with O
those O
preparations O
that O
stimulate O
the O
tenderness O
of O
mothers, O
and O
so O
her O
affection O
was O
from O
the O
very O
outset, O
perhaps, O
to O
some O
extent O
attenuated. O
As O
Charles, O
however, O
spoke O
of O
the O
boy O
at O
every O
meal, O
she O
soon O
began O
to O
think O
of O
him O
more O
consecutively. O
She O
hoped O
for O
a O
son; O
he O
would O
be O
strong O
and O
dark; O
she O
would O
call O
him O
George; O
and O
this O
idea O
of O
having O
a O
male O
child O
was O
like O
an O
expected O
revenge O
for O
all O
her O
impotence O
in O
the O
past. O
A O
man, O
at O
least, O
is O
free; O
he O
may O
travel O
over O
passions O
and O
over O
countries, O
overcome O
obstacles, O
taste O
of O
the O
most O
far-away O
pleasures. O
But O
a O
woman O
is O
always O
hampered. O
At O
once O
inert O
and O
flexible, O
she O
has O
against O
her O
the O
weakness O
of O
the O
flesh O
and O
legal O
dependence. O
Her O
will, O
like O
the O
veil O
of O
her O
bonnet, O
held O
by O
a O
string, O
flutters O
in O
every O
wind; O
there O
is O
always O
some O
desire O
that O
draws O
her, O
some O
conventionality O
that O
restrains. O
She O
was O
confined O
on O
a O
Sunday O
at O
about O
six O
o'clock, O
as O
the O
sun O
was O
rising. O
"It O
is O
a O
girl!" O
said O
Charles. O
She O
turned O
her O
head O
away O
and O
fainted. O
Madame O
Homais, O
as O
well O
as O
Madame O
Lefrancois O
of O
the O
Lion O
d'Or, O
almost O
immediately O
came O
running O
in O
to O
embrace O
her. O
The O
chemist, O
as O
man O
of O
discretion, O
only O
offered O
a O
few O
provincial O
felicitations O
through O
the O
half-opened O
door. O
He O
wished O
to O
see O
the O
child O
and O
thought O
it O
well O
made. O
Whilst O
she O
was O
getting O
well O
she O
occupied O
herself O
much O
in O
seeking O
a O
name O
for O
her O
daughter. O
First O
she O
went O
over O
all O
those O
that O
have O
Italian O
endings, O
such O
as O
Clara, O
Louisa, O
Amanda, O
Atala; O
she O
liked O
Galsuinde O
pretty O
well, O
and O
Yseult O
or O
Leocadie O
still O
better. O
Charles O
wanted O
the O
child O
to O
be O
called O
after O
her O
mother; O
Emma O
opposed O
this. O
They O
ran O
over O
the O
calendar O
from O
end O
to O
end, O
and O
then O
consulted O
outsiders. O
"Monsieur O
Leon," O
said O
the O
chemist, O
"with O
whom O
I O
was O
talking O
about O
it O
the O
other O
day, O
wonders O
you O
do O
not O
chose O
Madeleine. O
It O
is O
very O
much O
in O
fashion O
just O
now." O
But O
Madame O
Bovary, O
senior, O
cried O
out O
loudly O
against O
this O
name O
of O
a O
sinner. O
As O
to O
Monsieur O
Homais, O
he O
had O
a O
preference O
for O
all O
those O
that O
recalled O
some O
great O
man, O
an O
illustrious O
fact, O
or O
a O
generous O
idea, O
and O
it O
was O
on O
this O
system O
that O
he O
had O
baptized O
his O
four O
children. O
Thus O
Napoleon O
represented O
glory O
and O
Franklin O
liberty; O
Irma O
was O
perhaps O
a O
concession O
to O
romanticism, O
but O
Athalie O
was O
a O
homage O
to O
the O
greatest O
masterpiece O
of O
the O
French O
stage. O
For O
his O
philosophical O
convictions O
did O
not O
interfere O
with O
his O
artistic O
tastes; O
in O
him O
the O
thinker O
did O
not O
stifle O
the O
man O
of O
sentiment; O
he O
could O
make O
distinctions, O
make O
allowances O
for O
imagination O
and O
fanaticism. O
In O
this O
tragedy, O
for O
example, O
he O
found O
fault O
with O
the O
ideas, O
but O
admired O
the O
style; O
he O
detested O
the O
conception, O
but O
applauded O
all O
the O
details, O
and O
loathed O
the O
characters O
while O
he O
grew O
enthusiastic O
over O
their O
dialogue. O
When O
he O
read O
the O
fine O
passages O
he O
was O
transported, O
but O
when O
he O
thought O
that O
mummers O
would O
get O
something O
out O
of O
them O
for O
their O
show, O
he O
was O
disconsolate; O
and O
in O
this O
confusion O
of O
sentiments O
in O
which O
he O
was O
involved O
he O
would O
have O
liked O
at O
once O
to O
crown O
Racine O
with O
both O
his O
hands O
and O
discuss O
with O
him O
for O
a O
good O
quarter O
of O
an O
hour. O
At O
last O
Emma O
remembered O
that O
at O
the O
chateau O
of O
Vaubyessard O
she O
had O
heard O
the O
Marchioness O
call O
a O
young O
lady O
Berthe; O
from O
that O
moment O
this O
name O
was O
chosen; O
and O
as O
old O
Rouault O
could O
not O
come, O
Monsieur O
Homais O
was O
requested O
to O
stand O
godfather. O
His O
gifts O
were O
all O
products O
from O
his O
establishment, O
to O
wit: O
six O
boxes O
of O
jujubes, O
a O
whole O
jar O
of O
racahout, O
three O
cakes O
of O
marshmallow O
paste, O
and O
six O
sticks O
of O
sugar-candy O
into O
the O
bargain O
that O
he O
had O
come O
across O
in O
a O
cupboard. O
On O
the O
evening O
of O
the O
ceremony O
there O
was O
a O
grand O
dinner; O
the O
cure O
was O
present; O
there O
was O
much O
excitement. O
Monsieur O
Homais O
towards O
liqueur-time O
began O
singing O
"Le O
Dieu O
des O
bonnes O
gens." O
Monsieur O
Leon O
sang O
a O
barcarolle, O
and O
Madame O
Bovary, O
senior, O
who O
was O
godmother, O
a O
romance O
of O
the O
time O
of O
the O
Empire; O
finally, O
M. O
Bovary, O
senior, O
insisted O
on O
having O
the O
child O
brought O
down, O
and O
began O
baptizing O
it O
with O
a O
glass O
of O
champagne O
that O
he O
poured O
over O
its O
head. O
This O
mockery O
of O
the O
first O
of O
the O
sacraments O
made O
the O
Abbe O
Bournisien O
angry; O
old O
Bovary O
replied O
by O
a O
quotation O
from O
"La O
Guerre O
des O
Dieux"; O
the O
cure O
wanted O
to O
leave; O
the O
ladies O
implored, O
Homais O
interfered; O
and O
they O
succeeded O
in O
making O
the O
priest O
sit O
down O
again, O
and O
he O
quietly O
went O
on O
with O
the O
half-finished O
coffee O
in O
his O
saucer. O
Monsieur O
Bovary, O
senior, O
stayed O
at O
Yonville O
a O
month, O
dazzling O
the O
natives O
by O
a O
superb O
policeman's O
cap O
with O
silver O
tassels O
that O
he O
wore O
in O
the O
morning O
when O
he O
smoked O
his O
pipe O
in O
the O
square. O
Being O
also O
in O
the O
habit O
of O
drinking O
a O
good O
deal O
of O
brandy, O
he O
often O
sent O
the O
servant O
to O
the O
Lion O
d'Or O
to O
buy O
him O
a O
bottle, O
which O
was O
put O
down O
to O
his O
son's O
account, O
and O
to O
perfume O
his O
handkerchiefs O
he O
used O
up O
his O
daughter-in-law's O
whole O
supply O
of O
eau-de-cologne. O
The O
latter O
did O
not O
at O
all O
dislike O
his O
company. O
He O
had O
knocked O
about O
the O
world, O
he O
talked O
about O
Berlin, O
Vienna, O
and O
Strasbourg, O
of O
his O
soldier O
times, O
of O
the O
mistresses O
he O
had O
had, O
the O
grand O
luncheons O
of O
which O
he O
had O
partaken; O
then O
he O
was O
amiable, O
and O
sometimes O
even, O
either O
on O
the O
stairs, O
or O
in O
the O
garden, O
would O
seize O
hold O
of O
her O
waist, O
crying, O
"Charles, O
look O
out O
for O
yourself." O
Then O
Madame O
Bovary, O
senior, O
became O
alarmed O
for O
her O
son's O
happiness, O
and O
fearing O
that O
her O
husband O
might O
in O
the O
long-run O
have O
an O
immoral O
influence O
upon O
the O
ideas O
of O
the O
young O
woman, O
took O
care O
to O
hurry O
their O
departure. O
Perhaps O
she O
had O
more O
serious O
reasons O
for O
uneasiness. O
Monsieur O
Bovary O
was O
not O
the O
man O
to O
respect O
anything. O
One O
day O
Emma O
was O
suddenly O
seized O
with O
the O
desire O
to O
see O
her O
little O
girl, O
who O
had O
been O
put O
to O
nurse O
with O
the O
carpenter's O
wife, O
and, O
without O
looking O
at O
the O
calendar O
to O
see O
whether O
the O
six O
weeks O
of O
the O
Virgin O
were O
yet O
passed, O
she O
set O
out O
for O
the O
Rollets' O
house, O
situated O
at O
the O
extreme O
end O
of O
the O
village, O
between O
the O
highroad O
and O
the O
fields. O
It O
was O
mid-day, O
the O
shutters O
of O
the O
houses O
were O
closed O
and O
the O
slate O
roofs O
that O
glittered O
beneath O
the O
fierce O
light O
of O
the O
blue O
sky O
seemed O
to O
strike O
sparks O
from O
the O
crest O
of O
the O
gables. O
A O
heavy O
wind O
was O
blowing; O
Emma O
felt O
weak O
as O
she O
walked; O
the O
stones O
of O
the O
pavement O
hurt O
her; O
she O
was O
doubtful O
whether O
she O
would O
not O
go O
home O
again, O
or O
go O
in O
somewhere O
to O
rest. O
At O
this O
moment O
Monsieur O
Leon O
came O
out O
from O
a O
neighbouring O
door O
with O
a O
bundle O
of O
papers O
under O
his O
arm. O
He O
came O
to O
greet O
her, O
and O
stood O
in O
the O
shade O
in O
front O
of O
the O
Lheureux's O
shop O
under O
the O
projecting O
grey O
awning. O
Madame O
Bovary O
said O
she O
was O
going O
to O
see O
her O
baby, O
but O
that O
she O
was O
beginning O
to O
grow O
tired. O
"If O
-- O
" O
said O
Leon, O
not O
daring O
to O
go O
on. O
"Have O
you O
any O
business O
to O
attend O
to?" O
she O
asked. O
And O
on O
the O
clerk's O
answer, O
she O
begged O
him O
to O
accompany O
her. O
That O
same O
evening O
this O
was O
known O
in O
Yonville, O
and O
Madame O
Tuvache, O
the O
mayor's O
wife, O
declared O
in O
the O
presence O
of O
her O
servant O
that O
"Madame O
Bovary O
was O
compromising O
herself." O
To O
get O
to O
the O
nurse's O
it O
was O
necessary O
to O
turn O
to O
the O
left O
on O
leaving O
the O
street, O
as O
if O
making O
for O
the O
cemetery, O
and O
to O
follow O
between O
little O
houses O
and O
yards O
a O
small O
path O
bordered O
with O
privet O
hedges. O
They O
were O
in O
bloom, O
and O
so O
were O
the O
speedwells, O
eglantines, O
thistles, O
and O
the O
sweetbriar O
that O
sprang O
up O
from O
the O
thickets. O
Through O
openings O
in O
the O
hedges O
one O
could O
see O
into O
the O
huts, O
some O
pigs O
on O
a O
dung-heap, O
or O
tethered O
cows O
rubbing O
their O
horns O
against O
the O
trunk O
of O
trees. O
The O
two, O
side O
by O
side O
walked O
slowly, O
she O
leaning O
upon O
him, O
and O
he O
restraining O
his O
pace, O
which O
he O
regulated O
by O
hers; O
in O
front O
of O
them O
a O
swarm O
of O
midges O
fluttered, O
buzzing O
in O
the O
warm O
air. O
They O
recognized O
the O
house O
by O
an O
old O
walnut-tree O
which O
shaded O
it. O
Low O
and O
covered O
with O
brown O
tiles, O
there O
hung O
outside O
it, O
beneath O
the O
dormer-window O
of O
the O
garret, O
a O
string O
of O
onions. O
Faggots O
upright O
against O
a O
thorn O
fence O
surrounded O
a O
bed O
of O
lettuce, O
a O
few O
square O
feet O
of O
lavender, O
and O
sweet O
peas O
strung O
on O
sticks. O
Dirty O
water O
was O
running O
here O
and O
there O
on O
the O
grass, O
and O
all O
round O
were O
several O
indefinite O
rags, O
knitted O
stockings, O
a O
red O
calico O
jacket, O
and O
a O
large O
sheet O
of O
coarse O
linen O
spread O
over O
the O
hedge. O
At O
the O
noise O
of O
the O
gate O
the O
nurse O
appeared O
with O
a O
baby O
she O
was O
suckling O
on O
one O
arm. O
With O
her O
other O
hand O
she O
was O
pulling O
along O
a O
poor O
puny O
little O
fellow, O
his O
face O
covered O
with O
scrofula, O
the O
son O
of O
a O
Rouen O
hosier, O
whom O
his O
parents, O
too O
taken O
up O
with O
their O
business, O
left O
in O
the O
country. O
"Go O
in," O
she O
said; O
"your O
little O
one O
is O
there O
asleep." O
The O
room O
on O
the O
ground-floor, O
the O
only O
one O
in O
the O
dwelling, O
had O
at O
its O
farther O
end, O
against O
the O
wall, O
a O
large O
bed O
without O
curtains, O
while O
a O
kneading-trough O
took O
up O
the O
side O
by O
the O
window, O
one O
pane O
of O
which O
was O
mended O
with O
a O
piece O
of O
blue O
paper. O
In O
the O
corner O
behind O
the O
door, O
shining O
hob-nailed O
shoes O
stood O
in O
a O
row O
under O
the O
slab O
of O
the O
washstand, O
near O
a O
bottle O
of O
oil O
with O
a O
feather O
stuck O
in O
its O
mouth; O
a O
Matthieu O
Laensberg O
lay O
on O
the O
dusty O
mantelpiece O
amid O
gunflints, O
candle-ends, O
and O
bits O
of O
amadou. O
Finally, O
the O
last O
luxury O
in O
the O
apartment O
was O
a O
"Fame" O
blowing O
her O
trumpets, O
a O
picture O
cut O
out, O
no O
doubt, O
from O
some O
perfumer's O
prospectus O
and O
nailed O
to O
the O
wall O
with O
six O
wooden O
shoe-pegs. O
Emma's O
child O
was O
asleep O
in O
a O
wicker-cradle. O
She O
took O
it O
up O
in O
the O
wrapping O
that O
enveloped O
it O
and O
began O
singing O
softly O
as O
she O
rocked O
herself O
to O
and O
fro. O
Leon O
walked O
up O
and O
down O
the O
room; O
it O
seemed O
strange O
to O
him O
to O
see O
this O
beautiful O
woman O
in O
her O
nankeen O
dress O
in O
the O
midst O
of O
all O
this O
poverty. O
Madam O
Bovary O
reddened; O
he O
turned O
away, O
thinking O
perhaps O
there O
had O
been O
an O
impertinent O
look O
in O
his O
eyes. O
Then O
she O
put O
back O
the O
little O
girl, O
who O
had O
just O
been O
sick O
over O
her O
collar. O
The O
nurse O
at O
once O
came O
to O
dry O
her, O
protesting O
that O
it O
wouldn't O
show. O
"She O
gives O
me O
other O
doses," O
she O
said: O
"I O
am O
always O
a-washing O
of O
her. O
If O
you O
would O
have O
the O
goodness O
to O
order O
Camus, O
the O
grocer, O
to O
let O
me O
have O
a O
little O
soap, O
it O
would O
really O
be O
more O
convenient O
for O
you, O
as O
I O
needn't O
trouble O
you O
then." O
"Very O
well! O
very O
well!" O
said O
Emma. O
"Good O
morning, O
Madame O
Rollet," O
and O
she O
went O
out, O
wiping O
her O
shoes O
at O
the O
door. O
The O
good O
woman O
accompanied O
her O
to O
the O
end O
of O
the O
garden, O
talking O
all O
the O
time O
of O
the O
trouble O
she O
had O
getting O
up O
of O
nights. O
"I'm O
that O
worn O
out O
sometimes O
as O
I O
drop O
asleep O
on O
my O
chair. O
I'm O
sure O
you O
might O
at O
least O
give O
me O
just O
a O
pound O
of O
ground O
coffee; O
that'd O
last O
me O
a O
month, O
and O
I'd O
take O
it O
of O
a O
morning O
with O
some O
milk." O
After O
having O
submitted O
to O
her O
thanks, O
Madam O
Bovary O
left. O
She O
had O
gone O
a O
little O
way O
down O
the O
path O
when, O
at O
the O
sound O
of O
wooden O
shoes, O
she O
turned O
round. O
It O
was O
the O
nurse. O
"What O
is O
it?" O
Then O
the O
peasant O
woman, O
taking O
her O
aside O
behind O
an O
elm O
tree, O
began O
talking O
to O
her O
of O
her O
husband, O
who O
with O
his O
trade O
and O
six O
francs O
a O
year O
that O
the O
captain-- O
"Oh, O
be O
quick!" O
said O
Emma. O
"Well," O
the O
nurse O
went O
on, O
heaving O
sighs O
between O
each O
word, O
"I'm O
afraid O
he'll O
be O
put O
out O
seeing O
me O
have O
coffee O
alone, O
you O
know O
men O
-- O
" O
"But O
you O
are O
to O
have O
some," O
Emma O
repeated; O
"I O
will O
give O
you O
some. O
You O
bother O
me!" O
"Oh, O
dear! O
my O
poor, O
dear O
lady! O
you O
see O
in O
consequence O
of O
his O
wounds O
he O
has O
terrible O
cramps O
in O
the O
chest. O
He O
even O
says O
that O
cider O
weakens O
him." O
"Do O
make O
haste, O
Mere O
Rollet!" O
"Well," O
the O
latter O
continued, O
making O
a O
curtsey, O
"if O
it O
weren't O
asking O
too O
much," O
and O
she O
curtsied O
once O
more, O
"if O
you O
would"-- O
and O
her O
eyes O
begged-- O
"a O
jar O
of O
brandy," O
she O
said O
at O
last, O
"and O
I'd O
rub O
your O
little O
one's O
feet O
with O
it; O
they're O
as O
tender O
as O
one's O
tongue." O
Once O
rid O
of O
the O
nurse, O
Emma O
again O
took O
Monsieur O
Leon's O
arm. O
She O
walked O
fast O
for O
some O
time, O
then O
more O
slowly, O
and O
looking O
straight O
in O
front O
of O
her, O
her O
eyes O
rested O
on O
the O
shoulder O
of O
the O
young O
man, O
whose O
frock-coat O
had O
a O
black-velvety O
collar. O
His O
brown O
hair O
fell O
over O
it, O
straight O
and O
carefully O
arranged. O
She O
noticed O
his O
nails O
which O
were O
longer O
than O
one O
wore O
them O
at O
Yonville. O
It O
was O
one O
of O
the O
clerk's O
chief O
occupations O
to O
trim O
them, O
and O
for O
this O
purpose O
he O
kept O
a O
special O
knife O
in O
his O
writing O
desk. O
They O
returned O
to O
Yonville O
by O
the O
water-side. O
In O
the O
warm O
season O
the O
bank, O
wider O
than O
at O
other O
times, O
showed O
to O
their O
foot O
the O
garden O
walls O
whence O
a O
few O
steps O
led O
to O
the O
river. O
It O
flowed O
noiselessly, O
swift, O
and O
cold O
to O
the O
eye; O
long, O
thin O
grasses O
huddled O
together O
in O
it O
as O
the O
current O
drove O
them, O
and O
spread O
themselves O
upon O
the O
limpid O
water O
like O
streaming O
hair; O
sometimes O
at O
the O
tip O
of O
the O
reeds O
or O
on O
the O
leaf O
of O
a O
water-lily O
an O
insect O
with O
fine O
legs O
crawled O
or O
rested. O
The O
sun O
pierced O
with O
a O
ray O
the O
small O
blue O
bubbles O
of O
the O
waves O
that, O
breaking, O
followed O
each O
other; O
branchless O
old O
willows O
mirrored O
their O
grey O
backs O
in O
the O
water; O
beyond, O
all O
around, O
the O
meadows O
seemed O
empty. O
It O
was O
the O
dinner-hour O
at O
the O
farms, O
and O
the O
young O
woman O
and O
her O
companion O
heard O
nothing O
as O
they O
walked O
but O
the O
fall O
of O
their O
steps O
on O
the O
earth O
of O
the O
path, O
the O
words O
they O
spoke, O
and O
the O
sound O
of O
Emma's O
dress O
rustling O
round O
her. O
The O
walls O
of O
the O
gardens O
with O
pieces O
of O
bottle O
on O
their O
coping O
were O
hot O
as O
the O
glass O
windows O
of O
a O
conservatory. O
Wallflowers O
had O
sprung O
up O
between O
the O
bricks, O
and O
with O
the O
tip O
of O
her O
open O
sunshade O
Madame O
Bovary, O
as O
she O
passed, O
made O
some O
of O
their O
faded O
flowers O
crumble O
into O
a O
yellow O
dust, O
or O
a O
spray O
of O
overhanging O
honeysuckle O
and O
clematis O
caught O
in O
its O
fringe O
and O
dangled O
for O
a O
moment O
over O
the O
silk. O
They O
were O
talking O
of O
a O
troupe O
of O
Spanish O
dancers O
who O
were O
expected O
shortly O
at O
the O
Rouen O
theatre. O
"Are O
you O
going?" O
she O
asked. O
"If O
I O
can," O
he O
answered. O
Had O
they O
nothing O
else O
to O
say O
to O
one O
another? O
Yet O
their O
eyes O
were O
full O
of O
more O
serious O
speech, O
and O
while O
they O
forced O
themselves O
to O
find O
trivial O
phrases, O
they O
felt O
the O
same O
languor O
stealing O
over O
them O
both. O
It O
was O
the O
whisper O
of O
the O
soul, O
deep, O
continuous, O
dominating O
that O
of O
their O
voices. O
Surprised O
with O
wonder O
at O
this O
strange O
sweetness, O
they O
did O
not O
think O
of O
speaking O
of O
the O
sensation O
or O
of O
seeking O
its O
cause. O
Coming O
joys, O
like O
tropical O
shores, O
throw O
over O
the O
immensity O
before O
them O
their O
inborn O
softness, O
an O
odorous O
wind, O
and O
we O
are O
lulled O
by O
this O
intoxication O
without O
a O
thought O
of O
the O
horizon O
that O
we O
do O
not O
even O
know. O
In O
one O
place O
the O
ground O
had O
been O
trodden O
down O
by O
the O
cattle; O
they O
had O
to O
step O
on O
large O
green O
stones O
put O
here O
and O
there O
in O
the O
mud. O
She O
often O
stopped O
a O
moment O
to O
look O
where O
to O
place O
her O
foot, O
and O
tottering O
on O
a O
stone O
that O
shook, O
her O
arms O
outspread, O
her O
form O
bent O
forward O
with O
a O
look O
of O
indecision, O
she O
would O
laugh, O
afraid O
of O
falling O
into O
the O
puddles O
of O
water. O
When O
they O
arrived O
in O
front O
of O
her O
garden, O
Madame O
Bovary O
opened O
the O
little O
gate, O
ran O
up O
the O
steps O
and O
disappeared. O
Leon O
returned O
to O
his O
office. O
His O
chief O
was O
away; O
he O
just O
glanced O
at O
the O
briefs, O
then O
cut O
himself O
a O
pen, O
and O
at O
last O
took O
up O
his O
hat O
and O
went O
out. O
He O
went O
to O
La O
Pature O
at O
the O
top O
of O
the O
Argueil O
hills O
at O
the O
beginning O
of O
the O
forest; O
he O
threw O
himself O
upon O
the O
ground O
under O
the O
pines O
and O
watched O
the O
sky O
through O
his O
fingers. O
"How O
bored O
I O
am!" O
he O
said O
to O
himself, O
"how O
bored O
I O
am!" O
He O
thought O
he O
was O
to O
be O
pitied O
for O
living O
in O
this O
village, O
with O
Homais O
for O
a O
friend O
and O
Monsieru O
Guillaumin O
for O
master. O
The O
latter, O
entirely O
absorbed O
by O
his O
business, O
wearing O
gold-rimmed O
spectacles O
and O
red O
whiskers O
over O
a O
white O
cravat, O
understood O
nothing O
of O
mental O
refinements, O
although O
he O
affected O
a O
stiff O
English O
manner, O
which O
in O
the O
beginning O
had O
impressed O
the O
clerk. O
As O
to O
the O
chemist's O
spouse, O
she O
was O
the O
best O
wife O
in O
Normandy, O
gentle O
as O
a O
sheep, O
loving O
her O
children, O
her O
father, O
her O
mother, O
her O
cousins, O
weeping O
for O
other's O
woes, O
letting O
everything O
go O
in O
her O
household, O
and O
detesting O
corsets; O
but O
so O
slow O
of O
movement, O
such O
a O
bore O
to O
listen O
to, O
so O
common O
in O
appearance, O
and O
of O
such O
restricted O
conversation, O
that O
although O
she O
was O
thirty, O
he O
only O
twenty, O
although O
they O
slept O
in O
rooms O
next O
each O
other O
and O
he O
spoke O
to O
her O
daily, O
he O
never O
thought O
that O
she O
might O
be O
a O
woman O
for O
another, O
or O
that O
she O
possessed O
anything O
else O
of O
her O
sex O
than O
the O
gown. O
And O
what O
else O
was O
there? O
Binet, O
a O
few O
shopkeepers, O
two O
or O
three O
publicans, O
the O
cure, O
and O
finally, O
Monsieur O
Tuvache, O
the O
mayor, O
with O
his O
two O
sons, O
rich, O
crabbed, O
obtuse O
persons, O
who O
farmed O
their O
own O
lands O
and O
had O
feasts O
among O
themselves, O
bigoted O
to O
boot, O
and O
quite O
unbearable O
companions. O
But O
from O
the O
general O
background O
of O
all O
these O
human O
faces O
Emma's O
stood O
out O
isolated O
and O
yet O
farthest O
off; O
for O
between O
her O
and O
him O
he O
seemed O
to O
see O
a O
vague O
abyss. O
In O
the O
beginning O
he O
had O
called O
on O
her O
several O
times O
along O
with O
the O
druggist. O
Charles O
had O
not O
appeared O
particularly O
anxious O
to O
see O
him O
again, O
and O
Leon O
did O
not O
know O
what O
to O
do O
between O
his O
fear O
of O
being O
indiscreet O
and O
the O
desire O
for O
an O
intimacy O
that O
seemed O
almost O
impossible. O
CHAPTER O
FOUR O
When O
the O
first O
cold O
days O
set O
in O
Emma O
left O
her O
bedroom O
for O
the O
sitting-room, O
a O
long O
apartment O
with O
a O
low O
ceiling, O
in O
which O
there O
was O
on O
the O
mantelpiece O
a O
large O
bunch O
of O
coral O
spread O
out O
against O
the O
looking-glass. O
Seated O
in O
her O
arm O
chair O
near O
the O
window, O
she O
could O
see O
the O
villagers O
pass O
along O
the O
pavement. O
Twice O
a O
day O
Leon O
went O
from O
his O
office O
to O
the O
Lion O
d'Or. O
Emma O
could O
hear O
him O
coming O
from O
afar; O
she O
leant O
forward O
listening, O
and O
the O
young O
man O
glided O
past O
the O
curtain, O
always O
dressed O
in O
the O
same O
way, O
and O
without O
turning O
his O
head. O
But O
in O
the O
twilight, O
when, O
her O
chin O
resting O
on O
her O
left O
hand, O
she O
let O
the O
embroidery O
she O
had O
begun O
fall O
on O
her O
knees, O
she O
often O
shuddered O
at O
the O
apparition O
of O
this O
shadow O
suddenly O
gliding O
past. O
She O
would O
get O
up O
and O
order O
the O
table O
to O
be O
laid. O
Monsieur O
Homais O
called O
at O
dinner-time. O
Skull-cap O
in O
hand, O
he O
came O
in O
on O
tiptoe, O
in O
order O
to O
disturb O
no O
one, O
always O
repeating O
the O
same O
phrase, O
"Good O
evening, O
everybody." O
Then, O
when O
he O
had O
taken O
his O
seat O
at O
the O
table O
between O
the O
pair, O
he O
asked O
the O
doctor O
about O
his O
patients, O
and O
the O
latter O
consulted O
his O
as O
to O
the O
probability O
of O
their O
payment. O
Next O
they O
talked O
of O
"what O
was O
in O
the O
paper." O
Homais O
by O
this O
hour O
knew O
it O
almost O
by O
heart, O
and O
he O
repeated O
it O
from O
end O
to O
end, O
with O
the O
reflections O
of O
the O
penny-a-liners, O
and O
all O
the O
stories O
of O
individual O
catastrophes O
that O
had O
occurred O
in O
France O
or O
abroad. O
But O
the O
subject O
becoming O
exhausted, O
he O
was O
not O
slow O
in O
throwing O
out O
some O
remarks O
on O
the O
dishes O
before O
him. O
Sometimes O
even, O
half-rising, O
he O
delicately O
pointed O
out O
to O
madame O
the O
tenderest O
morsel, O
or O
turning O
to O
the O
servant, O
gave O
her O
some O
advice O
on O
the O
manipulation O
of O
stews O
and O
the O
hygiene O
of O
seasoning. O
He O
talked O
aroma, O
osmazome, O
juices, O
and O
gelatine O
in O
a O
bewildering O
manner. O
Moreover, O
Homais, O
with O
his O
head O
fuller O
of O
recipes O
than O
his O
shop O
of O
jars, O
excelled O
in O
making O
all O
kinds O
of O
preserves, O
vinegars, O
and O
sweet O
liqueurs; O
he O
knew O
also O
all O
the O
latest O
inventions O
in O
economic O
stoves, O
together O
with O
the O
art O
of O
preserving O
cheese O
and O
of O
curing O
sick O
wines. O
At O
eight O
o'clock O
Justin O
came O
to O
fetch O
him O
to O
shut O
up O
the O
shop. O
Then O
Monsieur O
Homais O
gave O
him O
a O
sly O
look, O
especially O
if O
Felicite O
was O
there, O
for O
he O
half O
noticed O
that O
his O
apprentice O
was O
fond O
of O
the O
doctor's O
house. O
"The O
young O
dog," O
he O
said, O
"is O
beginning O
to O
have O
ideas, O
and O
the O
devil O
take O
me O
if O
I O
don't O
believe O
he's O
in O
love O
with O
your O
servant!" O
But O
a O
more O
serious O
fault O
with O
which O
he O
reproached O
Justin O
was O
his O
constantly O
listening O
to O
conversation. O
On O
Sunday, O
for O
example, O
one O
could O
not O
get O
him O
out O
of O
the O
drawing-room, O
whither O
Madame O
Homais O
had O
called O
him O
to O
fetch O
the O
children, O
who O
were O
falling O
asleep O
in O
the O
arm-chairs, O
and O
dragging O
down O
with O
their O
backs O
calico O
chair-covers O
that O
were O
too O
large. O
Not O
many O
people O
came O
to O
these O
soirees O
at O
the O
chemist's, O
his O
scandal-mongering O
and O
political O
opinions O
having O
successfully O
alienated O
various O
respectable O
persons O
from O
him. O
The O
clerk O
never O
failed O
to O
be O
there. O
As O
soon O
as O
he O
heard O
the O
bell O
he O
ran O
to O
meet O
Madame O
Bovary, O
took O
her O
shawl, O
and O
put O
away O
under O
the O
shop-counter O
the O
thick O
list O
shoes O
that O
she O
wore O
over O
her O
boots O
when O
there O
was O
snow. O
First O
they O
played O
some O
hands O
at O
trente-et-un; O
next O
Monsieur O
Homais O
played O
ecarte O
with O
Emma; O
Leon O
behind O
her O
gave O
her O
advice. O
Standing O
up O
with O
his O
hands O
on O
the O
back O
of O
her O
chair O
he O
saw O
the O
teeth O
of O
her O
comb O
that O
bit O
into O
her O
chignon. O
With O
every O
movement O
that O
she O
made O
to O
throw O
her O
cards O
the O
right O
side O
of O
her O
dress O
was O
drawn O
up. O
From O
her O
turned-up O
hair O
a O
dark O
colour O
fell O
over O
her O
back, O
and O
growing O
gradually O
paler, O
lost O
itself O
little O
by O
little O
in O
the O
shade. O
Then O
her O
dress O
fell O
on O
both O
sides O
of O
her O
chair, O
puffing O
out O
full O
of O
folds, O
and O
reached O
the O
ground. O
When O
Leon O
occasionally O
felt O
the O
sole O
of O
his O
boot O
resting O
on O
it, O
he O
drew O
back O
as O
if O
he O
had O
trodden O
upon O
some O
one. O
When O
the O
game O
of O
cards O
was O
over, O
the O
druggist O
and O
the O
Doctor O
played O
dominoes, O
and O
Emma, O
changing O
her O
place, O
leant O
her O
elbow O
on O
the O
table, O
turning O
over O
the O
leaves O
of O
"L'Illustration". O
She O
had O
brought O
her O
ladies' O
journal O
with O
her. O
Leon O
sat O
down O
near O
her; O
they O
looked O
at O
the O
engravings O
together, O
and O
waited O
for O
one O
another O
at O
the O
bottom O
of O
the O
pages. O
She O
often O
begged O
him O
to O
read O
her O
the O
verses; O
Leon O
declaimed O
them O
in O
a O
languid O
voice, O
to O
which O
he O
carefully O
gave O
a O
dying O
fall O
in O
the O
love O
passages. O
But O
the O
noise O
of O
the O
dominoes O
annoyed O
him. O
Monsieur O
Homais O
was O
strong O
at O
the O
game; O
he O
could O
beat O
Charles O
and O
give O
him O
a O
double-six. O
Then O
the O
three O
hundred O
finished, O
they O
both O
stretched O
themselves O
out O
in O
front O
of O
the O
fire, O
and O
were O
soon O
asleep. O
The O
fire O
was O
dying O
out O
in O
the O
cinders; O
the O
teapot O
was O
empty, O
Leon O
was O
still O
reading. O
Emma O
listened O
to O
him, O
mechanically O
turning O
around O
the O
lampshade, O
on O
the O
gauze O
of O
which O
were O
painted O
clowns O
in O
carriages, O
and O
tight-rope O
dances O
with O
their O
balancing-poles. O
Leon O
stopped, O
pointing O
with O
a O
gesture O
to O
his O
sleeping O
audience; O
then O
they O
talked O
in O
low O
tones, O
and O
their O
conversation O
seemed O
the O
more O
sweet O
to O
them O
because O
it O
was O
unheard. O
Thus O
a O
kind O
of O
bond O
was O
established O
between O
them, O
a O
constant O
commerce O
of O
books O
and O
of O
romances. O
Monsieur O
Bovary, O
little O
given O
to O
jealousy, O
did O
not O
trouble O
himself O
about O
it. O
On O
his O
birthday O
he O
received O
a O
beautiful O
phrenological O
head, O
all O
marked O
with O
figures O
to O
the O
thorax O
and O
painted O
blue. O
This O
was O
an O
attention O
of O
the O
clerk's. O
He O
showed O
him O
many O
others, O
even O
to O
doing O
errands O
for O
him O
at O
Rouen; O
and O
the O
book O
of O
a O
novelist O
having O
made O
the O
mania O
for O
cactuses O
fashionable, O
Leon O
bought O
some O
for O
Madame O
Bovary, O
bringing O
them O
back O
on O
his O
knees O
in O
the O
"Hirondelle," O
pricking O
his O
fingers O
on O
their O
hard O
hairs. O
She O
had O
a O
board O
with O
a O
balustrade O
fixed O
against O
her O
window O
to O
hold O
the O
pots. O
The O
clerk, O
too, O
had O
his O
small O
hanging O
garden; O
they O
saw O
each O
other O
tending O
their O
flowers O
at O
their O
windows. O
Of O
the O
windows O
of O
the O
village O
there O
was O
one O
yet O
more O
often O
occupied; O
for O
on O
Sundays O
from O
morning O
to O
night, O
and O
every O
morning O
when O
the O
weather O
was O
bright, O
one O
could O
see O
at O
the O
dormer-window O
of O
the O
garret O
the O
profile O
of O
Monsieur O
Binet O
bending O
over O
his O
lathe, O
whose O
monotonous O
humming O
could O
be O
heard O
at O
the O
Lion O
d'Or. O
One O
evening O
on O
coming O
home O
Leon O
found O
in O
his O
room O
a O
rug O
in O
velvet O
and O
wool O
with O
leaves O
on O
a O
pale O
ground. O
He O
called O
Madame O
Homais, O
Monsieur O
Homais, O
Justin, O
the O
children, O
the O
cook; O
he O
spoke O
of O
it O
to O
his O
chief; O
every O
one O
wanted O
to O
see O
this O
rug. O
Why O
did O
the O
doctor's O
wife O
give O
the O
clerk O
presents? O
It O
looked O
queer. O
They O
decided O
that O
she O
must O
be O
his O
lover. O
He O
made O
this O
seem O
likely, O
so O
ceaselessly O
did O
he O
talk O
of O
her O
charms O
and O
of O
her O
wit; O
so O
much O
so, O
that O
Binet O
once O
roughly O
answered O
him-- O
"What O
does O
it O
matter O
to O
me O
since O
I'm O
not O
in O
her O
set?" O
He O
tortured O
himself O
to O
find O
out O
how O
he O
could O
make O
his O
declaration O
to O
her, O
and O
always O
halting O
between O
the O
fear O
of O
displeasing O
her O
and O
the O
shame O
of O
being O
such O
a O
coward, O
he O
wept O
with O
discouragement O
and O
desire. O
Then O
he O
took O
energetic O
resolutions, O
wrote O
letters O
that O
he O
tore O
up, O
put O
it O
off O
to O
times O
that O
he O
again O
deferred. O
Often O
he O
set O
out O
with O
the O
determination O
to O
dare O
all; O
but O
this O
resolution O
soon O
deserted O
him O
in O
Emma's O
presence, O
and O
when O
Charles, O
dropping O
in, O
invited O
him O
to O
jump O
into O
his O
chaise O
to O
go O
with O
him O
to O
see O
some O
patient O
in O
the O
neighbourhood, O
he O
at O
once O
accepted, O
bowed O
to O
madame, O
and O
went O
out. O
Her O
husband, O
was O
he O
not O
something O
belonging O
to O
her? O
As O
to O
Emma, O
she O
did O
not O
ask O
herself O
whether O
she O
loved. O
Love, O
she O
thought, O
must O
come O
suddenly, O
with O
great O
outbursts O
and O
lightnings O
-- O
a O
hurricane O
of O
the O
skies, O
which O
falls O
upon O
life, O
revolutionises O
it, O
roots O
up O
the O
will O
like O
a O
leaf, O
and O
sweeps O
the O
whole O
heart O
into O
the O
abyss. O
She O
did O
not O
know O
that O
on O
the O
terrace O
of O
houses O
it O
makes O
lakes O
when O
the O
pipes O
are O
choked, O
and O
she O
would O
thus O
have O
remained O
in O
her O
security O
when O
she O
suddenly O
discovered O
a O
rent O
in O
the O
wall O
of O
it. O
CHAPTER O
FIVE O
It O
was O
a O
Sunday O
in O
February, O
an O
afternoon O
when O
the O
snow O
was O
falling. O
They O
had O
all, O
Monsieur O
and O
Madame O
Bovary, O
Homais, O
and O
Monsieur O
Leon, O
gone O
to O
see O
a O
yarn-mill O
that O
was O
being O
built O
in O
the O
valley O
a O
mile O
and O
a O
half O
from O
Yonville. O
The O
druggist O
had O
taken O
Napoleon O
and O
Athalie O
to O
give O
them O
some O
exercise, O
and O
Justin O
accompanied O
them, O
carrying O
the O
umbrellas O
on O
his O
shoulder. O
Nothing, O
however, O
could O
be O
less O
curious O
than O
this O
curiosity. O
A O
great O
piece O
of O
waste O
ground, O
on O
which O
pell-mell, O
amid O
a O
mass O
of O
sand O
and O
stones, O
were O
a O
few O
break-wheels, O
already O
rusty, O
surrounded O
by O
a O
quadrangular O
building O
pierced O
by O
a O
number O
of O
little O
windows. O
The O
building O
was O
unfinished; O
the O
sky O
could O
be O
seen O
through O
the O
joists O
of O
the O
roofing. O
Attached O
to O
the O
stop-plank O
of O
the O
gable O
a O
bunch O
of O
straw O
mixed O
with O
corn-ears O
fluttered O
its O
tricoloured O
ribbons O
in O
the O
wind. O
Homais O
was O
talking. O
He O
explained O
to O
the O
company O
the O
future O
importance O
of O
this O
establishment, O
computed O
the O
strength O
of O
the O
floorings, O
the O
thickness O
of O
the O
walls, O
and O
regretted O
extremely O
not O
having O
a O
yard-stick O
such O
as O
Monsieur O
Binet O
possessed O
for O
his O
own O
special O
use. O
Emma, O
who O
had O
taken O
his O
arm, O
bent O
lightly O
against O
his O
shoulder, O
and O
she O
looked O
at O
the O
sun's O
disc O
shedding O
afar O
through O
the O
mist O
his O
pale O
splendour. O
She O
turned. O
Charles O
was O
there. O
His O
cap O
was O
drawn O
down O
over O
his O
eyebrows, O
and O
his O
two O
thick O
lips O
were O
trembling, O
which O
added O
a O
look O
of O
stupidity O
to O
his O
face; O
his O
very O
back, O
his O
calm O
back, O
was O
irritating O
to O
behold, O
and O
she O
saw O
written O
upon O
his O
coat O
all O
the O
platitude O
of O
the O
bearer. O
While O
she O
was O
considering O
him O
thus, O
tasting O
in O
her O
irritation O
a O
sort O
of O
depraved O
pleasure, O
Leon O
made O
a O
step O
forward. O
The O
cold O
that O
made O
him O
pale O
seemed O
to O
add O
a O
more O
gentle O
languor O
to O
his O
face; O
between O
his O
cravat O
and O
his O
neck O
the O
somewhat O
loose O
collar O
of O
his O
shirt O
showed O
the O
skin; O
the O
lobe O
of O
his O
ear O
looked O
out O
from O
beneath O
a O
lock O
of O
hair, O
and O
his O
large O
blue O
eyes, O
raised O
to O
the O
clouds, O
seemed O
to O
Emma O
more O
limpid O
and O
more O
beautiful O
than O
those O
mountain-lakes O
where O
the O
heavens O
are O
mirrored. O
"Wretched O
boy!" O
suddenly O
cried O
the O
chemist. O
And O
he O
ran O
to O
his O
son, O
who O
had O
just O
precipitated O
himself O
into O
a O
heap O
of O
lime O
in O
order O
to O
whiten O
his O
boots. O
At O
the O
reproaches O
with O
which O
he O
was O
being O
overwhelmed O
Napoleon O
began O
to O
roar, O
while O
Justin O
dried O
his O
shoes O
with O
a O
wisp O
of O
straw. O
But O
a O
knife O
was O
wanted; O
Charles O
offered O
his. O
"Ah!" O
she O
said O
to O
herself, O
"he O
carried O
a O
knife O
in O
his O
pocket O
like O
a O
peasant." O
The O
hoar-frost O
was O
falling, O
and O
they O
turned O
back O
to O
Yonville. O
In O
the O
evening O
Madame O
Bovary O
did O
not O
go O
to O
her O
neighbour's, O
and O
when O
Charles O
had O
left O
and O
she O
felt O
herself O
alone, O
the O
comparison O
re-began O
with O
the O
clearness O
of O
a O
sensation O
almost O
actual, O
and O
with O
that O
lengthening O
of O
perspective O
which O
memory O
gives O
to O
things. O
Looking O
from O
her O
bed O
at O
the O
clean O
fire O
that O
was O
burning, O
she O
still O
saw, O
as O
she O
had O
down O
there, O
Leon O
standing O
up O
with O
one O
hand O
behind O
his O
cane, O
and O
with O
the O
other O
holding O
Athalie, O
who O
was O
quietly O
sucking O
a O
piece O
of O
ice. O
She O
thought O
him O
charming; O
she O
could O
not O
tear O
herself O
away O
from O
him; O
she O
recalled O
his O
other O
attitudes O
on O
other O
days, O
the O
words O
he O
had O
spoken, O
the O
sound O
of O
his O
voice, O
his O
whole O
person; O
and O
she O
repeated, O
pouting O
out O
her O
lips O
as O
if O
for O
a O
kiss-- O
"Yes, O
charming! O
charming! O
Is O
he O
not O
in O
love?" O
she O
asked O
herself; O
"but O
with O
whom? O
With O
me?" O
All O
the O
proofs O
arose O
before O
her O
at O
once; O
her O
heart O
leapt. O
The O
flame O
of O
the O
fire O
threw O
a O
joyous O
light O
upon O
the O
ceiling; O
she O
turned O
on O
her O
back, O
stretching O
out O
her O
arms. O
Then O
began O
the O
eternal O
lamentation: O
"Oh, O
if O
Heaven O
had O
out O
willed O
it! O
And O
why O
not? O
What O
prevented O
it?" O
When O
Charles O
came O
home O
at O
midnight, O
she O
seemed O
to O
have O
just O
awakened, O
and O
as O
he O
made O
a O
noise O
undressing, O
she O
complained O
of O
a O
headache, O
then O
asked O
carelessly O
what O
had O
happened O
that O
evening. O
"Monsieur O
Leon," O
he O
said, O
"went O
to O
his O
room O
early." O
She O
could O
not O
help O
smiling, O
and O
she O
fell O
asleep, O
her O
soul O
filled O
with O
a O
new O
delight. O
The O
next O
day, O
at O
dusk, O
she O
received O
a O
visit O
from O
Monsieur O
Lherueux, O
the O
draper. O
He O
was O
a O
man O
of O
ability, O
was O
this O
shopkeeper. O
Born O
a O
Gascon O
but O
bred O
a O
Norman, O
he O
grafted O
upon O
his O
southern O
volubility O
the O
cunning O
of O
the O
Cauchois. O
His O
fat, O
flabby, O
beardless O
face O
seemed O
dyed O
by O
a O
decoction O
of O
liquorice, O
and O
his O
white O
hair O
made O
even O
more O
vivid O
the O
keen O
brilliance O
of O
his O
small O
black O
eyes. O
No O
one O
knew O
what O
he O
had O
been O
formerly; O
a O
pedlar O
said O
some, O
a O
banker O
at O
Routot O
according O
to O
others. O
What O
was O
certain O
was O
that O
he O
made O
complex O
calculations O
in O
his O
head O
that O
would O
have O
frightened O
Binet O
himself. O
Polite O
to O
obsequiousness, O
he O
always O
held O
himself O
with O
his O
back O
bent O
in O
the O
position O
of O
one O
who O
bows O
or O
who O
invites. O
After O
leaving O
at O
the O
door O
his O
hat O
surrounded O
with O
crape, O
he O
put O
down O
a O
green O
bandbox O
on O
the O
table, O
and O
began O
by O
complaining O
to O
madame, O
with O
many O
civilities, O
that O
he O
should O
have O
remained O
till O
that O
day O
without O
gaining O
her O
confidence. O
A O
poor O
shop O
like O
his O
was O
not O
made O
to O
attract O
a O
"fashionable O
lady"; O
he O
emphasized O
the O
words; O
yet O
she O
had O
only O
to O
command, O
and O
he O
would O
undertake O
to O
provide O
her O
with O
anything O
she O
might O
wish, O
either O
in O
haberdashery O
or O
linen, O
millinery O
or O
fancy O
goods, O
for O
he O
went O
to O
town O
regularly O
four O
times O
a O
month. O
He O
was O
connected O
with O
the O
best O
houses. O
You O
could O
speak O
of O
him O
at O
the O
"Trois O
Freres," O
at O
the O
"Barbe O
d'Or," O
or O
at O
the O
"Grand O
Sauvage"; O
all O
these O
gentlemen O
knew O
him O
as O
well O
as O
the O
insides O
of O
their O
pockets. O
To-day, O
then O
he O
had O
come O
to O
show O
madame, O
in O
passing, O
various O
articles O
he O
happened O
to O
have, O
thanks O
to O
the O
most O
rare O
opportunity. O
And O
he O
pulled O
out O
half-a-dozen O
embroidered O
collars O
from O
the O
box. O
Madame O
Bovary O
examined O
them. O
"I O
do O
not O
require O
anything," O
she O
said. O
Then O
Monsieur O
Lheureux O
delicately O
exhibited O
three O
Algerian O
scarves, O
several O
packets O
of O
English O
needles, O
a O
pair O
of O
straw O
slippers, O
and O
finally, O
four O
eggcups O
in O
cocoanut O
wood, O
carved O
in O
open O
work O
by O
convicts. O
Then, O
with O
both O
hands O
on O
the O
table, O
his O
neck O
stretched O
out, O
his O
figure O
bent O
forward, O
open-mouthed, O
he O
watched O
Emma's O
look, O
who O
was O
walking O
up O
and O
down O
undecided O
amid O
these O
goods. O
From O
time O
to O
time, O
as O
if O
to O
remove O
some O
dust, O
he O
filliped O
with O
his O
nail O
the O
silk O
of O
the O
scarves O
spread O
out O
at O
full O
length, O
and O
they O
rustled O
with O
a O
little O
noise, O
making O
in O
the O
green O
twilight O
the O
gold O
spangles O
of O
their O
tissue O
scintillate O
like O
little O
stars. O
"How O
much O
are O
they?" O
"A O
mere O
nothing," O
he O
replied, O
"a O
mere O
nothing. O
But O
there's O
no O
hurry; O
whenever O
it's O
convenient. O
We O
are O
not O
Jews." O
She O
reflected O
for O
a O
few O
moments, O
and O
ended O
by O
again O
declining O
Monsieur O
Lheureux's O
offer. O
He O
replied O
quite O
unconcernedly-- O
"Very O
well. O
We O
shall O
understand O
one O
another O
by O
and O
by. O
I O
have O
always O
got O
on O
with O
ladies-- O
if O
I O
didn't O
with O
my O
own!" O
Emma O
smiled. O
"I O
wanted O
to O
tell O
you," O
he O
went O
on O
good-naturedly, O
after O
his O
joke, O
"that O
it O
isn't O
the O
money O
I O
should O
trouble O
about. O
Why, O
I O
could O
give O
you O
some, O
if O
need O
be." O
She O
made O
a O
gesture O
of O
surprise. O
"Ah!" O
said O
he O
quickly O
and O
in O
a O
low O
voice, O
"I O
shouldn't O
have O
to O
go O
far O
to O
find O
you O
some, O
rely O
on O
that." O
And O
he O
began O
asking O
after O
Pere O
Tellier, O
the O
proprietor O
of O
the O
"Cafe O
Francais," O
whom O
Monsieur O
Bovary O
was O
then O
attending. O
"What's O
the O
matter O
with O
Pere O
Tellier? O
He O
coughs O
so O
that O
he O
shakes O
his O
whole O
house, O
and O
I'm O
afraid O
he'll O
soon O
want O
a O
deal O
covering O
rather O
than O
a O
flannel O
vest. O
He O
was O
such O
a O
rake O
as O
a O
young O
man! O
Those O
sort O
of O
people, O
madame, O
have O
not O
the O
least O
regularity; O
he's O
burnt O
up O
with O
brandy. O
Still O
it's O
sad, O
all O
the O
same, O
to O
see O
an O
acquaintance O
go O
off." O
And O
while O
he O
fastened O
up O
his O
box O
he O
discoursed O
about O
the O
doctor's O
patients. O
"It's O
the O
weather, O
no O
doubt," O
he O
said, O
looking O
frowningly O
at O
the O
floor, O
"that O
causes O
these O
illnesses. O
I, O
too, O
don't O
feel O
the O
thing. O
One O
of O
these O
days O
I O
shall O
even O
have O
to O
consult O
the O
doctor O
for O
a O
pain O
I O
have O
in O
my O
back. O
Well, O
good-bye, O
Madame O
Bovary. O
At O
your O
service; O
your O
very O
humble O
servant." O
And O
he O
closed O
the O
door O
gently. O
Emma O
had O
her O
dinner O
served O
in O
her O
bedroom O
on O
a O
tray O
by O
the O
fireside; O
she O
was O
a O
long O
time O
over O
it; O
everything O
was O
well O
with O
her. O
"How O
good O
I O
was!" O
she O
said O
to O
herself, O
thinking O
of O
the O
scarves. O
She O
heard O
some O
steps O
on O
the O
stairs. O
It O
was O
Leon. O
She O
got O
up O
and O
took O
from O
the O
chest O
of O
drawers O
the O
first O
pile O
of O
dusters O
to O
be O
hemmed. O
When O
he O
came O
in O
she O
seemed O
very O
busy. O
The O
conversation O
languished; O
Madame O
Bovary O
gave O
it O
up O
every O
few O
minutes, O
whilst O
he O
himself O
seemed O
quite O
embarrassed. O
Seated O
on O
a O
low O
chair O
near O
the O
fire, O
he O
turned O
round O
in O
his O
fingers O
the O
ivory O
thimble-case. O
She O
stitched O
on, O
or O
from O
time O
to O
time O
turned O
down O
the O
hem O
of O
the O
cloth O
with O
her O
nail. O
She O
did O
not O
speak; O
he O
was O
silent, O
captivated O
by O
her O
silence, O
as O
he O
would O
have O
been O
by O
her O
speech. O
"Poor O
fellow!" O
she O
thought. O
"How O
have O
I O
displeased O
her?" O
he O
asked O
himself. O
At O
last, O
however, O
Leon O
said O
that O
he O
should O
have, O
one O
of O
these O
days, O
to O
go O
to O
Rouen O
on O
some O
office O
business. O
"Your O
music O
subscription O
is O
out; O
am O
I O
to O
renew O
it?" O
"No," O
she O
replied. O
"Why?" O
"Because O
-- O
" O
And O
pursing O
her O
lips O
she O
slowly O
drew O
a O
long O
stitch O
of O
grey O
thread. O
This O
work O
irritated O
Leon. O
It O
seemed O
to O
roughen O
the O
ends O
of O
her O
fingers. O
A O
gallant O
phrase O
came O
into O
his O
head, O
but O
he O
did O
not O
risk O
it. O
"Then O
you O
are O
giving O
it O
up?" O
he O
went O
on. O
"What?" O
she O
asked O
hurriedly. O
"Music? O
Ah! O
yes! O
Have O
I O
not O
my O
house O
to O
look O
after, O
my O
husband O
to O
attend O
to, O
a O
thousand O
things, O
in O
fact, O
many O
duties O
that O
must O
be O
considered O
first?" O
She O
looked O
at O
the O
clock. O
Charles O
was O
late. O
Then, O
she O
affected O
anxiety. O
Two O
or O
three O
times O
she O
even O
repeated, O
"He O
is O
so O
good!" O
The O
clerk O
was O
fond O
of O
Monsieur O
Bovary. O
But O
this O
tenderness O
on O
his O
behalf O
astonished O
him O
unpleasantly; O
nevertheless O
he O
took O
up O
on O
his O
praises, O
which O
he O
said O
everyone O
was O
singing, O
especially O
the O
chemist. O
"Ah! O
he O
is O
a O
good O
fellow," O
continued O
Emma. O
"Certainly," O
replied O
the O
clerk. O
And O
he O
began O
talking O
of O
Madame O
Homais, O
whose O
very O
untidy O
appearance O
generally O
made O
them O
laugh. O
"What O
does O
it O
matter?" O
interrupted O
Emma. O
"A O
good O
housewife O
does O
not O
trouble O
about O
her O
appearance." O
Then O
she O
relapsed O
into O
silence. O
It O
was O
the O
same O
on O
the O
following O
days; O
her O
talks, O
her O
manners, O
everything O
changed. O
She O
took O
interest O
in O
the O
housework, O
went O
to O
church O
regularly, O
and O
looked O
after O
her O
servant O
with O
more O
severity. O
She O
took O
Berthe O
from O
nurse. O
When O
visitors O
called, O
Felicite O
brought O
her O
in, O
and O
Madame O
Bovary O
undressed O
her O
to O
show O
off O
her O
limbs. O
She O
declared O
she O
adored O
children; O
this O
was O
her O
consolation, O
her O
joy, O
her O
passion, O
and O
she O
accompanied O
her O
caresses O
with O
lyrical O
outburst O
which O
would O
have O
reminded O
anyone O
but O
the O
Yonville O
people O
of O
Sachette O
in O
"Notre O
Dame O
de O
Paris." O
When O
Charles O
came O
home O
he O
found O
his O
slippers O
put O
to O
warm O
near O
the O
fire. O
His O
waistcoat O
now O
never O
wanted O
lining, O
nor O
his O
shirt O
buttons, O
and O
it O
was O
quite O
a O
pleasure O
to O
see O
in O
the O
cupboard O
the O
night-caps O
arranged O
in O
piles O
of O
the O
same O
height. O
She O
no O
longer O
grumbled O
as O
formerly O
at O
taking O
a O
turn O
in O
the O
garden; O
what O
he O
proposed O
was O
always O
done, O
although O
she O
did O
not O
understand O
the O
wishes O
to O
which O
she O
submitted O
without O
a O
murmur; O
and O
when O
Leon O
saw O
him O
by O
his O
fireside O
after O
dinner, O
his O
two O
hands O
on O
his O
stomach, O
his O
two O
feet O
on O
the O
fender, O
his O
two O
cheeks O
red O
with O
feeding, O
his O
eyes O
moist O
with O
happiness, O
the O
child O
crawling O
along O
the O
carpet, O
and O
this O
woman O
with O
the O
slender O
waist O
who O
came O
behind O
his O
arm-chair O
to O
kiss O
his O
forehead: O
"What O
madness!" O
he O
said O
to O
himself. O
"And O
how O
to O
reach O
her!" O
And O
thus O
she O
seemed O
so O
virtuous O
and O
inaccessible O
to O
him O
that O
he O
lost O
all O
hope, O
even O
the O
faintest. O
But O
by O
this O
renunciation O
he O
placed O
her O
on O
an O
extraordinary O
pinnacle. O
To O
him O
she O
stood O
outside O
those O
fleshly O
attributes O
from O
which O
he O
had O
nothing O
to O
obtain, O
and O
in O
his O
heart O
she O
rose O
ever, O
and O
became O
farther O
removed O
from O
him O
after O
the O
magnificent O
manner O
of O
an O
apotheosis O
that O
is O
taking O
wing. O
It O
was O
one O
of O
those O
pure O
feelings O
that O
do O
not O
interfere O
with O
life, O
that O
are O
cultivated O
because O
they O
are O
rare, O
and O
whose O
loss O
would O
afflict O
more O
than O
their O
passion O
rejoices. O
Emma O
grew O
thinner, O
her O
cheeks O
paler, O
her O
face O
longer. O
With O
her O
black O
hair, O
her O
large O
eyes, O
her O
aquiline O
nose, O
her O
birdlike O
walk, O
and O
always O
silent O
now, O
did O
she O
not O
seem O
to O
be O
passing O
through O
life O
scarcely O
touching O
it, O
and O
to O
bear O
on O
her O
brow O
the O
vague O
impress O
of O
some O
divine O
destiny? O
She O
was O
so O
sad O
and O
so O
calm, O
at O
once O
so O
gentle O
and O
so O
reserved, O
that O
near O
her O
one O
felt O
oneself O
seized O
by O
an O
icy O
charm, O
as O
we O
shudder O
in O
churches O
at O
the O
perfume O
of O
the O
flowers O
mingling O
with O
the O
cold O
of O
the O
marble. O
The O
others O
even O
did O
not O
escape O
from O
this O
seduction. O
The O
chemist O
said-- O
"She O
is O
a O
woman O
of O
great O
parts, O
who O
wouldn't O
be O
misplaced O
in O
a O
sub-prefecture." O
The O
housewives O
admired O
her O
economy, O
the O
patients O
her O
politeness, O
the O
poor O
her O
charity. O
But O
she O
was O
eaten O
up O
with O
desires, O
with O
rage, O
with O
hate. O
That O
dress O
with O
the O
narrow O
folds O
hid O
a O
distracted O
fear, O
of O
whose O
torment O
those O
chaste O
lips O
said O
nothing. O
She O
was O
in O
love O
with O
Leon, O
and O
sought O
solitude O
that O
she O
might O
with O
the O
more O
ease O
delight O
in O
his O
image. O
The O
sight O
of O
his O
form O
troubled O
the O
voluptuousness O
of O
this O
mediation. O
Emma O
thrilled O
at O
the O
sound O
of O
his O
step; O
then O
in O
his O
presence O
the O
emotion O
subsided, O
and O
afterwards O
there O
remained O
to O
her O
only O
an O
immense O
astonishment O
that O
ended O
in O
sorrow. O
Leon O
did O
not O
know O
that O
when O
he O
left O
her O
in O
despair O
she O
rose O
after O
he O
had O
gone O
to O
see O
him O
in O
the O
street. O
She O
concerned O
herself O
about O
his O
comings O
and O
goings; O
she O
watched O
his O
face; O
she O
invented O
quite O
a O
history O
to O
find O
an O
excuse O
for O
going O
to O
his O
room. O
The O
chemist's O
wife O
seemed O
happy O
to O
her O
to O
sleep O
under O
the O
same O
roof, O
and O
her O
thoughts O
constantly O
centered O
upon O
this O
house, O
like O
the O
"Lion O
d'Or" O
pigeons, O
who O
came O
there O
to O
dip O
their O
red O
feet O
and O
white O
wings O
in O
its O
gutters. O
But O
the O
more O
Emma O
recognised O
her O
love, O
the O
more O
she O
crushed O
it O
down, O
that O
it O
might O
not O
be O
evident, O
that O
she O
might O
make O
it O
less. O
She O
would O
have O
liked O
Leon O
to O
guess O
it, O
and O
she O
imagined O
chances, O
catastrophes O
that O
should O
facilitate O
this. O
What O
restrained O
her O
was, O
no O
doubt, O
idleness O
and O
fear, O
and O
a O
sense O
of O
shame O
also. O
She O
thought O
she O
had O
repulsed O
him O
too O
much, O
that O
the O
time O
was O
past, O
that O
all O
was O
lost. O
Then, O
pride, O
and O
joy O
of O
being O
able O
to O
say O
to O
herself, O
"I O
am O
virtuous," O
and O
to O
look O
at O
herself O
in O
the O
glass O
taking O
resigned O
poses, O
consoled O
her O
a O
little O
for O
the O
sacrifice O
she O
believed O
she O
was O
making. O
Then O
the O
lusts O
of O
the O
flesh, O
the O
longing O
for O
money, O
and O
the O
melancholy O
of O
passion O
all O
blended O
themselves O
into O
one O
suffering, O
and O
instead O
of O
turning O
her O
thoughts O
from O
it, O
she O
clave O
to O
it O
the O
more, O
urging O
herself O
to O
pain, O
and O
seeking O
everywhere O
occasion O
for O
it. O
She O
was O
irritated O
by O
an O
ill-served O
dish O
or O
by O
a O
half-open O
door; O
bewailed O
the O
velvets O
she O
had O
not, O
the O
happiness O
she O
had O
missed, O
her O
too O
exalted O
dreams, O
her O
narrow O
home. O
What O
exasperated O
her O
was O
that O
Charles O
did O
not O
seem O
to O
notice O
her O
anguish. O
His O
conviction O
that O
he O
was O
making O
her O
happy O
seemed O
to O
her O
an O
imbecile O
insult, O
and O
his O
sureness O
on O
this O
point O
ingratitude. O
For O
whose O
sake, O
then O
was O
she O
virtuous? O
Was O
it O
not O
for O
him, O
the O
obstacle O
to O
all O
felicity, O
the O
cause O
of O
all O
misery, O
and, O
as O
it O
were, O
the O
sharp O
clasp O
of O
that O
complex O
strap O
that O
bucked O
her O
in O
on O
all O
sides. O
On O
him O
alone, O
then, O
she O
concentrated O
all O
the O
various O
hatreds O
that O
resulted O
from O
her O
boredom, O
and O
every O
effort O
to O
diminish O
only O
augmented O
it; O
for O
this O
useless O
trouble O
was O
added O
to O
the O
other O
reasons O
for O
despair, O
and O
contributed O
still O
more O
to O
the O
separation O
between O
them. O
Her O
own O
gentleness O
to O
herself O
made O
her O
rebel O
against O
him. O
Domestic O
mediocrity O
drove O
her O
to O
lewd O
fancies, O
marriage O
tenderness O
to O
adulterous O
desires. O
She O
would O
have O
liked O
Charles O
to O
beat O
her, O
that O
she O
might O
have O
a O
better O
right O
to O
hate O
him, O
to O
revenge O
herself O
upon O
him. O
She O
was O
surprised O
sometimes O
at O
the O
atrocious O
conjectures O
that O
came O
into O
her O
thoughts, O
and O
she O
had O
to O
go O
on O
smiling, O
to O
hear O
repeated O
to O
her O
at O
all O
hours O
that O
she O
was O
happy, O
to O
pretend O
to O
be O
happy, O
to O
let O
it O
be O
believed. O
Yet O
she O
had O
loathing O
of O
this O
hypocrisy. O
She O
was O
seized O
with O
the O
temptation O
to O
flee O
somewhere O
with O
Leon O
to O
try O
a O
new O
life; O
but O
at O
once O
a O
vague O
chasm O
full O
of O
darkness O
opened O
within O
her O
soul. O
"Besides, O
he O
no O
longer O
loves O
me," O
she O
thought. O
"What O
is O
to O
become O
of O
me? O
What O
help O
is O
to O
be O
hoped O
for, O
what O
consolation, O
what O
solace?" O
She O
was O
left O
broken, O
breathless, O
inert, O
sobbing O
in O
a O
low O
voice, O
with O
flowing O
tears. O
"Why O
don't O
you O
tell O
master?" O
the O
servant O
asked O
her O
when O
she O
came O
in O
during O
these O
crises. O
"It O
is O
the O
nerves," O
said O
Emma. O
"Do O
not O
speak O
to O
him O
of O
it; O
it O
would O
worry O
him." O
"Ah! O
yes," O
Felicite O
went O
on, O
"you O
are O
just O
like O
La O
Guerine, O
Pere O
Guerin's O
daughter, O
the O
fisherman O
at O
Pollet, O
that O
I O
used O
to O
know O
at O
Dieppe O
before O
I O
came O
to O
you. O
She O
was O
so O
sad, O
so O
sad, O
to O
see O
her O
standing O
upright O
on O
the O
threshold O
of O
her O
house, O
she O
seemed O
to O
you O
like O
a O
winding-sheet O
spread O
out O
before O
the O
door. O
Her O
illness, O
it O
appears, O
was O
a O
kind O
of O
fog O
that O
she O
had O
in O
her O
head, O
and O
the O
doctors O
could O
not O
do O
anything, O
nor O
the O
priest O
either. O
When O
she O
was O
taken O
too O
bad O
she O
went O
off O
quite O
alone O
to O
the O
sea-shore, O
so O
that O
the O
customs O
officer, O
going O
his O
rounds, O
often O
found O
her O
lying O
flat O
on O
her O
face, O
crying O
on O
the O
shingle. O
Then, O
after O
her O
marriage, O
it O
went O
off, O
they O
say." O
"But O
with O
me," O
replied O
Emma, O
"it O
was O
after O
marriage O
that O
it O
began." O
CHAPTER O
SIX O
One O
evening O
when O
the O
window O
was O
open, O
and O
she, O
sitting O
by O
it, O
had O
been O
watching O
Lestiboudois, O
the O
beadle, O
trimming O
the O
box, O
she O
suddenly O
heard O
the O
Angelus O
ringing. O
It O
was O
the O
beginning O
of O
April, O
when O
the O
primroses O
are O
in O
bloom, O
and O
a O
warm O
wind O
blows O
over O
the O
flower-beds O
newly O
turned, O
and O
the O
gardens, O
like O
women, O
seem O
to O
be O
getting O
ready O
for O
the O
summer O
fetes. O
Through O
the O
bars O
of O
the O
arbour O
and O
away O
beyond, O
the O
river O
seen O
in O
the O
fields, O
meandering O
through O
the O
grass O
in O
wandering O
curves. O
The O
evening O
vapours O
rose O
between O
the O
leafless O
poplars, O
touching O
their O
outlines O
with O
a O
violet O
tint, O
paler O
and O
more O
transparent O
than O
a O
subtle O
gauze O
caught O
athwart O
their O
branches. O
In O
the O
distance O
cattle O
moved O
about; O
neither O
their O
steps O
nor O
their O
lowing O
could O
be O
heard; O
and O
the O
bell, O
still O
ringing O
through O
the O
air, O
kept O
up O
its O
peaceful O
lamentation. O
With O
this O
repeated O
tinkling O
the O
thoughts O
of O
the O
young O
woman O
lost O
themselves O
in O
old O
memories O
of O
her O
youth O
and O
school-days. O
She O
remembered O
the O
great O
candlesticks O
that O
rose O
above O
the O
vases O
full O
of O
flowers O
on O
the O
altar, O
and O
the O
tabernacle O
with O
its O
small O
columns. O
She O
would O
have O
liked O
to O
be O
once O
more O
lost O
in O
the O
long O
line O
of O
white O
veils, O
marked O
off O
here O
and O
there O
by O
the O
stuff O
black O
hoods O
of O
the O
good O
sisters O
bending O
over O
their O
prie-Dieu. O
At O
mass O
on O
Sundays, O
when O
she O
looked O
up, O
she O
saw O
the O
gentle O
face O
of O
the O
Virgin O
amid O
the O
blue O
smoke O
of O
the O
rising O
incense. O
Then O
she O
was O
moved; O
she O
felt O
herself O
weak O
and O
quite O
deserted, O
like O
the O
down O
of O
a O
bird O
whirled O
by O
the O
tempest, O
and O
it O
was O
unconsciously O
that O
she O
went O
towards O
the O
church, O
included O
to O
no O
matter O
what O
devotions, O
so O
that O
her O
soul O
was O
absorbed O
and O
all O
existence O
lost O
in O
it. O
On O
the O
Place O
she O
met O
Lestivoudois O
on O
his O
way O
back, O
for, O
in O
order O
not O
to O
shorten O
his O
day's O
labour, O
he O
preferred O
interrupting O
his O
work, O
then O
beginning O
it O
again, O
so O
that O
he O
rang O
the O
Angelus O
to O
suit O
his O
own O
convenience. O
Besides, O
the O
ringing O
over O
a O
little O
earlier O
warned O
the O
lads O
of O
catechism O
hour. O
Already O
a O
few O
who O
had O
arrived O
were O
playing O
marbles O
on O
the O
stones O
of O
the O
cemetery. O
Others, O
astride O
the O
wall, O
swung O
their O
legs, O
kicking O
with O
their O
clogs O
the O
large O
nettles O
growing O
between O
the O
little O
enclosure O
and O
the O
newest O
graves. O
This O
was O
the O
only O
green O
spot. O
All O
the O
rest O
was O
but O
stones, O
always O
covered O
with O
a O
fine O
powder, O
despite O
the O
vestry-broom. O
The O
children O
in O
list O
shoes O
ran O
about O
there O
as O
if O
it O
were O
an O
enclosure O
made O
for O
them. O
The O
shouts O
of O
their O
voices O
could O
be O
heard O
through O
the O
humming O
of O
the O
bell. O
This O
grew O
less O
and O
less O
with O
the O
swinging O
of O
the O
great O
rope O
that, O
hanging O
from O
the O
top O
of O
the O
belfry, O
dragged O
its O
end O
on O
the O
ground. O
Swallows O
flitted O
to O
and O
fro O
uttering O
little O
cries, O
cut O
the O
air O
with O
the O
edge O
of O
their O
wings, O
and O
swiftly O
returned O
to O
their O
yellow O
nests O
under O
the O
tiles O
of O
the O
coping. O
At O
the O
end O
of O
the O
church O
a O
lamp O
was O
burning, O
the O
wick O
of O
a O
night-light O
in O
a O
glass O
hung O
up. O
Its O
light O
from O
a O
distance O
looked O
like O
a O
white O
stain O
trembling O
in O
the O
oil. O
A O
long O
ray O
of O
the O
sun O
fell O
across O
the O
nave O
and O
seemed O
to O
darken O
the O
lower O
sides O
and O
the O
corners. O
"Where O
is O
the O
cure?" O
asked O
Madame O
Bovary O
of O
one O
of O
the O
lads, O
who O
was O
amusing O
himself O
by O
shaking O
a O
swivel O
in O
a O
hole O
too O
large O
for O
it. O
"He O
is O
just O
coming," O
he O
answered. O
And O
in O
fact O
the O
door O
of O
the O
presbytery O
grated; O
Abbe O
Bournisien O
appeared; O
the O
children, O
pell-mell, O
fled O
into O
the O
church. O
"These O
young O
scamps!" O
murmured O
the O
priest, O
"always O
the O
same!" O
Then, O
picking O
up O
a O
catechism O
all O
in O
rags O
that O
he O
had O
struck O
with O
is O
foot, O
"They O
respect O
nothing!" O
But O
as O
soon O
as O
he O
caught O
sight O
of O
Madame O
Bovary, O
"Excuse O
me," O
he O
said; O
"I O
did O
not O
recognise O
you." O
He O
thrust O
the O
catechism O
into O
his O
pocket, O
and O
stopped O
short, O
balancing O
the O
heavy O
vestry O
key O
between O
his O
two O
fingers. O
The O
light O
of O
the O
setting O
sun O
that O
fell O
full O
upon O
his O
face O
paled O
the O
lasting O
of O
his O
cassock, O
shiny O
at O
the O
elbows, O
unravelled O
at O
the O
hem. O
Grease O
and O
tobacco O
stains O
followed O
along O
his O
broad O
chest O
the O
lines O
of O
the O
buttons, O
and O
grew O
more O
numerous O
the O
farther O
they O
were O
from O
his O
neckcloth, O
in O
which O
the O
massive O
folds O
of O
his O
red O
chin O
rested; O
this O
was O
dotted O
with O
yellow O
spots, O
that O
disappeared O
beneath O
the O
coarse O
hair O
of O
his O
greyish O
beard. O
He O
had O
just O
dined O
and O
was O
breathing O
noisily. O
"How O
are O
you?" O
he O
added. O
"Not O
well," O
replied O
Emma; O
"I O
am O
ill." O
"Well, O
and O
so O
am O
I," O
answered O
the O
priest. O
"These O
first O
warm O
days O
weaken O
one O
most O
remarkably, O
don't O
they? O
But, O
after O
all, O
we O
are O
born O
to O
suffer, O
as O
St. O
Paul O
says. O
But O
what O
does O
Monsieur O
Bovary O
think O
of O
it?" O
"He!" O
she O
said O
with O
a O
gesture O
of O
contempt. O
"What!" O
replied O
the O
good O
fellow, O
quite O
astonished, O
"doesn't O
he O
prescribe O
something O
for O
you?" O
"Ah!" O
said O
Emma, O
"it O
is O
no O
earthly O
remedy O
I O
need." O
But O
the O
cure O
from O
time O
to O
time O
looked O
into O
the O
church, O
where O
the O
kneeling O
boys O
were O
shouldering O
one O
another, O
and O
tumbling O
over O
like O
packs O
of O
cards. O
"I O
should O
like O
to O
know O
-- O
" O
she O
went O
on. O
"You O
look O
out, O
Riboudet," O
cried O
the O
priest O
in O
an O
angry O
voice; O
"I'll O
warm O
your O
ears, O
you O
imp!" O
Then O
turning O
to O
Emma, O
"He's O
Boudet O
the O
carpenter's O
son; O
his O
parents O
are O
well O
off, O
and O
let O
him O
do O
just O
as O
he O
pleases. O
Yet O
he O
could O
learn O
quickly O
if O
he O
would, O
for O
he O
is O
very O
sharp. O
And O
so O
sometimes O
for O
a O
joke O
I O
call O
him O
Riboudet O
(like O
the O
road O
one O
takes O
to O
go O
to O
Maromme) O
and O
I O
even O
say O
'Mon O
Riboudet.' O
Ha! O
Ha! O
'Mont O
Riboudet.' O
The O
other O
day O
I O
repeated O
that O
just O
to O
Monsignor, O
and O
he O
laughed O
at O
it; O
he O
condescended O
to O
laugh O
at O
it. O
And O
how O
is O
Monsieur O
Bovary?" O
She O
seemed O
not O
to O
hear O
him. O
And O
he O
went O
on-- O
"Always O
very O
busy, O
no O
doubt; O
for O
he O
and O
I O
are O
certainly O
the O
busiest O
people O
in O
the O
parish. O
But O
he O
is O
doctor O
of O
the O
body," O
he O
added O
with O
a O
thick O
laugh, O
"and O
I O
of O
the O
soul." O
She O
fixed O
her O
pleading O
eyes O
upon O
the O
priest. O
"Yes," O
she O
said, O
"you O
solace O
all O
sorrows." O
"Ah! O
don't O
talk O
to O
me O
of O
it, O
Madame O
Bovary. O
This O
morning O
I O
had O
to O
go O
to O
Bas-Diauville O
for O
a O
cow O
that O
was O
ill; O
they O
thought O
it O
was O
under O
a O
spell. O
All O
their O
cows, O
I O
don't O
know O
how O
it O
is-- O
But O
pardon O
me! O
Longuemarre O
and O
Boudet! O
Bless O
me! O
Will O
you O
leave O
off?" O
And O
with O
a O
bound O
he O
ran O
into O
the O
church. O
The O
boys O
were O
just O
then O
clustering O
round O
the O
large O
desk, O
climbing O
over O
the O
precentor's O
footstool, O
opening O
the O
missal; O
and O
others O
on O
tiptoe O
were O
just O
about O
to O
venture O
into O
the O
confessional. O
But O
the O
priest O
suddenly O
distributed O
a O
shower O
of O
cuffs O
among O
them. O
Seizing O
them O
by O
the O
collars O
of O
their O
coats, O
he O
lifted O
them O
from O
the O
ground, O
and O
deposited O
them O
on O
their O
knees O
on O
the O
stones O
of O
the O
choir, O
firmly, O
as O
if O
he O
meant O
planting O
them O
there. O
"Yes," O
said O
he, O
when O
he O
returned O
to O
Emma, O
unfolding O
his O
large O
cotton O
handkerchief, O
one O
corner O
of O
which O
he O
put O
between O
his O
teeth, O
"farmers O
are O
much O
to O
be O
pitied." O
"Others, O
too," O
she O
replied. O
"Assuredly. O
Town-labourers, O
for O
example." O
"It O
is O
not O
they O
-- O
" O
"Pardon! O
I've O
there O
known O
poor O
mothers O
of O
families, O
virtuous O
women, O
I O
assure O
you, O
real O
saints, O
who O
wanted O
even O
bread." O
"But O
those," O
replied O
Emma, O
and O
the O
corners O
of O
her O
mouth O
twitched O
as O
she O
spoke, O
"those, O
Monsieur O
le O
Cure, O
who O
have O
bread O
and O
have O
no O
-- O
" O
"Fire O
in O
the O
winter," O
said O
the O
priest. O
"Oh, O
what O
does O
that O
matter?" O
"What! O
What O
does O
it O
matter? O
It O
seems O
to O
me O
that O
when O
one O
has O
firing O
and O
food-- O
for, O
after O
all O
-- O
" O
"My O
God! O
my O
God!" O
she O
sighed. O
"It O
is O
indigestion, O
no O
doubt? O
You O
must O
get O
home, O
Madame O
Bovary; O
drink O
a O
little O
tea, O
that O
will O
strengthen O
you, O
or O
else O
a O
glass O
of O
fresh O
water O
with O
a O
little O
moist O
sugar." O
"Why?" O
And O
she O
looked O
like O
one O
awaking O
from O
a O
dream. O
"Well, O
you O
see, O
you O
were O
putting O
your O
hand O
to O
your O
forehead. O
I O
thought O
you O
felt O
faint." O
Then, O
bethinking O
himself, O
"But O
you O
were O
asking O
me O
something? O
What O
was O
it? O
I O
really O
don't O
remember." O
"I? O
Nothing! O
nothing!" O
repeated O
Emma. O
And O
the O
glance O
she O
cast O
round O
her O
slowly O
fell O
upon O
the O
old O
man O
in O
the O
cassock. O
They O
looked O
at O
one O
another O
face O
to O
face O
without O
speaking. O
"Then, O
Madame O
Bovary," O
he O
said O
at O
last, O
"excuse O
me, O
but O
duty O
first, O
you O
know; O
I O
must O
look O
after O
my O
good-for-nothings. O
The O
first O
communion O
will O
soon O
be O
upon O
us, O
and O
I O
fear O
we O
shall O
be O
behind O
after O
all. O
So O
after O
Ascension O
Day O
I O
keep O
them O
recta O
an O
extra O
hour O
every O
Wednesday. O
Poor O
children! O
One O
cannot O
lead O
them O
too O
soon O
into O
the O
path O
of O
the O
Lord, O
as, O
moreover, O
he O
has O
himself O
recommended O
us O
to O
do O
by O
the O
mouth O
of O
his O
Divine O
Son. O
Good O
health O
to O
you, O
madame; O
my O
respects O
to O
your O
husband." O
ON O
THE O
STRAIGHT O
AND O
NARROW O
PATH. O
And O
he O
went O
into O
the O
church O
making O
a O
genuflexion O
as O
soon O
as O
he O
reached O
the O
door. O
Emma O
saw O
him O
disappear O
between O
the O
double O
row O
of O
forms, O
walking O
with O
a O
heavy O
tread, O
his O
head O
a O
little O
bent O
over O
his O
shoulder, O
and O
with O
his O
two O
hands O
half-open O
behind O
him. O
Then O
she O
turned O
on O
her O
heel O
all O
of O
one O
piece, O
like O
a O
statue O
on O
a O
pivot, O
and O
went O
homewards. O
But O
the O
loud O
voice O
of O
the O
priest, O
the O
clear O
voices O
of O
the O
boys O
still O
reached O
her O
ears, O
and O
went O
on O
behind O
her. O
"Are O
you O
a O
Christian?" O
"Yes, O
I O
am O
a O
Christian." O
"What O
is O
a O
Christian?" O
"He O
who, O
being O
baptized-baptized-baptized O
-- O
" O
She O
went O
up O
the O
steps O
of O
the O
staircase O
holding O
on O
to O
the O
banisters, O
and O
when O
she O
was O
in O
her O
room O
threw O
herself O
into O
an O
arm-chair. O
The O
whitish O
light O
of O
the O
window-panes O
fell O
with O
soft O
undulations. O
The O
furniture O
in O
its O
place O
seemed O
to O
have O
become O
more O
immobile, O
and O
to O
lose O
itself O
in O
the O
shadow O
as O
in O
an O
ocean O
of O
darkness. O
The O
fire O
was O
out, O
the O
clock O
went O
on O
ticking, O
and O
Emma O
vaguely O
marvelled O
at O
this O
calm O
of O
all O
things O
while O
within O
herself O
was O
such O
tumult. O
But O
little O
Berthe O
was O
there, O
between O
the O
window O
and O
the O
work-table, O
tottering O
on O
her O
knitted O
shoes, O
and O
trying O
to O
come O
to O
her O
mother O
to O
catch O
hold O
of O
the O
ends O
of O
her O
apron-strings. O
"Leave O
me O
alone," O
said O
the O
latter, O
putting O
her O
from O
her O
with O
her O
hand. O
The O
little O
girl O
soon O
came O
up O
closer O
against O
her O
knees, O
and O
leaning O
on O
them O
with O
her O
arms, O
she O
looked O
up O
with O
her O
large O
blue O
eyes, O
while O
a O
small O
thread O
of O
pure O
saliva O
dribbled O
from O
her O
lips O
on O
to O
the O
silk O
apron. O
"Leave O
me O
alone," O
repeated O
the O
young O
woman O
quite O
irritably. O
Her O
face O
frightened O
the O
child, O
who O
began O
to O
scream. O
"Will O
you O
leave O
me O
alone?" O
she O
said, O
pushing O
her O
with O
her O
elbow. O
Berthe O
fell O
at O
the O
foot O
of O
the O
drawers O
against O
the O
brass O
handle, O
cutting O
her O
cheek, O
which O
began O
to O
bleed, O
against O
it. O
Madame O
Bovary O
sprang O
to O
lift O
her O
up, O
broke O
the O
bell-rope, O
called O
for O
the O
servant O
with O
all O
her O
might, O
and O
she O
was O
just O
going O
to O
curse O
herself O
when O
Charles O
appeared. O
It O
was O
the O
dinner-hour; O
he O
had O
come O
home. O
"Look, O
dear!" O
said O
Emma, O
in O
a O
calm O
voice, O
"the O
little O
one O
fell O
down O
while O
she O
was O
playing, O
and O
has O
hurt O
herself." O
Charles O
reassured O
her; O
the O
case O
was O
not O
a O
serious O
one, O
and O
he O
went O
for O
some O
sticking O
plaster. O
Madame O
Bovary O
did O
not O
go O
downstairs O
to O
the O
dining-room; O
she O
wished O
to O
remain O
alone O
to O
look O
after O
the O
child. O
Then O
watching O
her O
sleep, O
the O
little O
anxiety O
she O
felt O
gradually O
wore O
off, O
and O
she O
seemed O
very O
stupid O
to O
herself, O
and O
very O
good O
to O
have O
been O
so O
worried O
just O
now O
at O
so O
little. O
Berthe, O
in O
fact, O
no O
longer O
sobbed. O
Her O
breathing O
now O
imperceptibly O
raised O
the O
cotton O
covering. O
Big O
tears O
lay O
in O
the O
corner O
of O
the O
half-closed O
eyelids, O
through O
whose O
lashes O
one O
could O
see O
two O
pale O
sunken O
pupils; O
the O
plaster O
stuck O
on O
her O
cheek O
drew O
the O
skin O
obliquely. O
"It O
is O
very O
strange," O
thought O
Emma, O
"how O
ugly O
this O
child O
is!" O
When O
at O
eleven O
o'clock O
Charles O
came O
back O
from O
the O
chemist's O
shop, O
whither O
he O
had O
gone O
after O
dinner O
to O
return O
the O
remainder O
of O
the O
sticking-plaster, O
he O
found O
his O
wife O
standing O
by O
the O
cradle. O
"I O
assure O
you O
it's O
nothing." O
he O
said, O
kissing O
her O
on O
the O
forehead. O
"Don't O
worry, O
my O
poor O
darling; O
you O
will O
make O
yourself O
ill." O
He O
had O
stayed O
a O
long O
time O
at O
the O
chemist's. O
Although O
he O
had O
not O
seemed O
much O
moved, O
Homais, O
nevertheless, O
had O
exerted O
himself O
to O
buoy O
him O
up, O
to O
"keep O
up O
his O
spirits." O
Then O
they O
had O
talked O
of O
the O
various O
dangers O
that O
threaten O
childhood, O
of O
the O
carelessness O
of O
servants. O
Madame O
Homais O
knew O
something O
of O
it, O
having O
still O
upon O
her O
chest O
the O
marks O
left O
by O
a O
basin O
full O
of O
soup O
that O
a O
cook O
had O
formerly O
dropped O
on O
her O
pinafore, O
and O
her O
good O
parents O
took O
no O
end O
of O
trouble O
for O
her. O
The O
knives O
were O
not O
sharpened, O
nor O
the O
floors O
waxed; O
there O
were O
iron O
gratings O
to O
the O
windows O
and O
strong O
bars O
across O
the O
fireplace; O
the O
little O
Homais, O
in O
spite O
of O
their O
spirit, O
could O
not O
stir O
without O
someone O
watching O
them; O
at O
the O
slightest O
cold O
their O
father O
stuffed O
them O
with O
pectorals; O
and O
until O
they O
were O
turned O
four O
they O
all, O
without O
pity, O
had O
to O
wear O
wadded O
head-protectors. O
This, O
it O
is O
true, O
was O
a O
fancy O
of O
Madame O
Homais'; O
her O
husband O
was O
inwardly O
afflicted O
at O
it. O
Fearing O
the O
possible O
consequences O
of O
such O
compression O
to O
the O
intellectual O
organs. O
He O
even O
went O
so O
far O
as O
to O
say O
to O
her, O
"Do O
you O
want O
to O
make O
Caribs O
or O
Botocudos O
of O
them?" O
Charles, O
however, O
had O
several O
times O
tried O
to O
interrupt O
the O
conversation. O
"I O
should O
like O
to O
speak O
to O
you," O
he O
had O
whispered O
in O
the O
clerk's O
ear, O
who O
went O
upstairs O
in O
front O
of O
him. O
"Can O
he O
suspect O
anything?" O
Leon O
asked O
himself. O
His O
heart O
beat, O
and O
he O
racked O
his O
brain O
with O
surmises. O
At O
last, O
Charles, O
having O
shut O
the O
door, O
asked O
him O
to O
see O
himself O
what O
would O
be O
the O
price O
at O
Rouen O
of O
a O
fine O
daguerreotypes. O
It O
was O
a O
sentimental O
surprise O
he O
intended O
for O
his O
wife, O
a O
delicate O
attention-- O
his O
portrait O
in O
a O
frock-coat. O
But O
he O
wanted O
first O
to O
know O
"how O
much O
it O
would O
be." O
The O
inquiries O
would O
not O
put O
Monsieur O
Leon O
out, O
since O
he O
went O
to O
town O
almost O
every O
week. O
Why? O
Monsieur O
Homais O
suspected O
some O
"young O
man's O
affair" O
at O
the O
bottom O
of O
it, O
an O
intrigue. O
But O
he O
was O
mistaken. O
Leon O
was O
after O
no O
love-making. O
He O
was O
sadder O
than O
ever, O
as O
Madame O
Lefrancois O
saw O
from O
the O
amount O
of O
food O
he O
left O
on O
his O
plate. O
To O
find O
out O
more O
about O
it O
she O
questioned O
the O
tax-collector. O
Binet O
answered O
roughly O
that O
he O
"wasn't O
paid O
by O
the O
police." O
All O
the O
same, O
his O
companion O
seemed O
very O
strange O
to O
him, O
for O
Leon O
often O
threw O
himself O
back O
in O
his O
chair, O
and O
stretching O
out O
his O
arms. O
Complained O
vaguely O
of O
life. O
"It's O
because O
you O
don't O
take O
enough O
recreation," O
said O
the O
collector. O
"What O
recreation?" O
"If O
I O
were O
you O
I'd O
have O
a O
lathe." O
"But O
I O
don't O
know O
how O
to O
turn," O
answered O
the O
clerk. O
"Ah! O
that's O
true," O
said O
the O
other, O
rubbing O
his O
chin O
with O
an O
air O
of O
mingled O
contempt O
and O
satisfaction. O
Leon O
was O
weary O
of O
loving O
without O
any O
result; O
moreover O
he O
was O
beginning O
to O
feel O
that O
depression O
caused O
by O
the O
repetition O
of O
the O
same O
kind O
of O
life, O
when O
no O
interest O
inspires O
and O
no O
hope O
sustains O
it. O
He O
was O
so O
bored O
with O
Yonville O
and O
its O
inhabitants, O
that O
the O
sight O
of O
certain O
persons, O
of O
certain O
houses, O
irritated O
him O
beyond O
endurance; O
and O
the O
chemist, O
good O
fellow O
though O
he O
was, O
was O
becoming O
absolutely O
unbearable O
to O
him. O
Yet O
the O
prospect O
of O
a O
new O
condition O
of O
life O
frightened O
as O
much O
as O
it O
seduced O
him. O
This O
apprehension O
soon O
changed O
into O
impatience, O
and O
then O
Paris O
from O
afar O
sounded O
its O
fanfare O
of O
masked O
balls O
with O
the O
laugh O
of O
grisettes. O
As O
he O
was O
to O
finish O
reading O
there, O
why O
not O
set O
out O
at O
once? O
What O
prevented O
him? O
And O
he O
began O
making O
home-preparations; O
he O
arranged O
his O
occupations O
beforehand. O
He O
furnished O
in O
his O
head O
an O
apartment. O
He O
would O
lead O
an O
artist's O
life O
there! O
He O
would O
take O
lessons O
on O
the O
guitar! O
He O
would O
have O
a O
dressing-gown, O
a O
Basque O
cap, O
blue O
velvet O
slippers! O
He O
even O
already O
was O
admiring O
two O
crossed O
foils O
over O
his O
chimney-piece, O
with O
a O
death's O
head O
on O
the O
guitar O
above O
them. O
The O
difficulty O
was O
the O
consent O
of O
his O
mother; O
nothing, O
however, O
seemed O
more O
reasonable. O
Even O
his O
employer O
advised O
him O
to O
go O
to O
some O
other O
chambers O
where O
he O
could O
advance O
more O
rapidly. O
Taking O
a O
middle O
course, O
then, O
Leon O
looked O
for O
some O
place O
as O
second O
clerk O
at O
Rouen; O
found O
none, O
and O
at O
last O
wrote O
his O
mother O
a O
long O
letter O
full O
of O
details, O
in O
which O
he O
set O
forth O
the O
reasons O
for O
going O
to O
live O
at O
Paris O
immediately. O
She O
consented. O
He O
did O
not O
hurry. O
Every O
day O
for O
a O
month O
Hivert O
carried O
boxes, O
valises, O
parcels O
for O
him O
from O
Yonville O
to O
Rouen O
and O
from O
Rouen O
to O
Yonville; O
and O
when O
Leon O
had O
packed O
up O
his O
wardrobe, O
had O
his O
three O
arm-chairs O
restuffed, O
bought O
a O
stock O
of O
neckties, O
in O
a O
word, O
had O
made O
more O
preparations O
than O
for O
a O
voyage O
around O
the O
world, O
he O
put O
it O
off O
from O
week O
to O
week, O
until O
he O
received O
a O
second O
letter O
from O
his O
mother O
urging O
him O
to O
leave, O
since O
he O
wanted O
to O
pass O
his O
examination O
before O
the O
vacation. O
When O
the O
moment O
for O
the O
farewells O
had O
come, O
Madame O
Homais O
wept, O
Justin O
sobbed; O
Homais, O
as O
a O
man O
of O
nerve, O
concealed O
his O
emotion; O
he O
wished O
to O
carry O
his O
friend's O
overcoat O
himself O
as O
far O
as O
the O
gate O
of O
the O
notary, O
who O
was O
taking O
Leon O
to O
Rouen O
in O
his O
carriage. O
The O
latter O
had O
just O
time O
to O
bid O
farewell O
to O
Monsieur O
Bovary. O
When O
he O
reached O
the O
head O
of O
the O
stairs, O
he O
stopped, O
he O
was O
so O
out O
of O
breath. O
As O
he O
came O
in, O
Madame O
Bovary O
arose O
hurriedly. O
"It O
is O
I O
again!" O
said O
Leon. O
"I O
was O
sure O
of O
it!" O
She O
bit O
her O
lips, O
and O
a O
rush O
of O
blood O
flowing O
under O
her O
skin O
made O
her O
red O
from O
the O
roots O
of O
her O
hair O
to O
the O
top O
of O
her O
collar. O
She O
remained O
standing, O
leaning O
with O
her O
shoulder O
against O
the O
wainscot. O
"The O
doctor O
is O
not O
here?" O
he O
went O
on. O
"He O
is O
out." O
She O
repeated, O
"He O
is O
out." O
Then O
there O
was O
silence. O
They O
looked O
at O
one O
another O
and O
their O
thoughts, O
confounded O
in O
the O
same O
agony, O
clung O
close O
together O
like O
two O
throbbing O
breasts. O
"I O
should O
like O
to O
kiss O
Berthe," O
said O
Leon. O
Emma O
went O
down O
a O
few O
steps O
and O
called O
Felicite. O
He O
threw O
one O
long O
look O
around O
him O
that O
took O
in O
the O
walls, O
the O
decorations, O
the O
fireplace, O
as O
if O
to O
penetrate O
everything, O
carry O
away O
everything. O
But O
she O
returned, O
and O
the O
servant O
brought O
Berthe, O
who O
was O
swinging O
a O
windmill O
roof O
downwards O
at O
the O
end O
of O
a O
string. O
Leon O
kissed O
her O
several O
times O
on O
the O
neck. O
"Good-bye, O
poor O
child! O
good-bye, O
dear O
little O
one! O
good-bye!" O
And O
he O
gave O
her O
back O
to O
her O
mother. O
"Take O
her O
away," O
she O
said. O
They O
remained O
alone-- O
Madame O
Bovary, O
her O
back O
turned, O
her O
face O
pressed O
against O
a O
window-pane; O
Leon O
held O
his O
cap O
in O
his O
hand, O
knocking O
it O
softly O
against O
his O
thigh. O
"It O
is O
going O
to O
rain," O
said O
Emma. O
"I O
have O
a O
cloak," O
he O
answered. O
"Ah!" O
She O
turned O
around, O
her O
chin O
lowered, O
her O
forehead O
bent O
forward. O
The O
light O
fell O
on O
it O
as O
on O
a O
piece O
of O
marble, O
to O
the O
curve O
of O
the O
eyebrows, O
without O
one's O
being O
able O
to O
guess O
what O
Emma O
was O
seeing O
on O
the O
horizon O
or O
what O
she O
was O
thinking O
within O
herself. O
"Well, O
good-bye," O
he O
sighed. O
She O
raised O
her O
head O
with O
a O
quick O
movement. O
"Yes, O
good-bye-- O
go!" O
They O
advanced O
towards O
each O
other; O
he O
held O
out O
his O
hand; O
she O
hesitated. O
"In O
the O
English O
fashion, O
then," O
she O
said, O
giving O
her O
own O
hand O
wholly O
to O
him, O
and O
forcing O
a O
laugh. O
Leon O
felt O
it O
between O
his O
fingers, O
and O
the O
very O
essence O
of O
all O
his O
being O
seemed O
to O
pass O
down O
into O
that O
moist O
palm. O
Then O
he O
opened O
his O
hand; O
their O
eyes O
met O
again, O
and O
he O
disappeared. O
When O
he O
reached O
the O
market-place, O
he O
stopped O
and O
hid O
behind O
a O
pillar O
to O
look O
for O
the O
last O
time O
at O
this O
white O
house O
with O
the O
four O
green O
blinds. O
He O
thought O
he O
saw O
a O
shadow O
behind O
the O
window O
in O
the O
room; O
but O
the O
curtain, O
sliding O
along O
the O
pole O
as O
though O
no O
one O
were O
touching O
it, O
slowly O
opened O
its O
long O
oblique O
folds O
that O
spread O
out O
with O
a O
single O
movement, O
and O
thus O
hung O
straight O
and O
motionless O
as O
a O
plaster O
wall. O
Leon O
set O
off O
running. O
From O
afar O
he O
saw O
his O
employer's O
gig O
in O
the O
road, O
and O
by O
it O
a O
man O
in O
a O
coarse O
apron O
holding O
the O
horse. O
Homais O
and O
Monsieur O
Guillaumin O
were O
talking. O
They O
were O
waiting O
for O
him. O
"Embrace O
me," O
said O
the O
druggist O
with O
tears O
in O
his O
eyes. O
"Here O
is O
your O
coat, O
my O
good O
friend. O
Mind O
the O
cold; O
take O
care O
of O
yourself; O
look O
after O
yourself." O
"Come, O
Leon, O
jump O
in," O
said O
the O
notary. O
Homais O
bend O
over O
the O
splash-board, O
and O
in O
a O
voice O
broken O
by O
sobs O
uttered O
these O
three O
sad O
words-- O
"A O
pleasant O
journey!" O
"Good-night," O
said O
Monsieur O
Guillaumin. O
"Give O
him O
his O
head." O
They O
set O
out, O
and O
Homais O
went O
back. O
Madame O
Bovary O
had O
opened O
her O
window O
overlooking O
the O
garden O
and O
watched O
the O
clouds. O
They O
gathered O
around O
the O
sunset O
on O
the O
side O
of O
Rouen O
and O
then O
swiftly O
rolled O
back O
their O
black O
columns, O
behind O
which O
the O
great O
rays O
of O
the O
sun O
looked O
out O
like O
the O
golden O
arrows O
of O
a O
suspended O
trophy, O
while O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
empty O
heavens O
was O
white O
as O
porcelain. O
But O
a O
gust O
of O
wind O
bowed O
the O
poplars, O
and O
suddenly O
the O
rain O
fell; O
it O
pattered O
against O
the O
green O
leaves. O
Then O
the O
sun O
reappeared, O
the O
hens O
clucked, O
sparrows O
shook O
their O
wings O
in O
the O
damp O
thickets, O
and O
the O
pools O
of O
water O
on O
the O
gravel O
as O
they O
flowed O
away O
carried O
off O
the O
pink O
flowers O
of O
an O
acacia. O
"Ah! O
how O
far O
off O
he O
must O
be O
already!" O
she O
thought. O
Monsieur O
Homais, O
as O
usual, O
came O
at O
half-past O
six O
during O
dinner. O
"Well," O
said O
he, O
"so O
we've O
sent O
off O
our O
young O
friend!" O
"So O
it O
seems," O
replied O
the O
doctor. O
Then O
turning O
on O
his O
chair; O
"Any O
news O
at O
home?" O
"Nothing O
much. O
Only O
my O
wife O
was O
a O
little O
moved O
this O
afternoon. O
You O
know O
women O
-- O
a O
nothing O
upsets O
them, O
especially O
my O
wife. O
And O
we O
should O
be O
wrong O
to O
object O
to O
that, O
since O
their O
nervous O
organization O
is O
much O
more O
malleable O
than O
ours." O
"Poor O
Leon!" O
said O
Charles. O
"How O
will O
he O
live O
at O
Paris? O
Will O
he O
get O
used O
to O
it?" O
Madame O
Bovary O
sighed. O
"Get O
along!" O
said O
the O
chemist, O
smacking O
his O
lips. O
"The O
outings O
at O
restaurants, O
the O
masked O
balls, O
the O
champagne-- O
all O
that'll O
be O
jolly O
enough, O
I O
assure O
you." O
"I O
don't O
think O
he'll O
go O
wrong," O
objected O
Bovary. O
"Nor O
do O
I," O
said O
Monsieur O
Homais O
quickly; O
"although O
he'll O
have O
to O
do O
like O
the O
rest O
for O
fear O
of O
passing O
for O
a O
Jesuit. O
And O
you O
don't O
know O
what O
a O
life O
those O
dogs O
lead O
in O
the O
Latin O
quarter O
with O
actresses. O
Besides, O
students O
are O
thought O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
in O
Paris. O
Provided O
they O
have O
a O
few O
accomplishments, O
they O
are O
received O
in O
the O
best O
society; O
there O
are O
even O
ladies O
of O
the O
Faubourg O
Saint-Germain O
who O
fall O
in O
love O
with O
them, O
which O
subsequently O
furnishes O
them O
opportunities O
for O
making O
very O
good O
matches." O
"But," O
said O
the O
doctor, O
"I O
fear O
for O
him O
that O
down O
there O
-- O
" O
"You O
are O
right," O
interrupted O
the O
chemist; O
"that O
is O
the O
reverse O
of O
the O
medal. O
And O
one O
is O
constantly O
obliged O
to O
keep O
one's O
hand O
in O
one's O
pocket O
there. O
Thus, O
we O
will O
suppose O
you O
are O
in O
a O
public O
garden. O
An O
individual O
presents O
himself, O
well O
dressed, O
even O
wearing O
an O
order, O
and O
whom O
one O
would O
take O
for O
a O
diplomatist. O
He O
approaches O
you, O
he O
insinuates O
himself; O
offers O
you O
a O
pinch O
of O
snuff, O
or O
picks O
up O
your O
hat. O
Then O
you O
become O
more O
intimate; O
he O
takes O
you O
to O
a O
cafe, O
invites O
you O
to O
his O
country-house, O
introduces O
you, O
between O
two O
drinks, O
to O
all O
sorts O
of O
people; O
and O
three-fourths O
of O
the O
time O
it's O
only O
to O
plunder O
your O
watch O
or O
lead O
you O
into O
some O
pernicious O
step. O
 O
That O
is O
true," O
said O
Charles; O
"but O
I O
was O
thinking O
especially O
of O
illnesses-- O
of O
typhoid O
fever, O
for O
example, O
that O
attacks O
students O
from O
the O
provinces." O
Emma O
shuddered. O
"Because O
of O
the O
change O
of O
regimen," O
continued O
the O
chemist, O
"and O
of O
the O
perturbation O
that O
results O
therefrom O
in O
the O
whole O
system. O
And O
then O
the O
water O
at O
Paris, O
don't O
you O
know! O
The O
dishes O
at O
restaurants, O
all O
the O
spiced O
food, O
end O
by O
heating O
the O
blood, O
and O
are O
not O
worth, O
whatever O
people O
may O
say O
of O
them, O
a O
good O
soup. O
For O
my O
own O
part, O
I O
have O
always O
preferred O
plain O
living; O
it O
is O
more O
healthy. O
So O
when O
I O
was O
studying O
pharmacy O
at O
Rouen, O
I O
boarded O
in O
a O
boarding O
house; O
I O
dined O
with O
the O
professors." O
And O
thus O
he O
went O
on, O
expounding O
his O
opinions O
generally O
and O
his O
personal O
likings, O
until O
Justin O
came O
to O
fetch O
him O
for O
a O
mulled O
egg O
that O
was O
wanted. O
"Not O
a O
moment's O
peace!" O
he O
cried; O
"always O
at O
it! O
I O
can't O
go O
out O
for O
a O
minute! O
Like O
a O
plough-horse, O
I O
have O
always O
to O
be O
moiling O
and O
toiling. O
What O
drudgery!" O
Then, O
when O
he O
was O
at O
the O
door, O
"By O
the O
way, O
do O
you O
know O
the O
news?" O
"What O
news?" O
"That O
it O
is O
very O
likely," O
Homais O
went O
on, O
raising O
his O
eyebrows O
and O
assuming O
one O
of O
his O
most O
serious O
expression, O
"that O
the O
agricultural O
meeting O
of O
the O
Seine-Inferieure O
will O
be O
held O
this O
year O
at O
Yonville-l'Abbaye. O
The O
rumour, O
at O
all O
events, O
is O
going O
the O
round. O
This O
morning O
the O
paper O
alluded O
to O
it. O
It O
would O
be O
of O
the O
utmost O
importance O
for O
our O
district. O
But O
we'll O
talk O
it O
over O
later O
on. O
I O
can O
see, O
thank O
you; O
Justin O
has O
the O
lantern." O
CHAPTER O
SEVEN O
The O
next O
day O
was O
a O
dreary O
one O
for O
Emma. O
Everything O
seemed O
to O
her O
enveloped O
in O
a O
black O
atmosphere O
floating O
confusedly O
over O
the O
exterior O
of O
things, O
and O
sorrow O
was O
engulfed O
within O
her O
soul O
with O
soft O
shrieks O
such O
as O
the O
winter O
wind O
makes O
in O
ruined O
castles. O
It O
was O
that O
reverie O
which O
we O
give O
to O
things O
that O
will O
not O
return, O
the O
lassitude O
that O
seizes O
you O
after O
everything O
was O
done; O
that O
pain, O
in O
fine, O
that O
the O
interruption O
of O
every O
wonted O
movement, O
the O
sudden O
cessation O
of O
any O
prolonged O
vibration, O
brings O
on. O
As O
on O
the O
return O
from O
Vaubyessard, O
when O
the O
quadrilles O
were O
running O
in O
her O
head, O
she O
was O
full O
of O
a O
gloomy O
melancholy, O
of O
a O
numb O
despair. O
Leon O
reappeared, O
taller, O
handsomer, O
more O
charming, O
more O
vague. O
Though O
separated O
from O
her, O
he O
had O
not O
left O
her; O
he O
was O
there, O
and O
the O
walls O
of O
the O
house O
seemed O
to O
hold O
his O
shadow. O
She O
could O
not O
detach O
her O
eyes O
from O
the O
carpet O
where O
he O
had O
walked, O
from O
those O
empty O
chairs O
where O
he O
had O
sat. O
The O
river O
still O
flowed O
on, O
and O
slowly O
drove O
its O
ripples O
along O
the O
slippery O
banks. O
They O
had O
often O
walked O
there O
to O
the O
murmur O
of O
the O
waves O
over O
the O
moss-covered O
pebbles. O
How O
bright O
the O
sun O
had O
been! O
What O
happy O
afternoons O
they O
had O
seen O
alone O
in O
the O
shade O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
garden! O
He O
read O
aloud, O
bareheaded, O
sitting O
on O
a O
footstool O
of O
dry O
sticks; O
the O
fresh O
wind O
of O
the O
meadow O
set O
trembling O
the O
leaves O
of O
the O
book O
and O
the O
nasturtiums O
of O
the O
arbour. O
Ah! O
he O
was O
gone, O
the O
only O
charm O
of O
her O
life, O
the O
only O
possible O
hope O
of O
joy. O
Why O
had O
she O
not O
seized O
this O
happiness O
when O
it O
came O
to O
her? O
Why O
not O
have O
kept O
hold O
of O
it O
with O
both O
hands, O
with O
both O
knees, O
when O
it O
was O
about O
to O
flee O
from O
her? O
And O
she O
cursed O
herself O
for O
not O
having O
loved O
Leon. O
She O
thirsted O
for O
his O
lips. O
The O
wish O
took O
possession O
of O
her O
to O
run O
after O
and O
rejoin O
him, O
throw O
herself O
into O
his O
arms O
and O
say O
to O
him, O
"It O
is O
I; O
I O
am O
yours." O
But O
Emma O
recoiled O
beforehand O
at O
the O
difficulties O
of O
the O
enterprise, O
and O
her O
desires, O
increased O
by O
regret, O
became O
only O
the O
more O
acute. O
Henceforth O
the O
memory O
of O
Leon O
was O
the O
centre O
of O
her O
boredom; O
it O
burnt O
there O
more O
brightly O
than O
the O
fire O
travellers O
have O
left O
on O
the O
snow O
of O
a O
Russian O
steppe. O
She O
sprang O
towards O
him, O
she O
pressed O
against O
him, O
she O
stirred O
carefully O
the O
dying O
embers, O
sought O
all O
around O
her O
anything O
that O
could O
revive O
it; O
and O
the O
most O
distant O
reminiscences, O
like O
the O
most O
immediate O
occasions, O
what O
she O
experienced O
as O
well O
as O
what O
she O
imagined, O
her O
voluptuous O
desires O
that O
were O
unsatisfied, O
her O
projects O
of O
happiness O
that O
crackled O
in O
the O
wind O
like O
dead O
boughs, O
her O
sterile O
virtue, O
her O
lost O
hopes, O
the O
domestic O
tete-a-tete-- O
she O
gathered O
it O
all O
up, O
took O
everything, O
and O
made O
it O
all O
serve O
as O
fuel O
for O
her O
melancholy. O
The O
flames, O
however, O
subsided, O
either O
because O
the O
supply O
had O
exhausted O
itself, O
or O
because O
it O
had O
been O
piled O
up O
too O
much. O
Love, O
little O
by O
little, O
was O
quelled O
by O
absence; O
regret O
stifled O
beneath O
habit; O
and O
this O
incendiary O
light O
that O
had O
empurpled O
her O
pale O
sky O
was O
overspread O
and O
faded O
by O
degrees. O
In O
the O
supineness O
of O
her O
conscience O
she O
even O
took O
her O
repugnance O
towards O
her O
husband O
for O
aspirations O
towards O
her O
lover, O
the O
burning O
of O
hate O
for O
the O
warmth O
of O
tenderness; O
but O
as O
the O
tempest O
still O
raged, O
and O
as O
passion O
burnt O
itself O
down O
to O
the O
very O
cinders, O
and O
no O
help O
came, O
no O
sun O
rose, O
there O
was O
night O
on O
all O
sides, O
and O
she O
was O
lost O
in O
the O
terrible O
cold O
that O
pierced O
her. O
Then O
the O
evil O
days O
of O
Tostes O
began O
again. O
She O
thought O
herself O
now O
far O
more O
unhappy; O
for O
she O
had O
the O
experience O
of O
grief, O
with O
the O
certainty O
that O
it O
would O
not O
end. O
A O
woman O
who O
had O
laid O
on O
herself O
such O
sacrifices O
could O
well O
allow O
herself O
certain O
whims. O
She O
bought O
a O
Gothic O
prie-dieu, O
and O
in O
a O
month O
spent O
fourteen O
francs O
on O
lemons O
for O
polishing O
her O
nails; O
she O
wrote O
to O
Rouen O
for O
a O
blue O
cashmere O
gown; O
she O
chose O
one O
of O
Lheureux's O
finest O
scarves, O
and O
wore O
it O
knotted O
around O
her O
waist O
over O
her O
dressing-gown; O
and, O
with O
closed O
blinds O
and O
a O
book O
in O
her O
hand, O
she O
lay O
stretched O
out O
on O
a O
couch O
in O
this O
garb. O
She O
often O
changed O
her O
coiffure; O
she O
did O
her O
hair O
a O
la O
Chinoise, O
in O
flowing O
curls, O
in O
plaited O
coils; O
she O
parted O
in O
on O
one O
side O
and O
rolled O
it O
under O
like O
a O
man's. O
She O
wanted O
to O
learn O
Italian; O
she O
bought O
dictionaries, O
a O
grammar, O
and O
a O
supply O
of O
white O
paper. O
She O
tried O
serious O
reading, O
history, O
and O
philosophy. O
Sometimes O
in O
the O
night O
Charles O
woke O
up O
with O
a O
start, O
thinking O
he O
was O
being O
called O
to O
a O
patient. O
"I'm O
coming," O
he O
stammered; O
and O
it O
was O
the O
noise O
of O
a O
match O
Emma O
had O
struck O
to O
relight O
the O
lamp. O
But O
her O
reading O
fared O
like O
her O
piece O
of O
embroidery, O
all O
of O
which, O
only O
just O
begun, O
filled O
her O
cupboard; O
she O
took O
it O
up, O
left O
it, O
passed O
on O
to O
other O
books. O
She O
had O
attacks O
in O
which O
she O
could O
easily O
have O
been O
driven O
to O
commit O
any O
folly. O
She O
maintained O
one O
day, O
in O
opposition O
to O
her O
husband, O
that O
she O
could O
drink O
off O
a O
large O
glass O
of O
brandy, O
and, O
as O
Charles O
was O
stupid O
enough O
to O
dare O
her O
to, O
she O
swallowed O
the O
brandy O
to O
the O
last O
drop. O
In O
spite O
of O
her O
vapourish O
airs O
(as O
the O
housewives O
of O
Yonville O
called O
them), O
Emma, O
all O
the O
same, O
never O
seemed O
gay, O
and O
usually O
she O
had O
at O
the O
corners O
of O
her O
mouth O
that O
immobile O
contraction O
that O
puckers O
the O
faces O
of O
old O
maids, O
and O
those O
of O
men O
whose O
ambition O
has O
failed. O
She O
was O
pale O
all O
over, O
white O
as O
a O
sheet; O
the O
skin O
of O
her O
nose O
was O
drawn O
at O
the O
nostrils, O
her O
eyes O
looked O
at O
you O
vaguely. O
After O
discovering O
three O
grey O
hairs O
on O
her O
temples, O
she O
talked O
much O
of O
her O
old O
age. O
She O
often O
fainted. O
One O
day O
she O
even O
spat O
blood, O
and, O
as O
Charles O
fussed O
around O
her O
showing O
his O
anxiety-- O
"Bah!" O
she O
answered, O
"what O
does O
it O
matter?" O
Charles O
fled O
to O
his O
study O
and O
wept O
there, O
both O
his O
elbows O
on O
the O
table, O
sitting O
in O
an O
arm-chair O
at O
his O
bureau O
under O
the O
phrenological O
head. O
Then O
he O
wrote O
to O
his O
mother O
begging O
her O
to O
come, O
and O
they O
had O
many O
long O
consultations O
together O
on O
the O
subject O
of O
Emma. O
What O
should O
they O
decide? O
What O
was O
to O
be O
done O
since O
she O
rejected O
all O
medical O
treatment? O
"Do O
you O
know O
what O
your O
wife O
wants?" O
replied O
Madame O
Bovary O
senior. O
"She O
wants O
to O
be O
forced O
to O
occupy O
herself O
with O
some O
manual O
work. O
If O
she O
were O
obliged, O
like O
so O
many O
others, O
to O
earn O
her O
living, O
she O
wouldn't O
have O
these O
vapours, O
that O
come O
to O
her O
from O
a O
lot O
of O
ideas O
she O
stuffs O
into O
her O
head, O
and O
from O
the O
idleness O
in O
which O
she O
lives." O
"Yet O
she O
is O
always O
busy," O
said O
Charles. O
"Ah! O
always O
busy O
at O
what? O
Reading O
novels, O
bad O
books, O
works O
against O
religion, O
and O
in O
which O
they O
mock O
at O
priests O
in O
speeches O
taken O
from O
Voltaire. O
But O
all O
that O
leads O
you O
far O
astray, O
my O
poor O
child. O
Anyone O
who O
has O
no O
religion O
always O
ends O
by O
turning O
out O
badly." O
So O
it O
was O
decided O
to O
stop O
Emma O
reading O
novels. O
The O
enterprise O
did O
not O
seem O
easy. O
The O
good O
lady O
undertook O
it. O
She O
was, O
when O
she O
passed O
through O
Rouen, O
to O
go O
herself O
to O
the O
lending-library O
and O
represent O
that O
Emma O
had O
discontinued O
her O
subscription. O
Would O
they O
not O
have O
a O
right O
to O
apply O
to O
the O
police O
if O
the O
librarian O
persisted O
all O
the O
same O
in O
his O
poisonous O
trade? O
The O
farewells O
of O
mother O
and O
daughter-in-law O
were O
cold. O
During O
the O
three O
weeks O
that O
they O
had O
been O
together O
they O
had O
not O
exchanged O
half-a-dozen O
words O
apart O
from O
the O
inquiries O
and O
phrases O
when O
they O
met O
at O
table O
and O
in O
the O
evening O
before O
going O
to O
bed. O
Madame O
Bovary O
left O
on O
a O
Wednesday, O
the O
market-day O
at O
Yonville. O
The O
Place O
since O
morning O
had O
been O
blocked O
by O
a O
row O
of O
carts, O
which, O
on O
end O
and O
their O
shafts O
in O
the O
air, O
spread O
all O
along O
the O
line O
of O
houses O
from O
the O
church O
to O
the O
inn. O
On O
the O
other O
side O
there O
were O
canvas O
booths, O
where O
cotton O
checks, O
blankets, O
and O
woollen O
stockings O
were O
sold, O
together O
with O
harness O
for O
horses, O
and O
packets O
of O
blue O
ribbon, O
whose O
ends O
fluttered O
in O
the O
wind. O
The O
coarse O
hardware O
was O
spread O
out O
on O
the O
ground O
between O
pyramids O
of O
eggs O
and O
hampers O
of O
cheeses, O
from O
which O
sticky O
straw O
stuck O
out. O
Near O
the O
corn-machines O
clucking O
hens O
passed O
their O
necks O
through O
the O
bars O
of O
flat O
cages. O
The O
people, O
crowding O
in O
the O
same O
place O
and O
unwilling O
to O
move O
thence, O
sometimes O
threatened O
to O
smash O
the O
shop O
front O
of O
the O
chemist. O
On O
Wednesdays O
his O
shop O
was O
never O
empty, O
and O
the O
people O
pushed O
in O
less O
to O
buy O
drugs O
than O
for O
consultations. O
So O
great O
was O
Homais' O
reputation O
in O
the O
neighbouring O
villages. O
His O
robust O
aplomb O
had O
fascinated O
the O
rustics. O
They O
considered O
him O
a O
greater O
doctor O
than O
all O
the O
doctors. O
Emma O
was O
leaning O
out O
at O
the O
window; O
she O
was O
often O
there. O
The O
window O
in O
the O
provinces O
replaces O
the O
theatre O
and O
the O
promenade, O
she O
was O
amusing O
herself O
with O
watching O
the O
crowd O
of O
boors O
when O
she O
saw O
a O
gentleman O
in O
a O
green O
velvet O
coat. O
He O
had O
on O
yellow O
gloves, O
although O
he O
wore O
heavy O
gaiters; O
he O
was O
coming O
towards O
the O
doctor's O
house, O
followed O
by O
a O
peasant O
walking O
with O
a O
bent O
head O
and O
quite O
a O
thoughtful O
air. O
"Can O
I O
see O
the O
doctor?" O
he O
asked O
Justin, O
who O
was O
talking O
on O
the O
doorsteps O
with O
Felicite, O
and, O
taking O
him O
for O
a O
servant O
of O
the O
house-- O
"Tell O
him O
that O
Monsieur O
Rodolphe O
Boulanger O
of O
La O
Huchette O
is O
here." O
It O
was O
not O
from O
territorial O
vanity O
that O
the O
new O
arrival O
added O
"of O
La O
Huchette" O
to O
his O
name, O
but O
to O
make O
himself O
the O
better O
known. O
La O
Huchette, O
in O
fact, O
was O
an O
estate O
near O
Yonville, O
where O
he O
had O
just O
bought O
the O
chateau O
and O
two O
farms O
that O
he O
cultivated O
himself, O
without, O
however, O
troubling O
very O
much O
about O
them. O
He O
lived O
as O
a O
bachelor, O
and O
was O
supposed O
to O
have O
"at O
least O
fifteen O
thousand O
francs O
a O
year." O
Charles O
came O
into O
the O
room. O
Monsieur O
Boulanger O
introduced O
his O
man, O
who O
wanted O
to O
be O
bled O
because O
he O
felt O
"a O
tingling O
all O
over." O
"That'll O
purge O
me," O
he O
urged O
as O
an O
objection O
to O
all O
reasoning. O
So O
Bovary O
ordered O
a O
bandage O
and O
a O
basin, O
and O
asked O
Justin O
to O
hold O
it. O
Then O
addressing O
the O
peasant, O
who O
was O
already O
pale-- O
"Don't O
be O
afraid, O
my O
lad." O
"No, O
no, O
sir," O
said O
the O
other; O
"get O
on." O
And O
with O
an O
air O
of O
bravado O
he O
held O
out O
his O
great O
arm. O
At O
the O
prick O
of O
the O
lancet O
the O
blood O
spurted O
out, O
splashing O
against O
the O
looking-glass. O
"Hold O
the O
basin O
nearer," O
exclaimed O
Charles. O
"Lor!" O
said O
the O
peasant, O
"one O
would O
swear O
it O
was O
a O
little O
fountain O
flowing. O
How O
red O
my O
blood O
is! O
That's O
a O
good O
sign, O
isn't O
it?" O
"Sometimes," O
answered O
the O
doctor, O
"one O
feels O
nothing O
at O
first, O
and O
then O
syncope O
sets O
in, O
and O
more O
especially O
with O
people O
of O
strong O
constitution O
like O
this O
man." O
At O
these O
words O
the O
rustic O
let O
go O
the O
lancet-case O
he O
was O
twisting O
between O
his O
fingers. O
A O
shudder O
of O
his O
shoulders O
made O
the O
chair-back O
creak. O
His O
hat O
fell O
off. O
"I O
thought O
as O
much," O
said O
Bovary, O
pressing O
his O
finger O
on O
the O
vein. O
The O
basin O
was O
beginning O
to O
tremble O
in O
Justin's O
hands; O
his O
knees O
shook, O
he O
turned O
pale. O
"Emma! O
Emma!" O
called O
Charles. O
With O
one O
bound O
she O
came O
down O
the O
staircase. O
"Some O
vinegar," O
he O
cried. O
"O O
dear! O
two O
at O
once!" O
And O
in O
his O
emotion O
he O
could O
hardly O
put O
on O
the O
compress. O
"It O
is O
nothing," O
said O
Monsieur O
Boulanger O
quietly, O
taking O
Justin O
in O
his O
arms. O
He O
seated O
him O
on O
the O
table O
with O
his O
back O
resting O
against O
the O
wall. O
Madame O
Bovary O
began O
taking O
off O
his O
cravat. O
The O
strings O
of O
his O
shirt O
had O
got O
into O
a O
knot, O
and O
she O
was O
for O
some O
minutes O
moving O
her O
light O
fingers O
about O
the O
young O
fellow's O
neck. O
Then O
she O
poured O
some O
vinegar O
on O
her O
cambric O
handkerchief; O
she O
moistened O
his O
temples O
with O
little O
dabs, O
and O
then O
blew O
upon O
them O
softly. O
The O
ploughman O
revived, O
but O
Justin's O
syncope O
still O
lasted, O
and O
his O
eyeballs O
disappeared O
in O
the O
pale O
sclerotics O
like O
blue O
flowers O
in O
milk. O
"We O
must O
hide O
this O
from O
him," O
said O
Charles. O
Madame O
Bovary O
took O
the O
basin O
to O
put O
it O
under O
the O
table. O
With O
the O
movement O
she O
made O
in O
bending O
down, O
her O
dress O
(it O
was O
a O
summer O
dress O
with O
four O
flounces, O
yellow, O
long O
in O
the O
waist O
and O
wide O
in O
the O
skirt) O
spread O
out O
around O
her O
on O
the O
flags O
of O
the O
room; O
and O
as O
Emma O
stooping, O
staggered O
a O
little O
as O
she O
stretched O
out O
her O
arms. O
The O
stuff O
here O
and O
there O
gave O
with O
the O
inflections O
of O
her O
bust. O
Then O
she O
went O
to O
fetch O
a O
bottle O
of O
water, O
and O
she O
was O
melting O
some O
pieces O
of O
sugar O
when O
the O
chemist O
arrived. O
The O
servant O
had O
been O
to O
fetch O
him O
in O
the O
tumult. O
Seeing O
his O
pupil's O
eyes O
staring O
he O
drew O
a O
long O
breath; O
then O
going O
around O
him O
he O
looked O
at O
him O
from O
head O
to O
foot. O
"Fool!" O
he O
said, O
"really O
a O
little O
fool! O
A O
fool O
in O
four O
letters! O
A O
phlebotomy's O
a O
big O
affair, O
isn't O
it! O
And O
a O
fellow O
who O
isn't O
afraid O
of O
anything; O
a O
kind O
of O
squirrel, O
just O
as O
he O
is O
who O
climbs O
to O
vertiginous O
heights O
to O
shake O
down O
nuts. O
Oh, O
yes! O
you O
just O
talk O
to O
me, O
boast O
about O
yourself! O
Here's O
a O
fine O
fitness O
for O
practising O
pharmacy O
later O
on; O
for O
under O
serious O
circumstances O
you O
may O
be O
called O
before O
the O
tribunals O
in O
order O
to O
enlighten O
the O
minds O
of O
the O
magistrates, O
and O
you O
would O
have O
to O
keep O
your O
head O
then, O
to O
reason, O
show O
yourself O
a O
man, O
or O
else O
pass O
for O
an O
imbecile." O
Justin O
did O
not O
answer. O
The O
chemist O
went O
on-- O
"Who O
asked O
you O
to O
come? O
You O
are O
always O
pestering O
the O
doctor O
and O
madame. O
On O
Wednesday, O
moreover, O
your O
presence O
is O
indispensable O
to O
me. O
There O
are O
now O
twenty O
people O
in O
the O
shop. O
I O
left O
everything O
because O
of O
the O
interest O
I O
take O
in O
you. O
Come, O
get O
along! O
Sharp! O
Wait O
for O
me, O
and O
keep O
an O
eye O
on O
the O
jars." O
When O
Justin, O
who O
was O
rearranging O
his O
dress, O
had O
gone, O
they O
talked O
for O
a O
little O
while O
about O
fainting-fits. O
Madame O
Bovary O
had O
never O
fainted. O
"That O
is O
extraordinary O
for O
a O
lady," O
said O
Monsieur O
Boulanger; O
"but O
some O
people O
are O
very O
susceptible. O
Thus O
in O
a O
duel, O
I O
have O
seen O
a O
second O
lose O
consciousness O
at O
the O
mere O
sound O
of O
the O
loading O
of O
pistols." O
"For O
my O
part," O
said O
the O
chemist, O
"the O
sight O
of O
other O
people's O
blood O
doesn't O
affect O
me O
at O
all, O
but O
the O
mere O
thought O
of O
my O
own O
flowing O
would O
make O
me O
faint O
if O
I O
reflected O
upon O
it O
too O
much." O
Monsieur O
Boulanger, O
however, O
dismissed O
his O
servant, O
advising O
him O
to O
calm O
himself, O
since O
his O
fancy O
was O
over. O
"It O
procured O
me O
the O
advantage O
of O
making O
your O
acquaintance," O
he O
added, O
and O
he O
looked O
at O
Emma O
as O
he O
said O
this. O
Then O
he O
put O
three O
francs O
on O
the O
corner O
of O
the O
table, O
bowed O
negligently, O
and O
went O
out. O
He O
was O
soon O
on O
the O
other O
side O
of O
the O
river O
(this O
was O
his O
way O
back O
to O
La O
Huchette), O
and O
Emma O
saw O
him O
in O
the O
meadow, O
walking O
under O
the O
poplars, O
slackening O
his O
pace O
now O
and O
then O
as O
one O
who O
reflects. O
"She O
is O
very O
pretty," O
he O
said O
to O
himself; O
"she O
is O
very O
pretty, O
this O
doctor's O
wife. O
Fine O
teeth, O
black O
eyes, O
a O
dainty O
foot, O
a O
figure O
like O
a O
Parisienne's. O
Where O
the O
devil O
does O
she O
come O
from? O
Wherever O
did O
that O
fat O
fellow O
pick O
her O
up?" O
Monsieur O
Rodolphe O
Boulanger O
was O
thirty-four; O
he O
was O
of O
brutal O
temperament O
and O
intelligent O
perspicacity, O
having, O
moreover, O
had O
much O
to O
do O
with O
women, O
and O
knowing O
them O
well. O
This O
one O
had O
seemed O
pretty O
to O
him; O
so O
he O
was O
thinking O
about O
her O
and O
her O
husband. O
"I O
think O
he O
is O
very O
stupid. O
She O
is O
tired O
of O
him, O
no O
doubt. O
He O
has O
dirty O
nails, O
and O
hasn't O
shaved O
for O
three O
days. O
While O
he O
is O
trotting O
after O
his O
patients, O
she O
sits O
there O
botching O
socks. O
And O
she O
gets O
bored! O
She O
would O
like O
to O
live O
in O
town O
and O
dance O
polkas O
every O
evening. O
Poor O
little O
woman! O
She O
is O
gaping O
after O
love O
like O
a O
carp O
after O
water O
on O
a O
kitchen-table. O
With O
three O
words O
of O
gallantry O
she'd O
adore O
one, O
I'm O
sure O
of O
it. O
She'd O
be O
tender, O
charming. O
Yes; O
but O
how O
to O
get O
rid O
of O
her O
afterwards?" O
Then O
the O
difficulties O
of O
love-making O
seen O
in O
the O
distance O
made O
him O
by O
contrast O
think O
of O
his O
mistress. O
She O
was O
an O
actress O
at O
Rouen, O
whom O
he O
kept; O
and O
when O
he O
had O
pondered O
over O
this O
image, O
with O
which, O
even O
in O
remembrance, O
he O
was O
satiated-- O
"Ah! O
Madame O
Bovary," O
he O
thought, O
"is O
much O
prettier, O
especially O
fresher. O
Virginie O
is O
decidedly O
beginning O
to O
grow O
fat. O
She O
is O
so O
finiky O
about O
her O
pleasures; O
and, O
besides, O
she O
has O
a O
mania O
for O
prawns." O
The O
fields O
were O
empty, O
and O
around O
him O
Rodolphe O
only O
heard O
the O
regular O
beating O
of O
the O
grass O
striking O
against O
his O
boots, O
with O
a O
cry O
of O
the O
grasshopper O
hidden O
at O
a O
distance O
among O
the O
oats. O
He O
again O
saw O
Emma O
in O
her O
room, O
dressed O
as O
he O
had O
seen O
her, O
and O
he O
undressed O
her. O
"Oh, O
I O
will O
have O
her," O
he O
cried, O
striking O
a O
blow O
with O
his O
stick O
at O
a O
clod O
in O
front O
of O
him. O
And O
he O
at O
once O
began O
to O
consider O
the O
political O
part O
of O
the O
enterprise. O
He O
asked O
himself-- O
"Where O
shall O
we O
meet? O
By O
what O
means? O
We O
shall O
always O
be O
having O
the O
brat O
on O
our O
hands, O
and O
the O
servant, O
the O
neighbours, O
and O
husband, O
all O
sorts O
of O
worries. O
Pshaw! O
one O
would O
lose O
too O
much O
time O
over O
it." O
Then O
he O
resumed, O
"She O
really O
has O
eyes O
that O
pierce O
one's O
heart O
like O
a O
gimlet. O
And O
that O
pale O
complexion! O
I O
adore O
pale O
women!" O
When O
he O
reached O
the O
top O
of O
the O
Arguiel O
hills O
he O
had O
made O
up O
his O
mind. O
"It's O
only O
finding O
the O
opportunities. O
Well, O
I O
will O
call O
in O
now O
and O
then. O
I'll O
send O
them O
venison, O
poultry; O
I'll O
have O
myself O
bled, O
if O
need O
be. O
We O
shall O
become O
friends; O
I'll O
invite O
them O
to O
my O
place. O
By O
Jove!" O
added O
he, O
"there's O
the O
agricultural O
show O
coming O
on. O
She'll O
be O
there. O
I O
shall O
see O
her. O
We'll O
begin O
boldly, O
for O
that's O
the O
surest O
way." O
CHAPTER O
EIGHT O
At O
last O
it O
came, O
the O
famous O
agricultural O
show. O
On O
the O
morning O
of O
the O
solemnity O
all O
the O
inhabitants O
at O
their O
doors O
were O
chatting O
over O
the O
preparations. O
The O
pediment O
of O
the O
town O
hall O
had O
been O
hung O
with O
garlands O
of O
ivy; O
a O
tent O
had O
been O
erected O
in O
a O
meadow O
for O
the O
banquet; O
and O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
Place, O
in O
front O
of O
the O
church, O
a O
kind O
of O
bombarde O
was O
to O
announce O
the O
arrival O
of O
the O
prefect O
and O
the O
names O
of O
the O
successful O
farmers O
who O
had O
obtained O
prizes. O
The O
National O
Guard O
of O
Buchy O
(there O
was O
none O
at O
Yonville) O
had O
come O
to O
join O
the O
corps O
of O
firemen, O
of O
whom O
Binet O
was O
captain. O
On O
that O
day O
he O
wore O
a O
collar O
even O
higher O
than O
usual; O
and, O
tightly O
buttoned O
in O
his O
tunic, O
his O
figure O
was O
so O
stiff O
and O
motionless O
that O
the O
whole O
vital O
portion O
of O
his O
person O
seemed O
to O
have O
descended O
into O
his O
legs, O
which O
rose O
in O
a O
cadence O
of O
set O
steps O
with O
a O
single O
movement. O
As O
there O
was O
some O
rivalry O
between O
the O
tax-collector O
and O
the O
colonel, O
both, O
to O
show O
off O
their O
talents, O
drilled O
their O
men O
separately. O
One O
saw O
the O
red O
epaulettes O
and O
the O
black O
breastplates O
pass O
and O
re-pass O
alternately; O
there O
was O
no O
end O
to O
it, O
and O
it O
constantly O
began O
again. O
There O
had O
never O
been O
such O
a O
display O
of O
pomp. O
Several O
citizens O
had O
scoured O
their O
houses O
the O
evening O
before; O
tri-coloured O
flags O
hung O
from O
half-open O
windows; O
all O
the O
public-houses O
were O
full; O
and O
in O
the O
lovely O
weather O
the O
starched O
caps, O
the O
golden O
crosses, O
and O
the O
coloured O
neckerchiefs O
seemed O
whiter O
than O
snow, O
shone O
in O
the O
sun, O
and O
relieved O
with O
the O
motley O
colours O
the O
sombre O
monotony O
of O
the O
frock-coats O
and O
blue O
smocks. O
The O
neighbouring O
farmers' O
wives, O
when O
they O
got O
off O
their O
horses, O
pulled O
out O
the O
long O
pins O
that O
fastened O
around O
them O
their O
dresses, O
turned O
up O
for O
fear O
of O
mud; O
and O
the O
husbands, O
for O
their O
part, O
in O
order O
to O
save O
their O
hats, O
kept O
their O
handkerchiefs O
around O
them, O
holding O
one O
corner O
between O
their O
teeth. O
The O
crowd O
came O
into O
the O
main O
street O
from O
both O
ends O
of O
the O
village. O
People O
poured O
in O
from O
the O
lanes, O
the O
alleys, O
the O
houses; O
and O
from O
time O
to O
time O
one O
heard O
knockers O
banging O
against O
doors O
closing O
behind O
women O
with O
their O
gloves, O
who O
were O
going O
out O
to O
see O
the O
fete. O
What O
was O
most O
admired O
were O
two O
long O
lamp-stands O
covered O
with O
lanterns, O
that O
flanked O
a O
platform O
on O
which O
the O
authorities O
were O
to O
sit. O
Besides O
this O
there O
were O
against O
the O
four O
columns O
of O
the O
town O
hall O
four O
kinds O
of O
poles, O
each O
bearing O
a O
small O
standard O
of O
greenish O
cloth, O
embellished O
with O
inscriptions O
in O
gold O
letters. O
On O
one O
was O
written, O
"To O
Commerce"; O
on O
the O
other, O
"To O
Agriculture"; O
on O
the O
third, O
"To O
Industry"; O
and O
on O
the O
fourth, O
"To O
the O
Fine O
Arts." O
But O
the O
jubilation O
that O
brightened O
all O
faces O
seemed O
to O
darken O
that O
of O
Madame O
Lefrancois, O
the O
innkeeper. O
Standing O
on O
her O
kitchen-steps O
she O
muttered O
to O
herself, O
"What O
rubbish! O
what O
rubbish! O
With O
their O
canvas O
booth! O
Do O
they O
think O
the O
prefect O
will O
be O
glad O
to O
dine O
down O
there O
under O
a O
tent O
like O
a O
gipsy? O
They O
call O
all O
this O
fussing O
doing O
good O
to O
the O
place! O
Then O
it O
wasn't O
worth O
while O
sending O
to O
Neufchatel O
for O
the O
keeper O
of O
a O
cookshop! O
And O
for O
whom? O
For O
cowherds! O
tatterdemalions!" O
The O
druggist O
was O
passing. O
He O
had O
on O
a O
frock-coat, O
nankeen O
trousers, O
beaver O
shoes, O
and, O
for O
a O
wonder, O
a O
hat O
with O
a O
low O
crown. O
"Your O
servant! O
Excuse O
me, O
I O
am O
in O
a O
hurry." O
And O
as O
the O
fat O
widow O
asked O
where O
he O
was O
going-- O
"It O
seems O
odd O
to O
you, O
doesn't O
it, O
I O
who O
am O
always O
more O
cooped O
up O
in O
my O
laboratory O
than O
the O
man's O
rat O
in O
his O
cheese." O
"What O
cheese?" O
asked O
the O
landlady. O
"Oh, O
nothing! O
nothing!" O
Homais O
continued. O
"I O
merely O
wished O
to O
convey O
to O
you, O
Madame O
Lefrancois, O
that O
I O
usually O
live O
at O
home O
like O
a O
recluse. O
To-day, O
however, O
considering O
the O
circumstances, O
it O
is O
necessary O
-- O
" O
"Oh, O
you're O
going O
down O
there!" O
she O
said O
contemptuously. O
"Yes, O
I O
am O
going," O
replied O
the O
druggist, O
astonished. O
"Am O
I O
not O
a O
member O
of O
the O
consulting O
commission?" O
Mere O
Lefrancois O
looked O
at O
him O
for O
a O
few O
moments, O
and O
ended O
by O
saying O
with O
a O
smile-- O
"That's O
another O
pair O
of O
shoes! O
But O
what O
does O
agriculture O
matter O
to O
you? O
Do O
you O
understand O
anything O
about O
it?" O
"Certainly O
I O
understand O
it, O
since O
I O
am O
a O
druggist-- O
that O
is O
to O
say, O
a O
chemist. O
And O
the O
object O
of O
chemistry, O
Madame O
Lefrancois, O
being O
the O
knowledge O
of O
the O
reciprocal O
and O
molecular O
action O
of O
all O
natural O
bodies, O
it O
follows O
that O
agriculture O
is O
comprised O
within O
its O
domain. O
And, O
in O
fact, O
the O
composition O
of O
the O
manure, O
the O
fermentation O
of O
liquids, O
the O
analyses O
of O
gases, O
and O
the O
influence O
of O
miasmata, O
what, O
I O
ask O
you, O
is O
all O
this, O
if O
it O
isn't O
chemistry, O
pure O
and O
simple?" O
The O
landlady O
did O
not O
answer. O
Homais O
went O
on-- O
"Do O
you O
think O
that O
to O
be O
an O
agriculturist O
it O
is O
necessary O
to O
have O
tilled O
the O
earth O
or O
fattened O
fowls O
oneself? O
It O
is O
necessary O
rather O
to O
know O
the O
composition O
of O
the O
substances O
in O
question-- O
the O
geological O
strata, O
the O
atmospheric O
actions, O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
soil, O
the O
minerals, O
the O
waters, O
the O
density O
of O
the O
different O
bodies, O
their O
capillarity, O
and O
what O
not. O
And O
one O
must O
be O
master O
of O
all O
the O
principles O
of O
hygiene O
in O
order O
to O
direct, O
criticize O
the O
construction O
of O
buildings, O
the O
feeding O
of O
animals, O
the O
diet O
of O
domestics. O
And, O
moreover, O
Madame O
Lefrancois, O
one O
must O
know O
botany, O
be O
able O
to O
distinguish O
between O
plants, O
you O
understand, O
which O
are O
the O
wholesome O
and O
those O
that O
are O
deleterious, O
which O
are O
unproductive O
and O
which O
nutritive, O
if O
it O
is O
well O
to O
pull O
them O
up O
here O
and O
re-sow O
them O
there, O
to O
propagate O
some, O
destroy O
others; O
in O
brief, O
one O
must O
keep O
pace O
with O
science O
by O
means O
of O
pamphlets O
and O
public O
papers, O
be O
always O
on O
the O
alert O
to O
find O
out O
improvements." O
The O
landlady O
never O
took O
her O
eyes O
off O
the O
"Cafe O
Francois" O
and O
the O
chemist O
went O
on-- O
"Would O
to O
God O
our O
agriculturists O
were O
chemists, O
or O
that O
at O
least O
they O
would O
pay O
more O
attention O
to O
the O
counsels O
of O
science. O
Thus O
lately O
I O
myself O
wrote O
a O
considerable O
tract, O
a O
memoir O
of O
over O
seventy-two O
pages, O
entitled, O
'Cider, O
its O
Manufacture O
and O
its O
Effects, O
together O
with O
some O
New O
Reflections O
on O
the O
Subject,' O
that O
I O
sent O
to O
the O
Agricultural O
Society O
of O
Rouen, O
and O
which O
even O
procured O
me O
the O
honour O
of O
being O
received O
among O
its O
members-- O
Section, O
Agriculture; O
Class, O
Pomological. O
Well, O
if O
my O
work O
had O
been O
given O
to O
the O
public O
-- O
" O
But O
the O
druggist O
stopped, O
Madame O
Lefrancois O
seemed O
so O
preoccupied. O
"Just O
look O
at O
them!" O
she O
said. O
"It's O
past O
comprehension! O
Such O
a O
cookshop O
as O
that!" O
And O
with O
a O
shrug O
of O
the O
shoulders O
that O
stretched O
out O
over O
her O
breast O
the O
stitches O
of O
her O
knitted O
bodice, O
she O
pointed O
with O
both O
hands O
at O
her O
rival's O
inn, O
whence O
songs O
were O
heard O
issuing. O
"Well, O
it O
won't O
last O
long," O
she O
added. O
"It'll O
be O
over O
before O
a O
week." O
Homais O
drew O
back O
with O
stupefaction. O
She O
came O
down O
three O
steps O
and O
whispered O
in O
his O
ear-- O
"What! O
you O
didn't O
know O
it? O
There O
is O
to O
be O
an O
execution O
in O
next O
week. O
It's O
Lheureux O
who O
is O
selling O
him O
out; O
he O
has O
killed O
him O
with O
bills." O
"What O
a O
terrible O
catastrophe!" O
cried O
the O
druggist, O
who O
always O
found O
expressions O
in O
harmony O
with O
all O
imaginable O
circumstances. O
Then O
the O
landlady O
began O
telling O
him O
the O
story O
that O
she O
had O
heard O
from O
Theodore, O
Monsieur O
Guillaumin's O
servant, O
and O
although O
she O
detested O
Tellier, O
she O
blamed O
Lheureux. O
He O
was O
"a O
wheedler, O
a O
sneak." O
"There!" O
she O
said. O
"Look O
at O
him! O
he O
is O
in O
the O
market; O
he O
is O
bowing O
to O
Madame O
Bovary, O
who's O
got O
on O
a O
green O
bonnet. O
Why, O
she's O
taking O
Monsieur O
Boulanger's O
arm." O
"Madame O
Bovary!" O
exclaimed O
Homais. O
"I O
must O
go O
at O
once O
and O
pay O
her O
my O
respects. O
Perhaps O
she'll O
be O
very O
glad O
to O
have O
a O
seat O
in O
the O
enclosure O
under O
the O
peristyle." O
And, O
without O
heeding O
Madame O
Lefrancois, O
who O
was O
calling O
him O
back O
to O
tell O
him O
more O
about O
it, O
the O
druggist O
walked O
off O
rapidly O
with O
a O
smile O
on O
his O
lips, O
with O
straight O
knees, O
bowing O
copiously O
to O
right O
and O
left, O
and O
taking O
up O
much O
room O
with O
the O
large O
tails O
of O
his O
frock-coat O
that O
fluttered O
behind O
him O
in O
the O
wind. O
Rodolphe, O
having O
caught O
sight O
of O
him O
from O
afar, O
hurried O
on, O
but O
Madame O
Bovary O
lost O
her O
breath; O
so O
he O
walked O
more O
slowly, O
and, O
smiling O
at O
her, O
said O
in O
a O
rough O
tone-- O
"It's O
only O
to O
get O
away O
from O
that O
fat O
fellow, O
you O
know, O
the O
druggist." O
She O
pressed O
his O
elbow. O
"What's O
the O
meaning O
of O
that?" O
he O
asked O
himself. O
And O
he O
looked O
at O
her O
out O
of O
the O
corner O
of O
his O
eyes. O
Her O
profile O
was O
so O
calm O
that O
one O
could O
guess O
nothing O
from O
it. O
It O
stood O
out O
in O
the O
light O
from O
the O
oval O
of O
her O
bonnet, O
with O
pale O
ribbons O
on O
it O
like O
the O
leaves O
of O
weeds. O
Her O
eyes O
with O
their O
long O
curved O
lashes O
looked O
straight O
before O
her, O
and O
though O
wide O
open, O
they O
seemed O
slightly O
puckered O
by O
the O
cheek-bones, O
because O
of O
the O
blood O
pulsing O
gently O
under O
the O
delicate O
skin. O
A O
pink O
line O
ran O
along O
the O
partition O
between O
her O
nostrils. O
Her O
head O
was O
bent O
upon O
her O
shoulder, O
and O
the O
pearl O
tips O
of O
her O
white O
teeth O
were O
seen O
between O
her O
lips. O
"Is O
she O
making O
fun O
of O
me?" O
thought O
Rodolphe. O
Emma's O
gesture, O
however, O
had O
only O
been O
meant O
for O
a O
warning; O
for O
Monsieur O
Lheureux O
was O
accompanying O
them, O
and O
spoke O
now O
and O
again O
as O
if O
to O
enter O
into O
the O
conversation. O
"What O
a O
superb O
day! O
Everybody O
is O
out! O
The O
wind O
is O
east!" O
And O
neither O
Madame O
Bovary O
nor O
Rodolphe O
answered O
him, O
whilst O
at O
the O
slightest O
movement O
made O
by O
them O
he O
drew O
near, O
saying, O
"I O
beg O
your O
pardon!" O
and O
raised O
his O
hat. O
When O
they O
reached O
the O
farrier's O
house, O
instead O
of O
following O
the O
road O
up O
to O
the O
fence, O
Rodolphe O
suddenly O
turned O
down O
a O
path, O
drawing O
with O
him O
Madame O
Bovary. O
He O
called O
out-- O
"Good O
evening, O
Monsieur O
Lheureux! O
See O
you O
again O
presently." O
"How O
you O
got O
rid O
of O
him!" O
she O
said, O
laughing. O
"Why," O
he O
went O
on, O
"allow O
oneself O
to O
be O
intruded O
upon O
by O
others? O
And O
as O
to-day O
I O
have O
the O
happiness O
of O
being O
with O
you O
-- O
" O
Emma O
blushed. O
He O
did O
not O
finish O
his O
sentence. O
Then O
he O
talked O
of O
the O
fine O
weather O
and O
of O
the O
pleasure O
of O
walking O
on O
the O
grass. O
A O
few O
daisies O
had O
sprung O
up O
again. O
"Here O
are O
some O
pretty O
Easter O
daisies," O
he O
said, O
"and O
enough O
of O
them O
to O
furnish O
oracles O
to O
all O
the O
amorous O
maids O
in O
the O
place." O
He O
added, O
"Shall O
I O
pick O
some? O
What O
do O
you O
think?" O
"Are O
you O
in O
love?" O
she O
asked, O
coughing O
a O
little. O
"H'm, O
h'm! O
who O
knows?" O
answered O
Rodolphe. O
The O
meadow O
began O
to O
fill, O
and O
the O
housewives O
hustled O
you O
with O
their O
great O
umbrellas, O
their O
baskets, O
and O
their O
babies. O
One O
had O
often O
to O
get O
out O
of O
the O
way O
of O
a O
long O
file O
of O
country O
folk, O
servant-maids O
with O
blue O
stockings, O
flat O
shoes, O
silver O
rings, O
and O
who O
smelt O
of O
milk, O
when O
one O
passed O
close O
to O
them. O
They O
walked O
along O
holding O
one O
another O
by O
the O
hand, O
and O
thus O
they O
spread O
over O
the O
whole O
field O
from O
the O
row O
of O
open O
trees O
to O
the O
banquet O
tent. O
But O
this O
was O
the O
examination O
time, O
and O
the O
farmers O
one O
after O
the O
other O
entered O
a O
kind O
of O
enclosure O
formed O
by O
a O
long O
cord O
supported O
on O
sticks. O
The O
beasts O
were O
there, O
their O
noses O
towards O
the O
cord, O
and O
making O
a O
confused O
line O
with O
their O
unequal O
rumps. O
Drowsy O
pigs O
were O
burrowing O
in O
the O
earth O
with O
their O
snouts, O
calves O
were O
bleating, O
lambs O
baaing; O
the O
cows, O
on O
knees O
folded O
in, O
were O
stretching O
their O
bellies O
on O
the O
grass, O
slowly O
chewing O
the O
cud, O
and O
blinking O
their O
heavy O
eyelids O
at O
the O
gnats O
that O
buzzed O
round O
them. O
Plough-men O
with O
bare O
arms O
were O
holding O
by O
the O
halter O
prancing O
stallions O
that O
neighed O
with O
dilated O
nostrils O
looking O
towards O
the O
mares. O
These O
stood O
quietly, O
stretching O
out O
their O
heads O
and O
flowing O
manes, O
while O
their O
foals O
rested O
in O
their O
shadow, O
or O
now O
and O
then O
came O
and O
sucked O
them. O
And O
above O
the O
long O
undulation O
of O
these O
crowded O
animals O
one O
saw O
some O
white O
mane O
rising O
in O
the O
wind O
like O
a O
wave, O
or O
some O
sharp O
horns O
sticking O
out, O
and O
the O
heads O
of O
men O
running O
about. O
Apart, O
outside O
the O
enclosure, O
a O
hundred O
paces O
off, O
was O
a O
large O
black O
bull, O
muzzled, O
with O
an O
iron O
ring O
in O
its O
nostrils, O
and O
who O
moved O
no O
more O
than O
if O
he O
had O
been O
in O
bronze. O
A O
child O
in O
rags O
was O
holding O
him O
by O
a O
rope. O
Between O
the O
two O
lines O
the O
committee-men O
were O
walking O
with O
heavy O
steps, O
examining O
each O
animal, O
then O
consulting O
one O
another O
in O
a O
low O
voice. O
One O
who O
seemed O
of O
more O
importance O
now O
and O
then O
took O
notes O
in O
a O
book O
as O
he O
walked O
along. O
This O
was O
the O
president O
of O
the O
jury, O
Monsieur O
Derozerays O
de O
la O
Panville. O
As O
soon O
as O
he O
recognised O
Rodolphe O
he O
came O
forward O
quickly, O
and O
smiling O
amiably, O
said-- O
"What! O
Monsieur O
Boulanger, O
you O
are O
deserting O
us?" O
Rodolphe O
protested O
that O
he O
was O
just O
coming. O
But O
when O
the O
president O
had O
disappeared-- O
"Ma O
foi!" O
said O
he, O
"I O
shall O
not O
go. O
Your O
company O
is O
better O
than O
his." O
UPON O
MY O
WORD! O
And O
while O
poking O
fun O
at O
the O
show, O
Rodolphe, O
to O
move O
about O
more O
easily, O
showed O
the O
gendarme O
his O
blue O
card, O
and O
even O
stopped O
now O
and O
then O
in O
front O
of O
some O
fine O
beast, O
which O
Madame O
Bovary O
did O
not O
at O
all O
admire. O
He O
noticed O
this, O
and O
began O
jeering O
at O
the O
Yonville O
ladies O
and O
their O
dresses; O
then O
he O
apologised O
for O
the O
negligence O
of O
his O
own. O
He O
had O
that O
incongruity O
of O
common O
and O
elegant O
in O
which O
the O
habitually O
vulgar O
think O
they O
see O
the O
revelation O
of O
an O
eccentric O
existence, O
of O
the O
perturbations O
of O
sentiment, O
the O
tyrannies O
of O
art, O
and O
always O
a O
certain O
contempt O
for O
social O
conventions, O
that O
seduces O
or O
exasperates O
them. O
Thus O
his O
cambric O
shirt O
with O
plaited O
cuffs O
was O
blown O
out O
by O
the O
wind O
in O
the O
opening O
of O
his O
waistcoat O
of O
grey O
ticking, O
and O
his O
broad-striped O
trousers O
disclosed O
at O
the O
ankle O
nankeen O
boots O
with O
patent O
leather O
gaiters. O
These O
were O
so O
polished O
that O
they O
reflected O
the O
grass. O
He O
trampled O
on O
horses's O
dung O
with O
them, O
one O
hand O
in O
the O
pocket O
of O
his O
jacket O
and O
his O
straw O
hat O
on O
one O
side. O
"Besides," O
added O
he, O
"when O
one O
lives O
in O
the O
country O
-- O
" O
"It's O
waste O
of O
time," O
said O
Emma. O
"That O
is O
true," O
replied O
Rodolphe. O
"To O
think O
that O
not O
one O
of O
these O
people O
is O
capable O
of O
understanding O
even O
the O
cut O
of O
a O
coat!" O
Then O
they O
talked O
about O
provincial O
mediocrity, O
of O
the O
lives O
it O
crushed, O
the O
illusions O
lost O
there. O
"And O
I O
too," O
said O
Rodolphe, O
"am O
drifting O
into O
depression." O
"You!" O
she O
said O
in O
astonishment; O
"I O
thought O
you O
very O
light-hearted." O
"Ah! O
yes. O
I O
seem O
so, O
because O
in O
the O
midst O
of O
the O
world O
I O
know O
how O
to O
wear O
the O
mask O
of O
a O
scoffer O
upon O
my O
face; O
and O
yet, O
how O
many O
a O
time O
at O
the O
sight O
of O
a O
cemetery O
by O
moonlight O
have O
I O
not O
asked O
myself O
whether O
it O
were O
not O
better O
to O
join O
those O
sleeping O
there!" O
"Oh! O
and O
your O
friends?" O
she O
said. O
"You O
do O
not O
think O
of O
them." O
"My O
friends! O
What O
friends? O
Have O
I O
any? O
Who O
cares O
for O
me?" O
And O
he O
accompanied O
the O
last O
words O
with O
a O
kind O
of O
whistling O
of O
the O
lips. O
But O
they O
were O
obliged O
to O
separate O
from O
each O
other O
because O
of O
a O
great O
pile O
of O
chairs O
that O
a O
man O
was O
carrying O
behind O
them. O
He O
was O
so O
overladen O
with O
them O
that O
one O
could O
only O
see O
the O
tips O
of O
his O
wooden O
shoes O
and O
the O
ends O
of O
his O
two O
outstretched O
arms. O
It O
was O
Lestiboudois, O
the O
gravedigger, O
who O
was O
carrying O
the O
church O
chairs O
about O
amongst O
the O
people. O
Alive O
to O
all O
that O
concerned O
his O
interests, O
he O
had O
hit O
upon O
this O
means O
of O
turning O
the O
show O
to O
account; O
and O
his O
idea O
was O
succeeding, O
for O
he O
no O
longer O
knew O
which O
way O
to O
turn. O
In O
fact, O
the O
villagers, O
who O
were O
hot, O
quarreled O
for O
these O
seats, O
whose O
straw O
smelt O
of O
incense, O
and O
they O
leant O
against O
the O
thick O
backs, O
stained O
with O
the O
wax O
of O
candles, O
with O
a O
certain O
veneration. O
Madame O
Bovary O
again O
took O
Rodolphe's O
arm; O
he O
went O
on O
as O
if O
speaking O
to O
himself-- O
"Yes, O
I O
have O
missed O
so O
many O
things. O
Always O
alone! O
Ah! O
if O
I O
had O
some O
aim O
in O
life, O
if O
I O
had O
met O
some O
love, O
if O
I O
had O
found O
someone! O
Oh, O
how O
I O
would O
have O
spent O
all O
the O
energy O
of O
which O
I O
am O
capable, O
surmounted O
everything, O
overcome O
everything!" O
"Yet O
it O
seems O
to O
me," O
said O
Emma, O
"that O
you O
are O
not O
to O
be O
pitied." O
"Ah! O
you O
think O
so?" O
said O
Rodolphe. O
"For, O
after O
all," O
she O
went O
on, O
"you O
are O
free O
-- O
" O
she O
hesitated, O
"rich O
-- O
" O
"Do O
not O
mock O
me," O
he O
replied. O
And O
she O
protested O
that O
she O
was O
not O
mocking O
him, O
when O
the O
report O
of O
a O
cannon O
resounded. O
Immediately O
all O
began O
hustling O
one O
another O
pell-mell O
towards O
the O
village. O
It O
was O
a O
false O
alarm. O
The O
prefect O
seemed O
not O
to O
be O
coming, O
and O
the O
members O
of O
the O
jury O
felt O
much O
embarrassed, O
not O
knowing O
if O
they O
ought O
to O
begin O
the O
meeting O
or O
still O
wait. O
At O
last O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
Place O
a O
large O
hired O
landau O
appeared, O
drawn O
by O
two O
thin O
horses, O
which O
a O
coachman O
in O
a O
white O
hat O
was O
whipping O
lustily. O
Binet O
had O
only O
just O
time O
to O
shout, O
"Present O
arms!" O
and O
the O
colonel O
to O
imitate O
him. O
All O
ran O
towards O
the O
enclosure; O
everyone O
pushed O
forward. O
A O
few O
even O
forgot O
their O
collars; O
but O
the O
equipage O
of O
the O
prefect O
seemed O
to O
anticipate O
the O
crowd, O
and O
the O
two O
yoked O
jades, O
trapesing O
in O
their O
harness, O
came O
up O
at O
a O
little O
trot O
in O
front O
of O
the O
peristyle O
of O
the O
town O
hall O
at O
the O
very O
moment O
when O
the O
National O
Guard O
and O
firemen O
deployed, O
beating O
drums O
and O
marking O
time. O
"Present!" O
shouted O
Binet. O
"Halt!" O
shouted O
the O
colonel. O
"Left O
about, O
march." O
And O
after O
presenting O
arms, O
during O
which O
the O
clang O
of O
the O
band, O
letting O
loose, O
rang O
out O
like O
a O
brass O
kettle O
rolling O
downstairs, O
all O
the O
guns O
were O
lowered. O
Then O
was O
seen O
stepping O
down O
from O
the O
carriage O
a O
gentleman O
in O
a O
short O
coat O
with O
silver O
braiding, O
with O
bald O
brow, O
and O
wearing O
a O
tuft O
of O
hair O
at O
the O
back O
of O
his O
head, O
of O
a O
sallow O
complexion O
and O
the O
most O
benign O
appearance. O
His O
eyes, O
very O
large O
and O
covered O
by O
heavy O
lids, O
were O
half-closed O
to O
look O
at O
the O
crowd, O
while O
at O
the O
same O
time O
he O
raised O
his O
sharp O
nose, O
and O
forced O
a O
smile O
upon O
his O
sunken O
mouth. O
He O
recognised O
the O
mayor O
by O
his O
scarf, O
and O
explained O
to O
him O
that O
the O
prefect O
was O
not O
able O
to O
come. O
He O
himself O
was O
a O
councillor O
at O
the O
prefecture; O
then O
he O
added O
a O
few O
apologies. O
Monsieur O
Tuvache O
answered O
them O
with O
compliments; O
the O
other O
confessed O
himself O
nervous; O
and O
they O
remained O
thus, O
face O
to O
face, O
their O
foreheads O
almost O
touching, O
with O
the O
members O
of O
the O
jury O
all O
round, O
the O
municipal O
council, O
the O
notable O
personages, O
the O
National O
Guard O
and O
the O
crowd. O
The O
councillor O
pressing O
his O
little O
cocked O
hat O
to O
his O
breast O
repeated O
his O
bows, O
while O
Tuvache, O
bent O
like O
a O
bow, O
also O
smiled, O
stammered, O
tried O
to O
say O
something, O
protested O
his O
devotion O
to O
the O
monarchy O
and O
the O
honour O
that O
was O
being O
done O
to O
Yonville. O
Hippolyte, O
the O
groom O
from O
the O
inn, O
took O
the O
head O
of O
the O
horses O
from O
the O
coachman, O
and, O
limping O
along O
with O
his O
club-foot, O
led O
them O
to O
the O
door O
of O
the O
"Lion O
d'Or", O
where O
a O
number O
of O
peasants O
collected O
to O
look O
at O
the O
carriage. O
The O
drum O
beat, O
the O
howitzer O
thundered, O
and O
the O
gentlemen O
one O
by O
one O
mounted O
the O
platform, O
where O
they O
sat O
down O
in O
red O
utrecht O
velvet O
arm-chairs O
that O
had O
been O
lent O
by O
Madame O
Tuvache. O
All O
these O
people O
looked O
alike. O
Their O
fair O
flabby O
faces, O
somewhat O
tanned O
by O
the O
sun, O
were O
the O
colour O
of O
sweet O
cider, O
and O
their O
puffy O
whiskers O
emerged O
from O
stiff O
collars, O
kept O
up O
by O
white O
cravats O
with O
broad O
bows. O
All O
the O
waist-coats O
were O
of O
velvet, O
double-breasted; O
all O
the O
watches O
had, O
at O
the O
end O
of O
a O
long O
ribbon, O
an O
oval O
cornelian O
seal; O
everyone O
rested O
his O
two O
hands O
on O
his O
thighs, O
carefully O
stretching O
the O
stride O
of O
their O
trousers, O
whose O
unsponged O
glossy O
cloth O
shone O
more O
brilliantly O
than O
the O
leather O
of O
their O
heavy O
boots. O
The O
ladies O
of O
the O
company O
stood O
at O
the O
back O
under O
the O
vestibule O
between O
the O
pillars O
while O
the O
common O
herd O
was O
opposite, O
standing O
up O
or O
sitting O
on O
chairs. O
As O
a O
matter O
of O
fact, O
Lestiboudois O
had O
brought O
thither O
all O
those O
that O
he O
had O
moved O
from O
the O
field, O
and O
he O
even O
kept O
running O
back O
every O
minute O
to O
fetch O
others O
from O
the O
church. O
He O
caused O
such O
confusion O
with O
this O
piece O
of O
business O
that O
one O
had O
great O
difficulty O
in O
getting O
to O
the O
small O
steps O
of O
the O
platform. O
"I O
think," O
said O
Monsieur O
Lheureux O
to O
the O
chemist, O
who O
was O
passing O
to O
his O
place, O
"that O
they O
ought O
to O
have O
put O
up O
two O
Venetian O
masts O
with O
something O
rather O
severe O
and O
rich O
for O
ornaments; O
it O
would O
have O
been O
a O
very O
pretty O
effect." O
"To O
be O
sure," O
replied O
Homais; O
"but O
what O
can O
you O
expect? O
The O
mayor O
took O
everything O
on O
his O
own O
shoulders. O
He O
hasn't O
much O
taste. O
Poor O
Tuvache! O
and O
he O
is O
even O
completely O
destitute O
of O
what O
is O
called O
the O
genius O
of O
art." O
Rodolphe, O
meanwhile, O
with O
Madame O
Bovary, O
had O
gone O
up O
to O
the O
first O
floor O
of O
the O
town O
hall, O
to O
the O
"council-room," O
and, O
as O
it O
was O
empty, O
he O
declared O
that O
they O
could O
enjoy O
the O
sight O
there O
more O
comfortably. O
He O
fetched O
three O
stools O
from O
the O
round O
table O
under O
the O
bust O
of O
the O
monarch, O
and O
having O
carried O
them O
to O
one O
of O
the O
windows, O
they O
sat O
down O
by O
each O
other. O
There O
was O
commotion O
on O
the O
platform, O
long O
whisperings, O
much O
parleying. O
At O
last O
the O
councillor O
got O
up. O
They O
knew O
now O
that O
his O
name O
was O
Lieuvain, O
and O
in O
the O
crowd O
the O
name O
was O
passed O
from O
one O
to O
the O
other. O
After O
he O
had O
collated O
a O
few O
pages, O
and O
bent O
over O
them O
to O
see O
better, O
he O
began-- O
"Gentlemen! O
May O
I O
be O
permitted O
first O
of O
all O
(before O
addressing O
you O
on O
the O
object O
of O
our O
meeting O
to-day, O
and O
this O
sentiment O
will, O
I O
am O
sure, O
be O
shared O
by O
you O
all), O
may O
I O
be O
permitted, O
I O
say, O
to O
pay O
a O
tribute O
to O
the O
higher O
administration, O
to O
the O
government O
to O
the O
monarch, O
gentle O
men, O
our O
sovereign, O
to O
that O
beloved O
king, O
to O
whom O
no O
branch O
of O
public O
or O
private O
prosperity O
is O
a O
matter O
of O
indifference, O
and O
who O
directs O
with O
a O
hand O
at O
once O
so O
firm O
and O
wise O
the O
chariot O
of O
the O
state O
amid O
the O
incessant O
perils O
of O
a O
stormy O
sea, O
knowing, O
moreover, O
how O
to O
make O
peace O
respected O
as O
well O
as O
war, O
industry, O
commerce, O
agriculture, O
and O
the O
fine O
arts?" O
"I O
ought," O
said O
Rodolphe, O
"to O
get O
back O
a O
little O
further." O
"Why?" O
said O
Emma. O
But O
at O
this O
moment O
the O
voice O
of O
the O
councillor O
rose O
to O
an O
extraordinary O
pitch. O
He O
declaimed-- O
"This O
is O
no O
longer O
the O
time, O
gentlemen, O
when O
civil O
discord O
ensanguined O
our O
public O
places, O
when O
the O
landlord, O
the O
business-man, O
the O
working-man O
himself, O
falling O
asleep O
at O
night, O
lying O
down O
to O
peaceful O
sleep, O
trembled O
lest O
he O
should O
be O
awakened O
suddenly O
by O
the O
noise O
of O
incendiary O
tocsins, O
when O
the O
most O
subversive O
doctrines O
audaciously O
sapped O
foundations." O
"Well, O
someone O
down O
there O
might O
see O
me," O
Rodolphe O
resumed, O
"then O
I O
should O
have O
to O
invent O
excuses O
for O
a O
fortnight; O
and O
with O
my O
bad O
reputation O
-- O
" O
"Oh, O
you O
are O
slandering O
yourself," O
said O
Emma. O
"No! O
It O
is O
dreadful, O
I O
assure O
you." O
"But, O
gentlemen," O
continued O
the O
councillor, O
"if, O
banishing O
from O
my O
memory O
the O
remembrance O
of O
these O
sad O
pictures, O
I O
carry O
my O
eyes O
back O
to O
the O
actual O
situation O
of O
our O
dear O
country, O
what O
do O
I O
see O
there? O
Everywhere O
commerce O
and O
the O
arts O
are O
flourishing; O
everywhere O
new O
means O
of O
communication, O
like O
so O
many O
new O
arteries O
in O
the O
body O
of O
the O
state, O
establish O
within O
it O
new O
relations. O
Our O
great O
industrial O
centres O
have O
recovered O
all O
their O
activity; O
religion, O
more O
consolidated, O
smiles O
in O
all O
hearts; O
our O
ports O
are O
full, O
confidence O
is O
born O
again, O
and O
France O
breathes O
once O
more!" O
"Besides," O
added O
Rodolphe, O
"perhaps O
from O
the O
world's O
point O
of O
view O
they O
are O
right." O
"How O
so?" O
she O
asked. O
"What!" O
said O
he. O
"Do O
you O
not O
know O
that O
there O
are O
souls O
constantly O
tormented? O
They O
need O
by O
turns O
to O
dream O
and O
to O
act, O
the O
purest O
passions O
and O
the O
most O
turbulent O
joys, O
and O
thus O
they O
fling O
themselves O
into O
all O
sorts O
of O
fantasies, O
of O
follies." O
Then O
she O
looked O
at O
him O
as O
one O
looks O
at O
a O
traveller O
who O
has O
voyaged O
over O
strange O
lands, O
and O
went O
on-- O
"We O
have O
not O
even O
this O
distraction, O
we O
poor O
women!" O
"A O
sad O
distraction, O
for O
happiness O
isn't O
found O
in O
it." O
"But O
is O
it O
ever O
found?" O
she O
asked. O
"Yes; O
one O
day O
it O
comes," O
he O
answered. O
"And O
this O
is O
what O
you O
have O
understood," O
said O
the O
councillor. O
"You, O
farmers, O
agricultural O
labourers! O
you O
pacific O
pioneers O
of O
a O
work O
that O
belongs O
wholly O
to O
civilization! O
you, O
men O
of O
progress O
and O
morality, O
you O
have O
understood, O
I O
say, O
that O
political O
storms O
are O
even O
more O
redoubtable O
than O
atmospheric O
disturbances!" O
"It O
comes O
one O
day," O
repeated O
Rodolphe, O
"one O
day O
suddenly, O
and O
when O
one O
is O
despairing O
of O
it. O
Then O
the O
horizon O
expands; O
it O
is O
as O
if O
a O
voice O
cried, O
'It O
is O
here!' O
You O
feel O
the O
need O
of O
confiding O
the O
whole O
of O
your O
life, O
of O
giving O
everything, O
sacrificing O
everything O
to O
this O
being. O
There O
is O
no O
need O
for O
explanations; O
they O
understand O
one O
another. O
They O
have O
seen O
each O
other O
in O
dreams!" O
(And O
he O
looked O
at O
her.) O
"In O
fine, O
here O
it O
is, O
this O
treasure O
so O
sought O
after, O
here O
before O
you. O
It O
glitters, O
it O
flashes; O
yet O
one O
still O
doubts, O
one O
does O
not O
believe O
it; O
one O
remains O
dazzled, O
as O
if O
one O
went O
out O
iron O
darkness O
into O
light." O
And O
as O
he O
ended O
Rodolphe O
suited O
the O
action O
to O
the O
word. O
He O
passed O
his O
hand O
over O
his O
face, O
like O
a O
man O
seized O
with O
giddiness. O
Then O
he O
let O
it O
fall O
on O
Emma's. O
She O
took O
hers O
away. O
"And O
who O
would O
be O
surprised O
at O
it, O
gentlemen? O
He O
only O
who O
is O
so O
blind, O
so O
plunged O
(I O
do O
not O
fear O
to O
say O
it), O
so O
plunged O
in O
the O
prejudices O
of O
another O
age O
as O
still O
to O
misunderstand O
the O
spirit O
of O
agricultural O
populations. O
Where, O
indeed, O
is O
to O
be O
found O
more O
patriotism O
than O
in O
the O
country, O
greater O
devotion O
to O
the O
public O
welfare, O
more O
intelligence, O
in O
a O
word? O
And, O
gentlemen, O
I O
do O
not O
mean O
that O
superficial O
intelligence, O
vain O
ornament O
of O
idle O
minds, O
but O
rather O
that O
profound O
and O
balanced O
intelligence O
that O
applies O
itself O
above O
all O
else O
to O
useful O
objects, O
thus O
contributing O
to O
the O
good O
of O
all, O
to O
the O
common O
amelioration O
and O
to O
the O
support O
of O
the O
state, O
born O
of O
respect O
for O
law O
and O
the O
practice O
of O
duty O
-- O
" O
"Ah! O
again!" O
said O
Rodolphe. O
"Always O
'duty.' O
I O
am O
sick O
of O
the O
word. O
They O
are O
a O
lot O
of O
old O
blockheads O
in O
flannel O
vests O
and O
of O
old O
women O
with O
foot-warmers O
and O
rosaries O
who O
constantly O
drone O
into O
our O
ears O
'Duty, O
duty!' O
Ah! O
by O
Jove! O
one's O
duty O
is O
to O
feel O
what O
is O
great, O
cherish O
the O
beautiful, O
and O
not O
accept O
all O
the O
conventions O
of O
society O
with O
the O
ignominy O
that O
it O
imposes O
upon O
us." O
"Yet-- O
yet O
-- O
" O
objected O
Madame O
Bovary. O
"No, O
no! O
Why O
cry O
out O
against O
the O
passions? O
Are O
they O
not O
the O
one O
beautiful O
thing O
on O
the O
earth, O
the O
source O
of O
heroism, O
of O
enthusiasm, O
of O
poetry, O
music, O
the O
arts, O
of O
everything, O
in O
a O
word?" O
"But O
one O
must," O
said O
Emma, O
"to O
some O
extent O
bow O
to O
the O
opinion O
of O
the O
world O
and O
accept O
its O
moral O
code." O
"Ah! O
but O
there O
are O
two," O
he O
replied. O
"The O
small, O
the O
conventional, O
that O
of O
men, O
that O
which O
constantly O
changes, O
that O
brays O
out O
so O
loudly, O
that O
makes O
such O
a O
commotion O
here O
below, O
of O
the O
earth O
earthly, O
like O
the O
mass O
of O
imbeciles O
you O
see O
down O
there. O
But O
the O
other, O
the O
eternal, O
that O
is O
about O
us O
and O
above, O
like O
the O
landscape O
that O
surrounds O
us, O
and O
the O
blue O
heavens O
that O
give O
us O
light." O
Monsieur O
Lieuvain O
had O
just O
wiped O
his O
mouth O
with O
a O
pocket-handkerchief. O
HE O
CONTINUED-- O
"And O
what O
should O
I O
do O
here O
gentlemen, O
pointing O
out O
to O
you O
the O
uses O
of O
agriculture? O
Who O
supplies O
our O
wants? O
Who O
provides O
our O
means O
of O
subsistence? O
Is O
it O
not O
the O
agriculturist? O
The O
agriculturist, O
gentlemen, O
who, O
sowing O
with O
laborious O
hand O
the O
fertile O
furrows O
of O
the O
country, O
brings O
forth O
the O
corn, O
which, O
being O
ground, O
is O
made O
into O
a O
powder O
by O
means O
of O
ingenious O
machinery, O
comes O
out O
thence O
under O
the O
name O
of O
flour, O
and O
from O
there, O
transported O
to O
our O
cities, O
is O
soon O
delivered O
at O
the O
baker's, O
who O
makes O
it O
into O
food O
for O
poor O
and O
rich O
alike. O
Again, O
is O
it O
not O
the O
agriculturist O
who O
fattens, O
for O
our O
clothes, O
his O
abundant O
flocks O
in O
the O
pastures? O
For O
how O
should O
we O
clothe O
ourselves, O
how O
nourish O
ourselves, O
without O
the O
agriculturist? O
And, O
gentlemen, O
is O
it O
even O
necessary O
to O
go O
so O
far O
for O
examples? O
Who O
has O
not O
frequently O
reflected O
on O
all O
the O
momentous O
things O
that O
we O
get O
out O
of O
that O
modest O
animal, O
the O
ornament O
of O
poultry-yards, O
that O
provides O
us O
at O
once O
with O
a O
soft O
pillow O
for O
our O
bed, O
with O
succulent O
flesh O
for O
our O
tables, O
and O
eggs? O
But O
I O
should O
never O
end O
if O
I O
were O
to O
enumerate O
one O
after O
the O
other O
all O
the O
different O
products O
which O
the O
earth, O
well O
cultivated, O
like O
a O
generous O
mother, O
lavishes O
upon O
her O
children. O
Here O
it O
is O
the O
vine, O
elsewhere O
the O
apple O
tree O
for O
cider, O
there O
colza, O
farther O
on O
cheeses O
and O
flax. O
Gentlemen, O
let O
us O
not O
forget O
flax, O
which O
has O
made O
such O
great O
strides O
of O
late O
years, O
and O
to O
which O
I O
will O
more O
particularly O
call O
your O
attention." O
He O
had O
no O
need O
to O
call O
it, O
for O
all O
the O
mouths O
of O
the O
multitude O
were O
wide O
open, O
as O
if O
to O
drink O
in O
his O
words. O
Tuvache O
by O
his O
side O
listened O
to O
him O
with O
staring O
eyes. O
Monsieur O
Derozerays O
from O
time O
to O
time O
softly O
closed O
his O
eyelids, O
and O
farther O
on O
the O
chemist, O
with O
his O
son O
Napoleon O
between O
his O
knees, O
put O
his O
hand O
behind O
his O
ear O
in O
order O
not O
to O
lose O
a O
syllable. O
The O
chins O
of O
the O
other O
members O
of O
the O
jury O
went O
slowly O
up O
and O
down O
in O
their O
waistcoats O
in O
sign O
of O
approval. O
The O
firemen O
at O
the O
foot O
of O
the O
platform O
rested O
on O
their O
bayonets; O
and O
Binet, O
motionless, O
stood O
with O
out-turned O
elbows, O
the O
point O
of O
his O
sabre O
in O
the O
air. O
Perhaps O
he O
could O
hear, O
but O
certainly O
he O
could O
see O
nothing, O
because O
of O
the O
visor O
of O
his O
helmet, O
that O
fell O
down O
on O
his O
nose. O
His O
lieutenant, O
the O
youngest O
son O
of O
Monsieur O
Tuvache, O
had O
a O
bigger O
one, O
for O
his O
was O
enormous, O
and O
shook O
on O
his O
head, O
and O
from O
it O
an O
end O
of O
his O
cotton O
scarf O
peeped O
out. O
He O
smiled O
beneath O
it O
with O
a O
perfectly O
infantine O
sweetness, O
and O
his O
pale O
little O
face, O
whence O
drops O
were O
running, O
wore O
an O
expression O
of O
enjoyment O
and O
sleepiness. O
The O
square O
as O
far O
as O
the O
houses O
was O
crowded O
with O
people. O
One O
saw O
folk O
leaning O
on O
their O
elbows O
at O
all O
the O
windows, O
others O
standing O
at O
doors, O
and O
Justin, O
in O
front O
of O
the O
chemist's O
shop, O
seemed O
quite O
transfixed O
by O
the O
sight O
of O
what O
he O
was O
looking O
at. O
In O
spite O
of O
the O
silence O
Monsieur O
Lieuvain's O
voice O
was O
lost O
in O
the O
air. O
It O
reached O
you O
in O
fragments O
of O
phrases, O
and O
interrupted O
here O
and O
there O
by O
the O
creaking O
of O
chairs O
in O
the O
crowd; O
then O
you O
suddenly O
heard O
the O
long O
bellowing O
of O
an O
ox, O
or O
else O
the O
bleating O
of O
the O
lambs, O
who O
answered O
one O
another O
at O
street O
corners. O
In O
fact, O
the O
cowherds O
and O
shepherds O
had O
driven O
their O
beasts O
thus O
far, O
and O
these O
lowed O
from O
time O
to O
time, O
while O
with O
their O
tongues O
they O
tore O
down O
some O
scrap O
of O
foliage O
that O
hung O
above O
their O
mouths. O
Rodolphe O
had O
drawn O
nearer O
to O
Emma, O
and O
said O
to O
her O
in O
a O
low O
voice, O
speaking O
rapidly-- O
"Does O
not O
this O
conspiracy O
of O
the O
world O
revolt O
you? O
Is O
there O
a O
single O
sentiment O
it O
does O
not O
condemn? O
The O
noblest O
instincts, O
the O
purest O
sympathies O
are O
persecuted, O
slandered; O
and O
if O
at O
length O
two O
poor O
souls O
do O
meet, O
all O
is O
so O
organised O
that O
they O
cannot O
blend O
together. O
Yet O
they O
will O
make O
the O
attempt; O
they O
will O
flutter O
their O
wings; O
they O
will O
call O
upon O
each O
other. O
Oh! O
no O
matter. O
Sooner O
or O
later, O
in O
six O
months, O
ten O
years, O
they O
will O
come O
together, O
will O
love; O
for O
fate O
has O
decreed O
it, O
and O
they O
are O
born O
one O
for O
the O
other." O
His O
arms O
were O
folded O
across O
his O
knees, O
and O
thus O
lifting O
his O
face O
towards O
Emma, O
close O
by O
her, O
he O
looked O
fixedly O
at O
her. O
She O
noticed O
in O
his O
eyes O
small O
golden O
lines O
radiating O
from O
black O
pupils; O
she O
even O
smelt O
the O
perfume O
of O
the O
pomade O
that O
made O
his O
hair O
glossy. O
Then O
a O
faintness O
came O
over O
her; O
she O
recalled O
the O
Viscount O
who O
had O
waltzed O
with O
her O
at O
Vaubyessard, O
and O
his O
beard O
exhaled O
like O
this O
air O
an O
odour O
of O
vanilla O
and O
citron, O
and O
mechanically O
she O
half-closed O
her O
eyes O
the O
better O
to O
breathe O
it O
in. O
But O
in O
making O
this O
movement, O
as O
she O
leant O
back O
in O
her O
chair, O
she O
saw O
in O
the O
distance, O
right O
on O
the O
line O
of O
the O
horizon, O
the O
old O
diligence, O
the O
"Hirondelle," O
that O
was O
slowly O
descending O
the O
hill O
of O
Leux, O
dragging O
after O
it O
a O
long O
trail O
of O
dust. O
It O
was O
in O
this O
yellow O
carriage O
that O
Leon O
had O
so O
often O
come O
back O
to O
her, O
and O
by O
this O
route O
down O
there O
that O
he O
had O
gone O
for O
ever. O
She O
fancied O
she O
saw O
him O
opposite O
at O
his O
windows; O
then O
all O
grew O
confused; O
clouds O
gathered; O
it O
seemed O
to O
her O
that O
she O
was O
again O
turning O
in O
the O
waltz O
under O
the O
light O
of O
the O
lustres O
on O
the O
arm O
of O
the O
Viscount, O
and O
that O
Leon O
was O
not O
far O
away, O
that O
he O
was O
coming; O
and O
yet O
all O
the O
time O
she O
was O
conscious O
of O
the O
scent O
of O
Rodolphe's O
head O
by O
her O
side. O
This O
sweetness O
of O
sensation O
pierced O
through O
her O
old O
desires, O
and O
these, O
like O
grains O
of O
sand O
under O
a O
gust O
of O
wind, O
eddied O
to O
and O
fro O
in O
the O
subtle O
breath O
of O
the O
perfume O
which O
suffused O
her O
soul. O
She O
opened O
wide O
her O
nostrils O
several O
times O
to O
drink O
in O
the O
freshness O
of O
the O
ivy O
round O
the O
capitals. O
She O
took O
off O
her O
gloves, O
she O
wiped O
her O
hands, O
then O
fanned O
her O
face O
with O
her O
handkerchief, O
while O
athwart O
the O
throbbing O
of O
her O
temples O
she O
heard O
the O
murmur O
of O
the O
crowd O
and O
the O
voice O
of O
the O
councillor O
intoning O
his O
phrases. O
He O
said-- O
"Continue, O
persevere; O
listen O
neither O
to O
the O
suggestions O
of O
routine, O
nor O
to O
the O
over-hasty O
councils O
of O
a O
rash O
empiricism. O
 O
Apply O
yourselves, O
above O
all, O
to O
the O
amelioration O
of O
the O
soil, O
to O
good O
manures, O
to O
the O
development O
of O
the O
equine, O
bovine, O
ovine, O
and O
porcine O
races. O
Let O
these O
shows O
be O
to O
you O
pacific O
arenas, O
where O
the O
victor O
in O
leaving O
it O
will O
hold O
forth O
a O
hand O
to O
the O
vanquished, O
and O
will O
fraternise O
with O
him O
in O
the O
hope O
of O
better O
success. O
And O
you, O
aged O
servants, O
humble O
domestics, O
whose O
hard O
labour O
no O
Government O
up O
to O
this O
day O
has O
taken O
into O
consideration, O
come O
hither O
to O
receive O
the O
reward O
of O
your O
silent O
virtues, O
and O
be O
assured O
that O
the O
state O
henceforward O
has O
its O
eye O
upon O
you; O
that O
it O
encourages O
you, O
protects O
you; O
that O
it O
will O
accede O
to O
your O
just O
demands, O
and O
alleviate O
as O
much O
as O
in O
it O
lies O
the O
burden O
of O
your O
painful O
sacrifices." O
Monsieur O
Lieuvain O
then O
sat O
down; O
Monsieur O
Derozerays O
got O
up, O
beginning O
another O
speech. O
His O
was O
not O
perhaps O
so O
florid O
as O
that O
of O
the O
councillor, O
but O
it O
recommended O
itself O
by O
a O
more O
direct O
style, O
that O
is O
to O
say, O
by O
more O
special O
knowledge O
and O
more O
elevated O
considerations. O
Thus O
the O
praise O
of O
the O
Government O
took O
up O
less O
space O
in O
it; O
religion O
and O
agriculture O
more. O
He O
showed O
in O
it O
the O
relations O
of O
these O
two, O
and O
how O
they O
had O
always O
contributed O
to O
civilisation. O
Rodolphe O
with O
Madame O
Bovary O
was O
talking O
dreams, O
presentiments, O
magnetism. O
Going O
back O
to O
the O
cradle O
of O
society, O
the O
orator O
painted O
those O
fierce O
times O
when O
men O
lived O
on O
acorns O
in O
the O
heart O
of O
woods. O
Then O
they O
had O
left O
off O
the O
skins O
of O
beasts, O
had O
put O
on O
cloth, O
tilled O
the O
soil, O
planted O
the O
vine. O
Was O
this O
a O
good, O
and O
in O
this O
discovery O
was O
there O
not O
more O
of O
injury O
than O
of O
gain? O
Monsieur O
Derozerays O
set O
himself O
this O
problem. O
From O
magnetism O
little O
by O
little O
Rodolphe O
had O
come O
to O
affinities, O
and O
while O
the O
president O
was O
citing O
Cincinnatus O
and O
his O
plough, O
Diocletian, O
planting O
his O
cabbages, O
and O
the O
Emperors O
of O
China O
inaugurating O
the O
year O
by O
the O
sowing O
of O
seed, O
the O
young O
man O
was O
explaining O
to O
the O
young O
woman O
that O
these O
irresistible O
attractions O
find O
their O
cause O
in O
some O
previous O
state O
of O
existence. O
"Thus O
we," O
he O
said, O
"why O
did O
we O
come O
to O
know O
one O
another? O
What O
chance O
willed O
it? O
It O
was O
because O
across O
the O
infinite, O
like O
two O
streams O
that O
flow O
but O
to O
unite; O
our O
special O
bents O
of O
mind O
had O
driven O
us O
towards O
each O
other." O
And O
he O
seized O
her O
hand; O
she O
did O
not O
withdraw O
it. O
"For O
good O
farming O
generally!" O
cried O
the O
president. O
"Just O
now, O
for O
example, O
when O
I O
went O
to O
your O
house." O
"To O
Monsieur O
Bizat O
of O
Quincampoix." O
"Did O
I O
know O
I O
should O
accompany O
you?" O
"Seventy O
francs." O
"A O
hundred O
times O
I O
wished O
to O
go; O
and O
I O
followed O
you O
-- O
I O
remained." O
"Manures!" O
"And O
I O
shall O
remain O
to-night, O
to-morrow, O
all O
other O
days, O
all O
my O
life!" O
"To O
Monsieur O
Caron O
of O
Argueil, O
a O
gold O
medal!" O
"For O
I O
have O
never O
in O
the O
society O
of O
any O
other O
person O
found O
so O
complete O
a O
charm." O
"To O
Monsieur O
Bain O
of O
Givry-Saint-Martin." O
"And O
I O
shall O
carry O
away O
with O
me O
the O
remembrance O
of O
you." O
"For O
a O
merino O
ram!" O
"But O
you O
will O
forget O
me; O
I O
shall O
pass O
away O
like O
a O
shadow." O
"To O
Monsieur O
Belot O
of O
Notre-Dame." O
"Oh, O
no! O
I O
shall O
be O
something O
in O
your O
thought, O
in O
your O
life, O
shall O
I O
not?" O
"Porcine O
race; O
prizes-- O
equal, O
to O
Messrs. O
Leherisse O
and O
Cullembourg, O
sixty O
francs!" O
Rodolphe O
was O
pressing O
her O
hand, O
and O
he O
felt O
it O
all O
warm O
and O
quivering O
like O
a O
captive O
dove O
that O
wants O
to O
fly O
away; O
but, O
whether O
she O
was O
trying O
to O
take O
it O
away O
or O
whether O
she O
was O
answering O
his O
pressure; O
she O
made O
a O
movement O
with O
her O
fingers. O
He O
exclaimed-- O
"Oh, O
I O
thank O
you! O
You O
do O
not O
repulse O
me! O
You O
are O
good! O
You O
understand O
that O
I O
am O
yours! O
Let O
me O
look O
at O
you; O
let O
me O
contemplate O
you!" O
A O
gust O
of O
wind O
that O
blew O
in O
at O
the O
window O
ruffled O
the O
cloth O
on O
the O
table, O
and O
in O
the O
square O
below O
all O
the O
great O
caps O
of O
the O
peasant O
women O
were O
uplifted O
by O
it O
like O
the O
wings O
of O
white O
butterflies O
fluttering. O
"Use O
of O
oil-cakes," O
continued O
the O
president. O
He O
was O
hurrying O
on: O
"Flemish O
manure-flax-growing-drainage-long O
leases-domestic O
service." O
Rodolphe O
was O
no O
longer O
speaking. O
They O
looked O
at O
one O
another. O
A O
supreme O
desire O
made O
their O
dry O
lips O
tremble, O
and O
wearily, O
without O
an O
effort, O
their O
fingers O
intertwined. O
"Catherine O
Nicaise O
Elizabeth O
Leroux, O
of O
Sassetot-la-Guerriere, O
for O
fifty-four O
years O
of O
service O
at O
the O
same O
farm, O
a O
silver O
medal-- O
value, O
twenty-five O
francs!" O
"Where O
is O
Catherine O
Leroux?" O
repeated O
the O
councillor. O
She O
did O
not O
present O
herself, O
and O
one O
could O
hear O
voices O
whispering-- O
"Go O
up!" O
"Don't O
be O
afraid!" O
"Oh, O
how O
stupid O
she O
is!" O
"Well, O
is O
she O
there?" O
cried O
Tuvache. O
"Yes; O
here O
she O
is." O
"Then O
let O
her O
come O
up!" O
Then O
there O
came O
forward O
on O
the O
platform O
a O
little O
old O
woman O
with O
timid O
bearing, O
who O
seemed O
to O
shrink O
within O
her O
poor O
clothes. O
On O
her O
feet O
she O
wore O
heavy O
wooden O
clogs, O
and O
from O
her O
hips O
hung O
a O
large O
blue O
apron. O
Her O
pale O
face O
framed O
in O
a O
borderless O
cap O
was O
more O
wrinkled O
than O
a O
withered O
russet O
apple. O
And O
from O
the O
sleeves O
of O
her O
red O
jacket O
looked O
out O
two O
large O
hands O
with O
knotty O
joints, O
the O
dust O
of O
barns, O
the O
potash O
of O
washing O
the O
grease O
of O
wools O
had O
so O
encrusted, O
roughened, O
hardened O
these O
that O
they O
seemed O
dirty, O
although O
they O
had O
been O
rinsed O
in O
clear O
water; O
and O
by O
dint O
of O
long O
service O
they O
remained O
half O
open, O
as O
if O
to O
bear O
humble O
witness O
for O
themselves O
of O
so O
much O
suffering O
endured. O
Something O
of O
monastic O
rigidity O
dignified O
her O
face. O
Nothing O
of O
sadness O
or O
of O
emotion O
weakened O
that O
pale O
look. O
In O
her O
constant O
living O
with O
animals O
she O
had O
caught O
their O
dumbness O
and O
their O
calm. O
It O
was O
the O
first O
time O
that O
she O
found O
herself O
in O
the O
midst O
of O
so O
large O
a O
company, O
and O
inwardly O
scared O
by O
the O
flags, O
the O
drums, O
the O
gentlemen O
in O
frock-coats, O
and O
the O
order O
of O
the O
councillor, O
she O
stood O
motionless, O
not O
knowing O
whether O
to O
advance O
or O
run O
away, O
nor O
why O
the O
crowd O
was O
pushing O
her O
and O
the O
jury O
were O
smiling O
at O
her. O
Thus O
stood O
before O
these O
radiant O
bourgeois O
this O
half-century O
of O
servitude. O
"Approach, O
venerable O
Catherine O
Nicaise O
Elizabeth O
Leroux!" O
said O
the O
councillor, O
who O
had O
taken O
the O
list O
of O
prize-winners O
from O
the O
president; O
and, O
looking O
at O
the O
piece O
of O
paper O
and O
the O
old O
woman O
by O
turns, O
he O
repeated O
in O
a O
fatherly O
tone-- O
"Approach! O
approach!" O
"Are O
you O
deaf?" O
said O
Tuvache, O
fidgeting O
in O
his O
armchair; O
and O
he O
began O
shouting O
in O
her O
ear, O
"Fifty-four O
years O
of O
service. O
A O
silver O
medal! O
Twenty-five O
francs! O
For O
you!" O
Then, O
when O
she O
had O
her O
medal, O
she O
looked O
at O
it, O
and O
a O
smile O
of O
beatitude O
spread O
over O
her O
face; O
and O
as O
she O
walked O
away O
they O
could O
hear O
her O
muttering O
"I'll O
give O
it O
to O
our O
cure O
up O
home, O
to O
say O
some O
masses O
for O
me!" O
"What O
fanaticism!" O
exclaimed O
the O
chemist, O
leaning O
across O
to O
the O
notary. O
The O
meeting O
was O
over, O
the O
crowd O
dispersed, O
and O
now O
that O
the O
speeches O
had O
been O
read, O
each O
one O
fell O
back O
into O
his O
place O
again, O
and O
everything O
into O
the O
old O
grooves; O
the O
masters O
bullied O
the O
servants, O
and O
these O
struck O
the O
animals, O
indolent O
victors, O
going O
back O
to O
the O
stalls, O
a O
green-crown O
on O
their O
horns. O
The O
National O
Guards, O
however, O
had O
gone O
up O
to O
the O
first O
floor O
of O
the O
town O
hall O
with O
buns O
spitted O
on O
their O
bayonets, O
and O
the O
drummer O
of O
the O
battalion O
carried O
a O
basket O
with O
bottles. O
Madame O
Bovary O
took O
Rodolphe's O
arm; O
he O
saw O
her O
home; O
they O
separated O
at O
her O
door; O
then O
he O
walked O
about O
alone O
in O
the O
meadow O
while O
he O
waited O
for O
the O
time O
of O
the O
banquet. O
The O
feast O
was O
long, O
noisy, O
ill O
served; O
the O
guests O
were O
so O
crowded O
that O
they O
could O
hardly O
move O
their O
elbows; O
and O
the O
narrow O
planks O
used O
for O
forms O
almost O
broke O
down O
under O
their O
weight. O
They O
ate O
hugely. O
Each O
one O
stuffed O
himself O
on O
his O
own O
account. O
Sweat O
stood O
on O
every O
brow, O
and O
a O
whitish O
steam, O
like O
the O
vapour O
of O
a O
stream O
on O
an O
autumn O
morning, O
floated O
above O
the O
table O
between O
the O
hanging O
lamps. O
Rodolphe, O
leaning O
against O
the O
calico O
of O
the O
tent O
was O
thinking O
so O
earnestly O
of O
Emma O
that O
he O
heard O
nothing. O
Behind O
him O
on O
the O
grass O
the O
servants O
were O
piling O
up O
the O
dirty O
plates, O
his O
neighbours O
were O
talking; O
he O
did O
not O
answer O
them; O
they O
filled O
his O
glass, O
and O
there O
was O
silence O
in O
his O
thoughts O
in O
spite O
of O
the O
growing O
noise. O
He O
was O
dreaming O
of O
what O
she O
had O
said, O
of O
the O
line O
of O
her O
lips; O
her O
face, O
as O
in O
a O
magic O
mirror, O
shone O
on O
the O
plates O
of O
the O
shakos, O
the O
folds O
of O
her O
gown O
fell O
along O
the O
walls, O
and O
days O
of O
love O
unrolled O
to O
all O
infinity O
before O
him O
in O
the O
vistas O
of O
the O
future. O
He O
saw O
her O
again O
in O
the O
evening O
during O
the O
fireworks, O
but O
she O
was O
with O
her O
husband, O
Madame O
Homais, O
and O
the O
druggist, O
who O
was O
worrying O
about O
the O
danger O
of O
stray O
rockets, O
and O
every O
moment O
he O
left O
the O
company O
to O
go O
and O
give O
some O
advice O
to O
Binet. O
The O
pyrotechnic O
pieces O
sent O
to O
Monsieur O
Tuvache O
had, O
through O
an O
excess O
of O
caution, O
been O
shut O
up O
in O
his O
cellar, O
and O
so O
the O
damp O
powder O
would O
not O
light, O
and O
the O
principal O
set O
piece, O
that O
was O
to O
represent O
a O
dragon O
biting O
his O
tail, O
failed O
completely. O
Now O
and O
then O
a O
meagre O
Roman-candle O
went O
off; O
then O
the O
gaping O
crowd O
sent O
up O
a O
shout O
that O
mingled O
with O
the O
cry O
of O
the O
women, O
whose O
waists O
were O
being O
squeezed O
in O
the O
darkness. O
Emma O
silently O
nestled O
against O
Charles's O
shoulder; O
then, O
raising O
her O
chin, O
she O
watched O
the O
luminous O
rays O
of O
the O
rockets O
against O
the O
dark O
sky. O
Rodolphe O
gazed O
at O
her O
in O
the O
light O
of O
the O
burning O
lanterns. O
They O
went O
out O
one O
by O
one. O
The O
stars O
shone O
out. O
A O
few O
crops O
of O
rain O
began O
to O
fall. O
She O
knotted O
her O
fichu O
round O
her O
bare O
head. O
At O
this O
moment O
the O
councillor's O
carriage O
came O
out O
from O
the O
inn. O
His O
coachman, O
who O
was O
drunk, O
suddenly O
dozed O
off, O
and O
one O
could O
see O
from O
the O
distance, O
above O
the O
hood, O
between O
the O
two O
lanterns, O
the O
mass O
of O
his O
body, O
that O
swayed O
from O
right O
to O
left O
with O
the O
giving O
of O
the O
traces. O
"Truly," O
said O
the O
druggist, O
"one O
ought O
to O
proceed O
most O
rigorously O
against O
drunkenness! O
I O
should O
like O
to O
see O
written O
up O
weekly O
at O
the O
door O
of O
the O
town O
hall O
on O
a O
board O
ad O
hoc O
the O
names O
of O
all O
those O
who O
during O
the O
week O
got O
intoxicated O
on O
alcohol. O
Besides, O
with O
regard O
to O
statistics, O
one O
would O
thus O
have, O
as O
it O
were, O
public O
records O
that O
one O
could O
refer O
to O
in O
case O
of O
need. O
But O
excuse O
me!" O
SPECIFICALLY O
FOR O
THAT. O
And O
he O
once O
more O
ran O
off O
to O
the O
captain. O
The O
latter O
was O
going O
back O
to O
see O
his O
lathe O
again. O
"Perhaps O
you O
would O
not O
do O
ill," O
Homais O
said O
to O
him, O
"to O
send O
one O
of O
your O
men, O
or O
to O
go O
yourself O
-- O
" O
"Leave O
me O
alone!" O
answered O
the O
tax-collector. O
"It's O
all O
right!" O
"Do O
not O
be O
uneasy," O
said O
the O
druggist, O
when O
he O
returned O
to O
his O
friends. O
"Monsieur O
Binet O
has O
assured O
me O
that O
all O
precautions O
have O
been O
taken. O
No O
sparks O
have O
fallen; O
the O
pumps O
are O
full. O
Let O
us O
go O
to O
rest." O
"Ma O
foi! O
I O
want O
it," O
said O
Madame O
Homais, O
yawning O
at O
large. O
"But O
never O
mind; O
we've O
had O
a O
beautiful O
day O
for O
our O
fete." O
Rodolphe O
repeated O
in O
a O
low O
voice, O
and O
with O
a O
tender O
look, O
"Oh, O
yes! O
very O
beautiful!" O
And O
having O
bowed O
to O
one O
another, O
they O
separated. O
Two O
days O
later, O
in O
the O
"Final O
de O
Rouen," O
there O
was O
a O
long O
article O
on O
the O
show. O
Homais O
had O
composed O
it O
with O
verve O
the O
very O
next O
morning. O
"Why O
these O
festoons, O
these O
flowers, O
these O
garlands? O
Whither O
hurries O
this O
crowd O
like O
the O
waves O
of O
a O
furious O
sea O
under O
the O
torrents O
of O
a O
tropical O
sun O
pouring O
its O
heat O
upon O
our O
heads?" O
Then O
he O
spoke O
of O
the O
condition O
of O
the O
peasants. O
Certainly O
the O
Government O
was O
doing O
much, O
but O
not O
enough. O
"Courage!" O
he O
cried O
to O
it; O
"a O
thousand O
reforms O
are O
indispensable; O
let O
us O
accomplish O
them!" O
Then O
touching O
on O
the O
entry O
of O
the O
councillor, O
he O
did O
not O
forget O
"the O
martial O
air O
of O
our O
militia;" O
nor O
"our O
most O
merry O
village O
maidens;" O
nor O
the O
"bald-headed O
old O
men O
like O
patriarchs O
who O
were O
there, O
and O
of O
whom O
some, O
the O
remnants O
of O
our O
phalanxes, O
still O
felt O
their O
hearts O
beat O
at O
the O
manly O
sound O
of O
the O
drums." O
He O
cited O
himself O
among O
the O
first O
of O
the O
members O
of O
the O
jury, O
and O
he O
even O
called O
attention O
in O
a O
note O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
Monsieur O
Homais, O
chemist, O
had O
sent O
a O
memoir O
on O
cider O
to O
the O
agricultural O
society. O
When O
he O
came O
to O
the O
distribution O
of O
the O
prizes, O
he O
painted O
the O
joy O
of O
the O
prize-winners O
in O
dithyrambic O
strophes. O
"The O
father O
embraced O
the O
son, O
the O
brother O
the O
brother, O
the O
husband O
his O
consort. O
More O
than O
one O
showed O
his O
humble O
medal O
with O
pride; O
and O
no O
doubt O
when O
he O
got O
home O
to O
his O
good O
housewife, O
he O
hung O
it O
up O
weeping O
on O
the O
modest O
walls O
of O
his O
cot. O
 O
About O
six O
o'clock O
a O
banquet O
prepared O
in O
the O
meadow O
of O
Monsieur O
Leigeard O
brought O
together O
the O
principal O
personages O
of O
the O
fete. O
The O
greatest O
cordiality O
reigned O
here. O
Divers O
toasts O
were O
proposed: O
Monsieur O
Lieuvain, O
the O
King; O
Monsieur O
Tuvache, O
the O
Prefect; O
Monsieur O
Derozerays, O
Agriculture; O
Monsieur O
Homais, O
Industry O
and O
the O
Fine O
Arts, O
those O
twin O
sisters; O
Monsieur O
Leplichey, O
Progress. O
In O
the O
evening O
some O
brilliant O
fireworks O
on O
a O
sudden O
illumined O
the O
air. O
One O
would O
have O
called O
it O
a O
veritable O
kaleidoscope, O
a O
real O
operatic O
scene; O
and O
for O
a O
moment O
our O
little O
locality O
might O
have O
thought O
itself O
transported O
into O
the O
midst O
of O
a O
dream O
of O
the O
'Thousand O
and O
One O
Nights.' O
Let O
us O
state O
that O
no O
untoward O
event O
disturbed O
this O
family O
meeting." O
And O
he O
added O
"Only O
the O
absence O
of O
the O
clergy O
was O
remarked. O
No O
doubt O
the O
priests O
understand O
progress O
in O
another O
fashion. O
Just O
as O
you O
please, O
messieurs O
the O
followers O
of O
Loyola!" O
CHAPTER O
NINE O
Six O
weeks O
passed. O
Rodolphe O
did O
not O
come O
again. O
At O
last O
one O
evening O
he O
appeared. O
The O
day O
after O
the O
show O
he O
had O
said O
to O
himself-- O
"We O
mustn't O
go O
back O
too O
soon; O
that O
would O
be O
a O
mistake." O
And O
at O
the O
end O
of O
a O
week O
he O
had O
gone O
off O
hunting. O
After O
the O
hunting O
he O
had O
thought O
it O
was O
too O
late, O
and O
then O
he O
reasoned O
thus-- O
"If O
from O
the O
first O
day O
she O
loved O
me, O
she O
must O
from O
impatience O
to O
see O
me O
again O
love O
me O
more. O
Let's O
go O
on O
with O
it!" O
And O
he O
knew O
that O
his O
calculation O
had O
been O
right O
when, O
on O
entering O
the O
room, O
he O
saw O
Emma O
turn O
pale. O
She O
was O
alone. O
The O
day O
was O
drawing O
in. O
The O
small O
muslin O
curtain O
along O
the O
windows O
deepened O
the O
twilight, O
and O
the O
gilding O
of O
the O
barometer, O
on O
which O
the O
rays O
of O
the O
sun O
fell, O
shone O
in O
the O
looking-glass O
between O
the O
meshes O
of O
the O
coral. O
Rodolphe O
remained O
standing, O
and O
Emma O
hardly O
answered O
his O
first O
conventional O
phrases. O
"I," O
he O
said, O
"have O
been O
busy. O
I O
have O
been O
ill." O
"Seriously?" O
she O
cried. O
"Well," O
said O
Rodolphe, O
sitting O
down O
at O
her O
side O
on O
a O
footstool, O
"no; O
it O
was O
because O
I O
did O
not O
want O
to O
come O
back." O
"Why?" O
"Can O
you O
not O
guess?" O
He O
looked O
at O
her O
again, O
but O
so O
hard O
that O
she O
lowered O
her O
head, O
blushing. O
HE O
WENT O
ON-- O
"Emma!" O
"Sir," O
she O
said, O
drawing O
back O
a O
little. O
"Ah! O
you O
see," O
replied O
he O
in O
a O
melancholy O
voice, O
"that O
I O
was O
right O
not O
to O
come O
back; O
for O
this O
name, O
this O
name O
that O
fills O
my O
whole O
soul, O
and O
that O
escaped O
me, O
you O
forbid O
me O
to O
use! O
Madame O
Bovary! O
why O
all O
the O
world O
calls O
you O
thus! O
Besides, O
it O
is O
not O
your O
name; O
it O
is O
the O
name O
of O
another!" O
He O
repeated, O
"of O
another!" O
And O
he O
hid O
his O
face O
in O
his O
hands. O
"Yes, O
I O
think O
of O
you O
constantly. O
The O
memory O
of O
you O
drives O
me O
to O
despair. O
Ah! O
forgive O
me! O
I O
will O
leave O
you! O
Farewell! O
I O
will O
go O
far O
away, O
so O
far O
that O
you O
will O
never O
hear O
of O
me O
again; O
and O
yet-- O
to-day O
-- O
I O
know O
not O
what O
force O
impelled O
me O
towards O
you. O
For O
one O
does O
not O
struggle O
against O
Heaven; O
one O
cannot O
resist O
the O
smile O
of O
angels; O
one O
is O
carried O
away O
by O
that O
which O
is O
beautiful, O
charming, O
adorable." O
It O
was O
the O
first O
time O
that O
Emma O
had O
heard O
such O
words O
spoken O
to O
herself, O
and O
her O
pride, O
like O
one O
who O
reposes O
bathed O
in O
warmth, O
expanded O
softly O
and O
fully O
at O
this O
glowing O
language. O
"But O
if O
I O
did O
not O
come," O
he O
continued, O
"if O
I O
could O
not O
see O
you, O
at O
least O
I O
have O
gazed O
long O
on O
all O
that O
surrounds O
you. O
At O
night-every O
night-I O
arose; O
I O
came O
hither; O
I O
watched O
your O
house, O
its O
glimmering O
in O
the O
moon, O
the O
trees O
in O
the O
garden O
swaying O
before O
your O
window, O
and O
the O
little O
lamp, O
a O
gleam O
shining O
through O
the O
window-panes O
in O
the O
darkness. O
Ah! O
you O
never O
knew O
that O
there, O
so O
near O
you, O
so O
far O
from O
you, O
was O
a O
poor O
wretch!" O
She O
turned O
towards O
him O
with O
a O
sob. O
"Oh, O
you O
are O
good!" O
she O
said. O
"No, O
I O
love O
you, O
that O
is O
all! O
You O
do O
not O
doubt O
that! O
Tell O
me-- O
one O
word-- O
only O
one O
word!" O
And O
Rodolphe O
imperceptibly O
glided O
from O
the O
footstool O
to O
the O
ground; O
but O
a O
sound O
of O
wooden O
shoes O
was O
heard O
in O
the O
kitchen, O
and O
he O
noticed O
the O
door O
of O
the O
room O
was O
not O
closed. O
"How O
kind O
it O
would O
be O
of O
you," O
he O
went O
on, O
rising, O
"if O
you O
would O
humour O
a O
whim O
of O
mine." O
It O
was O
to O
go O
over O
her O
house; O
he O
wanted O
to O
know O
it; O
and O
Madame O
Bovary O
seeing O
no O
objection O
to O
this, O
they O
both O
rose, O
when O
Charles O
came O
in. O
"Good O
morning, O
doctor," O
Rodolphe O
said O
to O
him. O
The O
doctor, O
flattered O
at O
this O
unexpected O
title, O
launched O
out O
into O
obsequious O
phrases. O
Of O
this O
the O
other O
took O
advantage O
to O
pull O
himself O
together O
a O
little. O
"Madame O
was O
speaking O
to O
me," O
he O
then O
said, O
"about O
her O
health." O
Charles O
interrupted O
him; O
he O
had O
indeed O
a O
thousand O
anxieties; O
his O
wife's O
palpitations O
of O
the O
heart O
were O
beginning O
again. O
Then O
Rodolphe O
asked O
if O
riding O
would O
not O
be O
good. O
"Certainly! O
excellent! O
just O
the O
thing! O
There's O
an O
idea! O
You O
ought O
to O
follow O
it O
up." O
And O
as O
she O
objected O
that O
she O
had O
no O
horse, O
Monsieur O
Rodolphe O
offered O
one. O
She O
refused O
his O
offer; O
he O
did O
not O
insist. O
Then O
to O
explain O
his O
visit O
he O
said O
that O
his O
ploughman, O
the O
man O
of O
the O
blood-letting, O
still O
suffered O
from O
giddiness. O
"I'll O
call O
around," O
said O
Bovary. O
"No, O
no! O
I'll O
send O
him O
to O
you; O
we'll O
come; O
that O
will O
be O
more O
convenient O
for O
you." O
"Ah! O
very O
good! O
I O
thank O
you." O
And O
as O
soon O
as O
they O
were O
alone, O
"Why O
don't O
you O
accept O
Monsieur O
Boulanger's O
kind O
offer?" O
She O
assumed O
a O
sulky O
air, O
invented O
a O
thousand O
excuses, O
and O
finally O
declared O
that O
perhaps O
it O
would O
look O
odd. O
"Well, O
what O
the O
deuce O
do O
I O
care O
for O
that?" O
said O
Charles, O
making O
a O
pirouette. O
"Health O
before O
everything! O
You O
are O
wrong." O
"And O
how O
do O
you O
think O
I O
can O
ride O
when O
I O
haven't O
got O
a O
habit?" O
"You O
must O
order O
one," O
he O
answered. O
The O
riding-habit O
decided O
her. O
When O
the O
habit O
was O
ready, O
Charles O
wrote O
to O
Monsieur O
Boulanger O
that O
his O
wife O
was O
at O
his O
command, O
and O
that O
they O
counted O
on O
his O
good-nature. O
The O
next O
day O
at O
noon O
Rodolphe O
appeared O
at O
Charles's O
door O
with O
two O
saddle-horses. O
One O
had O
pink O
rosettes O
at O
his O
ears O
and O
a O
deerskin O
side-saddle. O
Rodolphe O
had O
put O
on O
high O
soft O
boots, O
saying O
to O
himself O
that O
no O
doubt O
she O
had O
never O
seen O
anything O
like O
them. O
In O
fact, O
Emma O
was O
charmed O
with O
his O
appearance O
as O
he O
stood O
on O
the O
landing O
in O
his O
great O
velvet O
coat O
and O
white O
corduroy O
breeches. O
She O
was O
ready; O
she O
was O
waiting O
for O
him. O
Justin O
escaped O
from O
the O
chemist's O
to O
see O
her O
start, O
and O
the O
chemist O
also O
came O
out. O
He O
was O
giving O
Monsieur O
Boulanger O
a O
little O
good O
advice. O
"An O
accident O
happens O
so O
easily. O
Be O
careful! O
Your O
horses O
perhaps O
are O
mettlesome." O
She O
heard O
a O
noise O
above O
her; O
it O
was O
Felicite O
drumming O
on O
the O
windowpanes O
to O
amuse O
little O
Berthe. O
The O
child O
blew O
her O
a O
kiss; O
her O
mother O
answered O
with O
a O
wave O
of O
her O
whip. O
"A O
pleasant O
ride!" O
cried O
Monsieur O
Homais. O
"Prudence! O
above O
all, O
prudence!" O
And O
he O
flourished O
his O
newspaper O
as O
he O
saw O
them O
disappear. O
As O
soon O
as O
he O
felt O
the O
ground, O
Emma's O
horse O
set O
off O
at O
a O
gallop. O
Rodolphe O
galloped O
by O
her O
side. O
Now O
and O
then O
they O
exchanged O
a O
word. O
Her O
figure O
slightly O
bent, O
her O
hand O
well O
up, O
and O
her O
right O
arm O
stretched O
out, O
she O
gave O
herself O
up O
to O
the O
cadence O
of O
the O
movement O
that O
rocked O
her O
in O
her O
saddle. O
At O
the O
bottom O
of O
the O
hill O
Rodolphe O
gave O
his O
horse O
its O
head; O
they O
started O
together O
at O
a O
bound, O
then O
at O
the O
top O
suddenly O
the O
horses O
stopped, O
and O
her O
large O
blue O
veil O
fell O
about O
her. O
It O
was O
early O
in O
October. O
There O
was O
fog O
over O
the O
land. O
Hazy O
clouds O
hovered O
on O
the O
horizon O
between O
the O
outlines O
of O
the O
hills; O
others, O
rent O
asunder, O
floated O
up O
and O
disappeared. O
Sometimes O
through O
a O
rift O
in O
the O
clouds, O
beneath O
a O
ray O
of O
sunshine, O
gleamed O
from O
afar O
the O
roots O
of O
Yonville, O
with O
the O
gardens O
at O
the O
water's O
edge, O
the O
yards, O
the O
walls O
and O
the O
church O
steeple. O
Emma O
half O
closed O
her O
eyes O
to O
pick O
out O
her O
house, O
and O
never O
had O
this O
poor O
village O
where O
she O
lived O
appeared O
so O
small. O
From O
the O
height O
on O
which O
they O
were O
the O
whole O
valley O
seemed O
an O
immense O
pale O
lake O
sending O
off O
its O
vapour O
into O
the O
air. O
Clumps O
of O
trees O
here O
and O
there O
stood O
out O
like O
black O
rocks, O
and O
the O
tall O
lines O
of O
the O
poplars O
that O
rose O
above O
the O
mist O
were O
like O
a O
beach O
stirred O
by O
the O
wind. O
By O
the O
side, O
on O
the O
turf O
between O
the O
pines, O
a O
brown O
light O
shimmered O
in O
the O
warm O
atmosphere. O
The O
earth, O
ruddy O
like O
the O
powder O
of O
tobacco, O
deadened O
the O
noise O
of O
their O
steps, O
and O
with O
the O
edge O
of O
their O
shoes O
the O
horses O
as O
they O
walked O
kicked O
the O
fallen O
fir O
cones O
in O
front O
of O
them. O
Rodolphe O
and O
Emma O
thus O
went O
along O
the O
skirt O
of O
the O
wood. O
She O
turned O
away O
from O
time O
to O
time O
to O
avoid O
his O
look, O
and O
then O
she O
saw O
only O
the O
pine O
trunks O
in O
lines, O
whose O
monotonous O
succession O
made O
her O
a O
little O
giddy. O
The O
horses O
were O
panting; O
the O
leather O
of O
the O
saddles O
creaked. O
Just O
as O
they O
were O
entering O
the O
forest O
the O
sun O
shone O
out. O
"God O
protects O
us!" O
said O
Rodolphe. O
"Do O
you O
think O
so?" O
she O
said. O
"Forward! O
forward!" O
he O
continued. O
He O
"tchk'd" O
with O
his O
tongue. O
The O
two O
beasts O
set O
off O
at O
a O
trot. O
Long O
ferns O
by O
the O
roadside O
caught O
in O
Emma's O
stirrup. O
Rodolphe O
leant O
forward O
and O
removed O
them O
as O
they O
rode O
along. O
At O
other O
times, O
to O
turn O
aside O
the O
branches, O
he O
passed O
close O
to O
her, O
and O
Emma O
felt O
his O
knee O
brushing O
against O
her O
leg. O
The O
sky O
was O
now O
blue, O
the O
leaves O
no O
longer O
stirred. O
There O
were O
spaces O
full O
of O
heather O
in O
flower, O
and O
plots O
of O
violets O
alternated O
with O
the O
confused O
patches O
of O
the O
trees O
that O
were O
grey, O
fawn, O
or O
golden O
coloured, O
according O
to O
the O
nature O
of O
their O
leaves. O
Often O
in O
the O
thicket O
was O
heard O
the O
fluttering O
of O
wings, O
or O
else O
the O
hoarse, O
soft O
cry O
of O
the O
ravens O
flying O
off O
amidst O
the O
oaks. O
They O
dismounted. O
Rodolphe O
fastened O
up O
the O
horses. O
She O
walked O
on O
in O
front O
on O
the O
moss O
between O
the O
paths. O
But O
her O
long O
habit O
got O
in O
her O
way, O
although O
she O
held O
it O
up O
by O
the O
skirt; O
and O
Rodolphe, O
walking O
behind O
her, O
saw O
between O
the O
black O
cloth O
and O
the O
black O
shoe O
the O
fineness O
of O
her O
white O
stocking, O
that O
seemed O
to O
him O
as O
if O
it O
were O
a O
part O
of O
her O
nakedness. O
She O
stopped. O
"I O
am O
tired," O
she O
said. O
"Come, O
try O
again," O
he O
went O
on. O
"Courage!" O
Then O
some O
hundred O
paces O
farther O
on O
she O
again O
stopped, O
and O
through O
her O
veil, O
that O
fell O
sideways O
from O
her O
man's O
hat O
over O
her O
hips, O
her O
face O
appeared O
in O
a O
bluish O
transparency O
as O
if O
she O
were O
floating O
under O
azure O
waves. O
"But O
where O
are O
we O
going?" O
He O
did O
not O
answer. O
She O
was O
breathing O
irregularly. O
Rodolphe O
looked O
round O
him O
biting O
his O
moustache. O
They O
came O
to O
a O
larger O
space O
where O
the O
coppice O
had O
been O
cut. O
They O
sat O
down O
on O
the O
trunk O
of O
a O
fallen O
tree, O
and O
Rodolphe O
began O
speaking O
to O
her O
of O
his O
love. O
He O
did O
not O
begin O
by O
frightening O
her O
with O
compliments. O
He O
was O
calm, O
serious, O
melancholy. O
Emma O
listened O
to O
him O
with O
bowed O
head, O
and O
stirred O
the O
bits O
of O
wood O
on O
the O
ground O
with O
the O
tip O
of O
her O
foot. O
But O
at O
the O
words, O
"Are O
not O
our O
destinies O
now O
one?" O
"Oh, O
no!" O
she O
replied. O
"You O
know O
that O
well. O
It O
is O
impossible!" O
She O
rose O
to O
go. O
He O
seized O
her O
by O
the O
wrist. O
She O
stopped. O
Then, O
having O
gazed O
at O
him O
for O
a O
few O
moments O
with O
an O
amorous O
and O
humid O
look, O
she O
said O
hurriedly-- O
"Ah! O
do O
not O
speak O
of O
it O
again! O
Where O
are O
the O
horses? O
Let O
us O
go O
back." O
He O
made O
a O
gesture O
of O
anger O
and O
annoyance. O
She O
repeated: O
"Where O
are O
the O
horses? O
Where O
are O
the O
horses?" O
Then O
smiling O
a O
strange O
smile, O
his O
pupil O
fixed, O
his O
teeth O
set, O
he O
advanced O
with O
outstretched O
arms. O
She O
recoiled O
trembling. O
She O
stammered: O
"Oh, O
you O
frighten O
me! O
You O
hurt O
me! O
Let O
me O
go!" O
"If O
it O
must O
be," O
he O
went O
on, O
his O
face O
changing; O
and O
he O
again O
became O
respectful, O
caressing, O
timid. O
She O
gave O
him O
her O
arm. O
They O
went O
back. O
He O
said-- O
"What O
was O
the O
matter O
with O
you? O
Why? O
I O
do O
not O
understand. O
You O
were O
mistaken, O
no O
doubt. O
In O
my O
soul O
you O
are O
as O
a O
Madonna O
on O
a O
pedestal, O
in O
a O
place O
lofty, O
secure, O
immaculate. O
But O
I O
need O
you O
to O
live! O
I O
must O
have O
your O
eyes, O
your O
voice, O
your O
thought! O
Be O
my O
friend, O
my O
sister, O
my O
angel!" O
And O
he O
put O
out O
his O
arm O
round O
her O
waist. O
She O
feebly O
tried O
to O
disengage O
herself. O
He O
supported O
her O
thus O
as O
they O
walked O
along. O
But O
they O
heard O
the O
two O
horses O
browsing O
on O
the O
leaves. O
"Oh! O
one O
moment!" O
said O
Rodolphe. O
"Do O
not O
let O
us O
go! O
Stay!" O
He O
drew O
her O
farther O
on O
to O
a O
small O
pool O
where O
duckweeds O
made O
a O
greenness O
on O
the O
water. O
Faded O
water O
lilies O
lay O
motionless O
between O
the O
reeds. O
At O
the O
noise O
of O
their O
steps O
in O
the O
grass, O
frogs O
jumped O
away O
to O
hide O
themselves. O
"I O
am O
wrong! O
I O
am O
wrong!" O
she O
said. O
"I O
am O
mad O
to O
listen O
to O
you!" O
"Why? O
Emma! O
Emma!" O
"Oh, O
Rodolphe!" O
said O
the O
young O
woman O
slowly, O
leaning O
on O
his O
shoulder. O
The O
cloth O
of O
her O
habit O
caught O
against O
the O
velvet O
of O
his O
coat. O
She O
threw O
back O
her O
white O
neck, O
swelling O
with O
a O
sigh, O
and O
faltering, O
in O
tears, O
with O
a O
long O
shudder O
and O
hiding O
her O
face, O
she O
gave O
herself O
up O
to O
him-- O
The O
shades O
of O
night O
were O
falling; O
the O
horizontal O
sun O
passing O
between O
the O
branches O
dazzled O
the O
eyes. O
Here O
and O
there O
around O
her, O
in O
the O
leaves O
or O
on O
the O
ground, O
trembled O
luminous O
patches, O
as O
it O
hummingbirds O
flying O
about O
had O
scattered O
their O
feathers. O
Silence O
was O
everywhere; O
something O
sweet O
seemed O
to O
come O
forth O
from O
the O
trees; O
she O
felt O
her O
heart, O
whose O
beating O
had O
begun O
again, O
and O
the O
blood O
coursing O
through O
her O
flesh O
like O
a O
stream O
of O
milk. O
Then O
far O
away, O
beyond O
the O
wood, O
on O
the O
other O
hills, O
she O
heard O
a O
vague O
prolonged O
cry, O
a O
voice O
which O
lingered, O
and O
in O
silence O
she O
heard O
it O
mingling O
like O
music O
with O
the O
last O
pulsations O
of O
her O
throbbing O
nerves. O
Rodolphe, O
a O
cigar O
between O
his O
lips, O
was O
mending O
with O
his O
penknife O
one O
of O
the O
two O
broken O
bridles. O
They O
returned O
to O
Yonville O
by O
the O
same O
road. O
On O
the O
mud O
they O
saw O
again O
the O
traces O
of O
their O
horses O
side O
by O
side, O
the O
same O
thickets, O
the O
same O
stones O
to O
the O
grass; O
nothing O
around O
them O
seemed O
changed; O
and O
yet O
for O
her O
something O
had O
happened O
more O
stupendous O
than O
if O
the O
mountains O
had O
moved O
in O
their O
places. O
Rodolphe O
now O
and O
again O
bent O
forward O
and O
took O
her O
hand O
to O
kiss O
it. O
She O
was O
charming O
on O
horseback-- O
upright, O
with O
her O
slender O
waist, O
her O
knee O
bent O
on O
the O
mane O
of O
her O
horse, O
her O
face O
somewhat O
flushed O
by O
the O
fresh O
air O
in O
the O
red O
of O
the O
evening. O
On O
entering O
Yonville O
she O
made O
her O
horse O
prance O
in O
the O
road. O
People O
looked O
at O
her O
from O
the O
windows. O
At O
dinner O
her O
husband O
thought O
she O
looked O
well, O
but O
she O
pretended O
not O
to O
hear O
him O
when O
he O
inquired O
about O
her O
ride, O
and O
she O
remained O
sitting O
there O
with O
her O
elbow O
at O
the O
side O
of O
her O
plate O
between O
the O
two O
lighted O
candles. O
"Emma!" O
he O
said. O
"What?" O
"Well, O
I O
spent O
the O
afternoon O
at O
Monsieur O
Alexandre's. O
He O
has O
an O
old O
cob, O
still O
very O
fine, O
only O
a O
little O
broken-kneed, O
and O
that O
could O
be O
bought; O
I O
am O
sure, O
for O
a O
hundred O
crowns." O
He O
added, O
"And O
thinking O
it O
might O
please O
you, O
I O
have O
bespoken O
it-- O
bought O
it. O
Have O
I O
done O
right? O
Do O
tell O
me?" O
She O
nodded O
her O
head O
in O
assent; O
then O
a O
quarter O
of O
an O
hour O
later-- O
"Are O
you O
going O
out O
to-night?" O
she O
asked. O
"Yes. O
Why?" O
"Oh, O
nothing, O
nothing, O
my O
dear!" O
And O
as O
soon O
as O
she O
had O
got O
rid O
of O
Charles O
she O
went O
and O
shut O
herself O
up O
in O
her O
room. O
At O
first O
she O
felt O
stunned; O
she O
saw O
the O
trees, O
the O
paths, O
the O
ditches, O
Rodolphe, O
and O
she O
again O
felt O
the O
pressure O
of O
his O
arm, O
while O
the O
leaves O
rustled O
and O
the O
reeds O
whistled. O
But O
when O
she O
saw O
herself O
in O
the O
glass O
she O
wondered O
at O
her O
face. O
Never O
had O
her O
eyes O
been O
so O
large, O
so O
black, O
of O
so O
profound O
a O
depth. O
Something O
subtle O
about O
her O
being O
transfigured O
her. O
She O
repeated, O
"I O
have O
a O
lover! O
a O
lover!" O
delighting O
at O
the O
idea O
as O
if O
a O
second O
puberty O
had O
come O
to O
her. O
So O
at O
last O
she O
was O
to O
know O
those O
joys O
of O
love, O
that O
fever O
of O
happiness O
of O
which O
she O
had O
despaired! O
She O
was O
entering O
upon O
marvels O
where O
all O
would O
be O
passion, O
ecstasy, O
delirium. O
An O
azure O
infinity O
encompassed O
her, O
the O
heights O
of O
sentiment O
sparkled O
under O
her O
thought, O
and O
ordinary O
existence O
appeared O
only O
afar O
off, O
down O
below O
in O
the O
shade, O
through O
the O
interspaces O
of O
these O
heights. O
Then O
she O
recalled O
the O
heroines O
of O
the O
books O
that O
she O
had O
read, O
and O
the O
lyric O
legion O
of O
these O
adulterous O
women O
began O
to O
sing O
in O
her O
memory O
with O
the O
voice O
of O
sisters O
that O
charmed O
her. O
She O
became O
herself, O
as O
it O
were, O
an O
actual O
part O
of O
these O
imaginings, O
and O
realised O
the O
love-dream O
of O
her O
youth O
as O
she O
saw O
herself O
in O
this O
type O
of O
amorous O
women O
whom O
she O
had O
so O
envied. O
Besides, O
Emma O
felt O
a O
satisfaction O
of O
revenge. O
Had O
she O
not O
suffered O
enough? O
But O
now O
she O
triumphed, O
and O
the O
love O
so O
long O
pent O
up O
burst O
forth O
in O
full O
joyous O
bubblings. O
She O
tasted O
it O
without O
remorse, O
without O
anxiety, O
without O
trouble. O
The O
day O
following O
passed O
with O
a O
new O
sweetness. O
They O
made O
vows O
to O
one O
another O
She O
told O
him O
of O
her O
sorrows. O
Rodolphe O
interrupted O
her O
with O
kisses; O
and O
she O
looking O
at O
him O
through O
half-closed O
eyes, O
asked O
him O
to O
call O
her O
again O
by O
her O
name-- O
to O
say O
that O
he O
loved O
her O
They O
were O
in O
the O
forest, O
as O
yesterday, O
in O
the O
shed O
of O
some O
woodenshoe O
maker. O
The O
walls O
were O
of O
straw, O
and O
the O
roof O
so O
low O
they O
had O
to O
stoop. O
They O
were O
seated O
side O
by O
side O
on O
a O
bed O
of O
dry O
leaves. O
From O
that O
day O
forth O
they O
wrote O
to O
one O
another O
regularly O
every O
evening. O
Emma O
placed O
her O
letter O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
garden, O
by O
the O
river, O
in O
a O
fissure O
of O
the O
wall. O
Rodolphe O
came O
to O
fetch O
it, O
and O
put O
another O
there, O
that O
she O
always O
found O
fault O
with O
as O
too O
short. O
One O
morning, O
when O
Charles O
had O
gone O
out O
before O
day O
break, O
she O
was O
seized O
with O
the O
fancy O
to O
see O
Rodolphe O
at O
once. O
She O
would O
go O
quickly O
to O
La O
Huchette, O
stay O
there O
an O
hour, O
and O
be O
back O
again O
at O
Yonville O
while O
everyone O
was O
still O
asleep. O
This O
idea O
made O
her O
pant O
with O
desire, O
and O
she O
soon O
found O
herself O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
field, O
walking O
with O
rapid O
steps, O
without O
looking O
behind O
her. O
Day O
was O
just O
breaking. O
Emma O
from O
afar O
recognised O
her O
lover's O
house. O
Its O
two O
dove-tailed O
weathercocks O
stood O
out O
black O
against O
the O
pale O
dawn. O
Beyond O
the O
farmyard O
there O
was O
a O
detached O
building O
that O
she O
thought O
must O
be O
the O
chateau O
She O
entered-- O
it O
was O
if O
the O
doors O
at O
her O
approach O
had O
opened O
wide O
of O
their O
own O
accord. O
A O
large O
straight O
staircase O
led O
up O
to O
the O
corridor. O
Emma O
raised O
the O
latch O
of O
a O
door, O
and O
suddenly O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
room O
she O
saw O
a O
man O
sleeping. O
It O
was O
Rodolphe. O
She O
uttered O
a O
cry. O
"You O
here? O
You O
here?" O
he O
repeated. O
"How O
did O
you O
manage O
to O
come? O
Ah! O
your O
dress O
is O
damp." O
"I O
love O
you," O
she O
answered, O
throwing O
her O
arms O
about O
his O
neck. O
This O
first O
piece O
of O
daring O
successful, O
now O
every O
time O
Charles O
went O
out O
early O
Emma O
dressed O
quickly O
and O
slipped O
on O
tiptoe O
down O
the O
steps O
that O
led O
to O
the O
waterside. O
But O
when O
the O
plank O
for O
the O
cows O
was O
taken O
up, O
she O
had O
to O
go O
by O
the O
walls O
alongside O
of O
the O
river; O
the O
bank O
was O
slippery; O
in O
order O
not O
to O
fall O
she O
caught O
hold O
of O
the O
tufts O
of O
faded O
wallflowers. O
Then O
she O
went O
across O
ploughed O
fields, O
in O
which O
she O
sank, O
stumbling; O
and O
clogging O
her O
thin O
shoes. O
Her O
scarf, O
knotted O
round O
her O
head, O
fluttered O
to O
the O
wind O
in O
the O
meadows. O
She O
was O
afraid O
of O
the O
oxen; O
she O
began O
to O
run; O
she O
arrived O
out O
of O
breath, O
with O
rosy O
cheeks, O
and O
breathing O
out O
from O
her O
whole O
person O
a O
fresh O
perfume O
of O
sap, O
of O
verdure, O
of O
the O
open O
air. O
At O
this O
hour O
Rodolphe O
still O
slept. O
It O
was O
like O
a O
spring O
morning O
coming O
into O
his O
room. O
The O
yellow O
curtains O
along O
the O
windows O
let O
a O
heavy, O
whitish O
light O
enter O
softly. O
Emma O
felt O
about, O
opening O
and O
closing O
her O
eyes, O
while O
the O
drops O
of O
dew O
hanging O
from O
her O
hair O
formed, O
as O
it O
were, O
a O
topaz O
aureole O
around O
her O
face. O
Rodolphe, O
laughing, O
drew O
her O
to O
him, O
and O
pressed O
her O
to O
his O
breast. O
Then O
she O
examined O
the O
apartment, O
opened O
the O
drawers O
of O
the O
tables, O
combed O
her O
hair O
with O
his O
comb, O
and O
looked O
at O
herself O
in O
his O
shaving-glass. O
Often O
she O
even O
put O
between O
her O
teeth O
the O
big O
pipe O
that O
lay O
on O
the O
table O
by O
the O
bed, O
amongst O
lemons O
and O
pieces O
of O
sugar O
near O
a O
bottle O
of O
water. O
It O
took O
them O
a O
good O
quarter O
of O
an O
hour O
to O
say O
goodbye. O
Then O
Emma O
cried. O
She O
would O
have O
wished O
never O
to O
leave O
Rodolphe. O
Something O
stronger O
than O
herself O
forced O
her O
to O
him; O
so O
much O
so, O
that O
one O
day, O
seeing O
her O
come O
unexpectedly, O
he O
frowned O
as O
one O
put O
out. O
"What O
is O
the O
matter O
with O
you?" O
she O
said. O
"Are O
you O
ill? O
Tell O
me!" O
At O
last O
he O
declared O
with O
a O
serious O
air O
that O
her O
visits O
were O
becoming O
imprudent-- O
that O
she O
was O
compromising O
herself. O
CHAPTER O
TEN O
Gradually O
Rodolphe's O
fears O
took O
possession O
of O
her. O
At O
first, O
love O
had O
intoxicated O
her; O
and O
she O
had O
thought O
of O
nothing O
beyond. O
But O
now O
that O
he O
was O
indispensable O
to O
her O
life, O
she O
feared O
to O
lose O
anything O
of O
this, O
or O
even O
that O
it O
should O
be O
disturbed. O
When O
she O
came O
back O
from O
his O
house O
she O
looked O
all O
about O
her, O
anxiously O
watching O
every O
form O
that O
passed O
in O
the O
horizon, O
and O
every O
village O
window O
from O
which O
she O
could O
be O
seen. O
She O
listened O
for O
steps, O
cries, O
the O
noise O
of O
the O
ploughs, O
and O
she O
stopped O
short, O
white, O
and O
trembling O
more O
than O
the O
aspen O
leaves O
swaying O
overhead. O
One O
morning O
as O
she O
was O
thus O
returning, O
she O
suddenly O
thought O
she O
saw O
the O
long O
barrel O
of O
a O
carbine O
that O
seemed O
to O
be O
aimed O
at O
her. O
It O
stuck O
out O
sideways O
from O
the O
end O
of O
a O
small O
tub O
half-buried O
in O
the O
grass O
on O
the O
edge O
of O
a O
ditch. O
Emma, O
half-fainting O
with O
terror, O
nevertheless O
walked O
on, O
and O
a O
man O
stepped O
out O
of O
the O
tub O
like O
a O
Jack-in-the-box. O
He O
had O
gaiters O
buckled O
up O
to O
the O
knees, O
his O
cap O
pulled O
down O
over O
his O
eyes, O
trembling O
lips, O
and O
a O
red O
nose. O
It O
was O
Captain O
Binet O
lying O
in O
ambush O
for O
wild O
ducks. O
"You O
ought O
to O
have O
called O
out O
long O
ago!" O
he O
exclaimed; O
"When O
one O
sees O
a O
gun, O
one O
should O
always O
give O
warning." O
The O
tax-collector O
was O
thus O
trying O
to O
hide O
the O
fright O
he O
had O
had, O
for O
a O
prefectorial O
order O
having O
prohibited O
duckhunting O
except O
in O
boats, O
Monsieur O
Binet, O
despite O
his O
respect O
for O
the O
laws, O
was O
infringing O
them, O
and O
so O
he O
every O
moment O
expected O
to O
see O
the O
rural O
guard O
turn O
up. O
But O
this O
anxiety O
whetted O
his O
pleasure, O
and, O
all O
alone O
in O
his O
tub, O
he O
congratulated O
himself O
on O
his O
luck O
and O
on O
his O
cuteness. O
At O
sight O
of O
Emma O
he O
seemed O
relieved O
from O
a O
great O
weight, O
and O
at O
once O
entered O
upon O
a O
conversation. O
"It O
isn't O
warm; O
it's O
nipping." O
Emma O
answered O
nothing. O
He O
went O
on-- O
"And O
you're O
out O
so O
early?" O
"Yes," O
she O
said O
stammering; O
"I O
am O
just O
coming O
from O
the O
nurse O
where O
my O
child O
is." O
"Ah! O
very O
good! O
very O
good! O
For O
myself, O
I O
am O
here, O
just O
as O
you O
see O
me, O
since O
break O
of O
day; O
but O
the O
weather O
is O
so O
muggy, O
that O
unless O
one O
had O
the O
bird O
at O
the O
mouth O
of O
the O
gun O
-- O
" O
"Good O
evening, O
Monsieur O
Binet," O
she O
interrupted O
him, O
turning O
on O
her O
heel. O
"Your O
servant, O
madame," O
he O
replied O
drily; O
and O
he O
went O
back O
into O
his O
tub. O
Emma O
regretted O
having O
left O
the O
tax-collector O
so O
abruptly. O
No O
doubt O
he O
would O
form O
unfavourable O
conjectures. O
The O
story O
about O
the O
nurse O
was O
the O
worst O
possible O
excuse, O
everyone O
at O
Yonville O
knowing O
that O
the O
little O
Bovary O
had O
been O
at O
home O
with O
her O
parents O
for O
a O
year. O
Besides, O
no O
one O
was O
living O
in O
this O
direction; O
this O
path O
led O
only O
to O
La O
Huchette. O
Binet, O
then, O
would O
guess O
whence O
she O
came, O
and O
he O
would O
not O
keep O
silence; O
he O
would O
talk, O
that O
was O
certain. O
She O
remained O
until O
evening O
racking O
her O
brain O
with O
every O
conceivable O
lying O
project, O
and O
had O
constantly O
before O
her O
eyes O
that O
imbecile O
with O
the O
game-bag. O
Charles O
after O
dinner, O
seeing O
her O
gloomy, O
proposed, O
by O
way O
of O
distraction, O
to O
take O
her O
to O
the O
chemist's, O
and O
the O
first O
person O
she O
caught O
sight O
of O
in O
the O
shop O
was O
the O
taxcollector O
again. O
He O
was O
standing O
in O
front O
of O
the O
counter, O
lit O
up O
by O
the O
gleams O
of O
the O
red O
bottle, O
and O
was O
saying-- O
"Please O
give O
me O
half O
an O
ounce O
of O
vitriol." O
"Justin," O
cried O
the O
druggist, O
"bring O
us O
the O
sulphuric O
acid." O
Then O
to O
Emma, O
who O
was O
going O
up O
to O
Madame O
Homais' O
room, O
"No, O
stay O
here; O
it O
isn't O
worth O
while O
going O
up; O
she O
is O
just O
coming O
down. O
Warm O
yourself O
at O
the O
stove O
in O
the O
meantime. O
Excuse O
me. O
Good-day, O
doctor," O
(for O
the O
chemist O
much O
enjoyed O
pronouncing O
the O
word O
"doctor," O
as O
if O
addressing O
another O
by O
it O
reflected O
on O
himself O
some O
of O
the O
grandeur O
that O
he O
found O
in O
it). O
"Now, O
take O
care O
not O
to O
upset O
the O
mortars! O
You'd O
better O
fetch O
some O
chairs O
from O
the O
little O
room; O
you O
know O
very O
well O
that O
the O
arm-chairs O
are O
not O
to O
be O
taken O
out O
of O
the O
drawing-room." O
And O
to O
put O
his O
arm-chair O
back O
in O
its O
place O
he O
was O
darting O
away O
from O
the O
counter, O
when O
Binet O
asked O
him O
for O
half O
an O
ounce O
of O
sugar O
acid. O
"Sugar O
acid!" O
said O
the O
chemist O
contemptuously, O
"don't O
know O
it; O
I'm O
ignorant O
of O
it! O
But O
perhaps O
you O
want O
oxalic O
acid. O
It O
is O
oxalic O
acid, O
isn't O
it?" O
Binet O
explained O
that O
he O
wanted O
a O
corrosive O
to O
make O
himself O
some O
copperwater O
with O
which O
to O
remove O
rust O
from O
his O
hunting O
things. O
Emma O
shuddered. O
The O
chemist O
began O
saying-- O
"Indeed O
the O
weather O
is O
not O
propitious O
on O
account O
of O
the O
damp." O
"Nevertheless," O
replied O
the O
tax-collector, O
with O
a O
sly O
look, O
"there O
are O
people O
who O
like O
it." O
She O
was O
stifling. O
"And O
give O
me O
-- O
" O
"Will O
he O
never O
go?" O
thought O
she. O
"Half O
an O
ounce O
of O
resin O
and O
turpentine, O
four O
ounces O
of O
yellow O
wax, O
and O
three O
half O
ounces O
of O
animal O
charcoal, O
if O
you O
please, O
to O
clean O
the O
varnished O
leather O
of O
my O
togs." O
The O
druggist O
was O
beginning O
to O
cut O
the O
wax O
when O
Madame O
Homais O
appeared, O
Irma O
in O
her O
arms, O
Napoleon O
by O
her O
side, O
and O
Athalie O
following. O
She O
sat O
down O
on O
the O
velvet O
seat O
by O
the O
window, O
and O
the O
lad O
squatted O
down O
on O
a O
footstool, O
while O
his O
eldest O
sister O
hovered O
round O
the O
jujube O
box O
near O
her O
papa. O
The O
latter O
was O
filling O
funnels O
and O
corking O
phials, O
sticking O
on O
labels, O
making O
up O
parcels. O
Around O
him O
all O
were O
silent; O
only O
from O
time O
to O
time, O
were O
heard O
the O
weights O
jingling O
in O
the O
balance, O
and O
a O
few O
low O
words O
from O
the O
chemist O
giving O
directions O
to O
his O
pupil. O
"And O
how's O
the O
little O
woman?" O
suddenly O
asked O
Madame O
Homais. O
"Silence!" O
exclaimed O
her O
husband, O
who O
was O
writing O
down O
some O
figures O
in O
his O
waste-book. O
"Why O
didn't O
you O
bring O
her?" O
she O
went O
on O
in O
a O
low O
voice. O
"Hush! O
hush!" O
said O
Emma, O
pointing O
with O
her O
finger O
to O
the O
druggist. O
But O
Binet, O
quite O
absorbed O
in O
looking O
over O
his O
bill, O
had O
probably O
heard O
nothing. O
At O
last O
he O
went O
out. O
Then O
Emma, O
relieved, O
uttered O
a O
deep O
sigh. O
"How O
hard O
you O
are O
breathing!" O
said O
Madame O
Homais. O
"Well, O
you O
see, O
it's O
rather O
warm," O
she O
replied. O
So O
the O
next O
day O
they O
talked O
over O
how O
to O
arrange O
their O
rendezvous. O
Emma O
wanted O
to O
bribe O
her O
servant O
with O
a O
present, O
but O
it O
would O
be O
better O
to O
find O
some O
safe O
house O
at O
Yonville. O
Rodolphe O
promised O
to O
look O
for O
one. O
All O
through O
the O
winter, O
three O
or O
four O
times O
a O
week, O
in O
the O
dead O
of O
night O
he O
came O
to O
the O
garden. O
Emma O
had O
on O
purpose O
taken O
away O
the O
key O
of O
the O
gate, O
which O
Charles O
thought O
lost. O
To O
call O
her, O
Rodolphe O
threw O
a O
sprinkle O
of O
sand O
at O
the O
shutters. O
She O
jumped O
up O
with O
a O
start; O
but O
sometimes O
he O
had O
to O
wait, O
for O
Charles O
had O
a O
mania O
for O
chatting O
by O
the O
fireside, O
and O
he O
would O
not O
stop. O
She O
was O
wild O
with O
impatience; O
if O
her O
eyes O
could O
have O
done O
it, O
she O
would O
have O
hurled O
him O
out O
at O
the O
window. O
At O
last O
she O
would O
begin O
to O
undress, O
then O
take O
up O
a O
book, O
and O
go O
on O
reading O
very O
quietly O
as O
if O
the O
book O
amused O
her. O
But O
Charles, O
who O
was O
in O
bed, O
called O
to O
her O
to O
come O
too. O
"Come, O
now, O
Emma," O
he O
said, O
"it O
is O
time." O
"Yes, O
I O
am O
coming," O
she O
answered. O
Then, O
as O
the O
candles O
dazzled O
him; O
he O
turned O
to O
the O
wall O
and O
fell O
asleep. O
She O
escaped, O
smiling, O
palpitating, O
undressed. O
Rodolphe O
had O
a O
large O
cloak; O
he O
wrapped O
her O
in O
it, O
and O
putting O
his O
arm O
round O
her O
waist, O
he O
drew O
her O
without O
a O
word O
to O
the O
end O
of O
the O
garden. O
It O
was O
in O
the O
arbour, O
on O
the O
same O
seat O
of O
old O
sticks O
where O
formerly O
Leon O
had O
looked O
at O
her O
so O
amorously O
on O
the O
summer O
evenings. O
She O
never O
thought O
of O
him O
now. O
The O
stars O
shone O
through O
the O
leafless O
jasmine O
branches. O
Behind O
them O
they O
heard O
the O
river O
flowing, O
and O
now O
and O
again O
on O
the O
bank O
the O
rustling O
of O
the O
dry O
reeds. O
Masses O
of O
shadow O
here O
and O
there O
loomed O
out O
in O
the O
darkness, O
and O
sometimes, O
vibrating O
with O
one O
movement, O
they O
rose O
up O
and O
swayed O
like O
immense O
black O
waves O
pressing O
forward O
to O
engulf O
them. O
The O
cold O
of O
the O
nights O
made O
them O
clasp O
closer; O
the O
sighs O
of O
their O
lips O
seemed O
to O
them O
deeper; O
their O
eyes O
that O
they O
could O
hardly O
see, O
larger; O
and O
in O
the O
midst O
of O
the O
silence O
low O
words O
were O
spoken O
that O
fell O
on O
their O
souls O
sonorous, O
crystalline, O
and O
that O
reverberated O
in O
multiplied O
vibrations. O
When O
the O
night O
was O
rainy, O
they O
took O
refuge O
in O
the O
consulting-room O
between O
the O
cart-shed O
and O
the O
stable. O
She O
lighted O
one O
of O
the O
kitchen O
candles O
that O
she O
had O
hidden O
behind O
the O
books. O
Rodolphe O
settled O
down O
there O
as O
if O
at O
home. O
The O
sight O
of O
the O
library, O
of O
the O
bureau, O
of O
the O
whole O
apartment, O
in O
fine, O
excited O
his O
merriment, O
and O
he O
could O
not O
refrain O
from O
making O
jokes O
about O
Charles, O
which O
rather O
embarrassed O
Emma. O
She O
would O
have O
liked O
to O
see O
him O
more O
serious, O
and O
even O
on O
occasions O
more O
dramatic; O
as, O
for O
example, O
when O
she O
thought O
she O
heard O
a O
noise O
of O
approaching O
steps O
in O
the O
alley. O
"Someone O
is O
coming!" O
she O
said. O
He O
blew O
out O
the O
light. O
"Have O
you O
your O
pistols?" O
"Why?" O
"Why, O
to O
defend O
yourself," O
replied O
Emma. O
"From O
your O
husband? O
Oh, O
poor O
devil!" O
And O
Rodolphe O
finished O
his O
sentence O
with O
a O
gesture O
that O
said, O
"I O
could O
crush O
him O
with O
a O
flip O
of O
my O
finger." O
She O
was O
wonder-stricken O
at O
his O
bravery, O
although O
she O
felt O
in O
it O
a O
sort O
of O
indecency O
and O
a O
naive O
coarseness O
that O
scandalised O
her. O
Rodolphe O
reflected O
a O
good O
deal O
on O
the O
affair O
of O
the O
pistols. O
If O
she O
had O
spoken O
seriously, O
it O
was O
very O
ridiculous, O
he O
thought, O
even O
odious; O
for O
he O
had O
no O
reason O
to O
hate O
the O
good O
Charles, O
not O
being O
what O
is O
called O
devoured O
by O
jealousy; O
and O
on O
this O
subject O
Emma O
had O
taken O
a O
great O
vow O
that O
he O
did O
not O
think O
in O
the O
best O
of O
taste. O
Besides, O
she O
was O
growing O
very O
sentimental. O
She O
had O
insisted O
on O
exchanging O
miniatures; O
they O
had O
cut O
off O
handfuls O
of O
hair, O
and O
now O
she O
was O
asking O
for O
a O
ring O
-- O
a O
real O
wedding-ring, O
in O
sign O
of O
an O
eternal O
union. O
She O
often O
spoke O
to O
him O
of O
the O
evening O
chimes, O
of O
the O
voices O
of O
nature. O
Then O
she O
talked O
to O
him O
of O
her O
mother-- O
hers! O
and O
of O
his O
mother-- O
his! O
Rodolphe O
had O
lost O
his O
twenty O
years O
ago. O
Emma O
none O
the O
less O
consoled O
him O
with O
caressing O
words O
as O
one O
would O
have O
done O
a O
lost O
child, O
and O
she O
sometimes O
even O
said O
to O
him, O
gazing O
at O
the O
moon-- O
"I O
am O
sure O
that O
above O
there O
together O
they O
approve O
of O
our O
love." O
But O
she O
was O
so O
pretty. O
He O
had O
possessed O
so O
few O
women O
of O
such O
ingenuousness. O
This O
love O
without O
debauchery O
was O
a O
new O
experience O
for O
him, O
and, O
drawing O
him O
out O
of O
his O
lazy O
habits, O
caressed O
at O
once O
his O
pride O
and O
his O
sensuality. O
Emma's O
enthusiasm, O
which O
his O
bourgeois O
good O
sense O
disdained, O
seemed O
to O
him O
in O
his O
heart O
of O
hearts O
charming, O
since O
it O
was O
lavished O
on O
him. O
Then, O
sure O
of O
being O
loved, O
he O
no O
longer O
kept O
up O
appearances, O
and O
insensibly O
his O
ways O
changed. O
He O
had O
no O
longer, O
as O
formerly, O
words O
so O
gentle O
that O
they O
made O
her O
cry, O
nor O
passionate O
caresses O
that O
made O
her O
mad, O
so O
that O
their O
great O
love, O
which O
engrossed O
her O
life, O
seemed O
to O
lessen O
beneath O
her O
like O
the O
water O
of O
a O
stream O
absorbed O
into O
its O
channel, O
and O
she O
could O
see O
the O
bed O
of O
it. O
She O
would O
not O
believe O
it; O
she O
redoubled O
in O
tenderness, O
and O
Rodolphe O
concealed O
his O
indifference O
less O
and O
less. O
She O
did O
not O
know O
if O
she O
regretted O
having O
yielded O
to O
him, O
or O
whether O
she O
did O
not O
wish, O
on O
the O
contrary, O
to O
enjoy O
him O
the O
more. O
The O
humiliation O
of O
feeling O
herself O
weak O
was O
turning O
to O
rancour, O
tempered O
by O
their O
voluptuous O
pleasures. O
It O
was O
not O
affection; O
it O
was O
like O
a O
continual O
seduction. O
He O
subjugated O
her; O
she O
almost O
feared O
him. O
Appearances, O
nevertheless, O
were O
calmer O
than O
ever, O
Rodolphe O
having O
succeeded O
in O
carrying O
out O
the O
adultery O
after O
his O
own O
fancy; O
and O
at O
the O
end O
of O
six O
months, O
when O
the O
spring-time O
came, O
they O
were O
to O
one O
another O
like O
a O
married O
couple, O
tranquilly O
keeping O
up O
a O
domestic O
flame. O
It O
was O
the O
time O
of O
year O
when O
old O
Rouault O
sent O
his O
turkey O
in O
remembrance O
of O
the O
setting O
of O
his O
leg. O
The O
present O
always O
arrived O
with O
a O
letter. O
Emma O
cut O
the O
string O
that O
tied O
it O
to O
the O
basket, O
and O
read O
the O
following O
lines:-- O
"My O
Dear O
Children O
-- O
I O
hope O
this O
will O
find O
you O
well, O
and O
that O
this O
one O
will O
be O
as O
good O
as O
the O
others. O
For O
it O
seems O
to O
me O
a O
little O
more O
tender, O
if O
I O
may O
venture O
to O
say O
so, O
and O
heavier. O
But O
next O
time, O
for O
a O
change, O
I'll O
give O
you O
a O
turkeycock, O
unless O
you O
have O
a O
preference O
for O
some O
dabs; O
and O
send O
me O
back O
the O
hamper, O
if O
you O
please, O
with O
the O
two O
old O
ones. O
I O
have O
had O
an O
accident O
with O
my O
cart-sheds, O
whose O
covering O
flew O
off O
one O
windy O
night O
among O
the O
trees. O
The O
harvest O
has O
not O
been O
overgood O
either. O
Finally, O
I O
don't O
know O
when O
I O
shall O
come O
to O
see O
you. O
It O
is O
so O
difficult O
now O
to O
leave O
the O
house O
since O
I O
am O
alone, O
my O
poor O
Emma." O
Here O
there O
was O
a O
break O
in O
the O
lines, O
as O
if O
the O
old O
fellow O
had O
dropped O
his O
pen O
to O
dream O
a O
little O
while. O
"For O
myself, O
I O
am O
very O
well, O
except O
for O
a O
cold O
I O
caught O
the O
other O
day O
at O
the O
fair O
at O
Yvetot, O
where O
I O
had O
gone O
to O
hire O
a O
shepherd, O
having O
turned O
away O
mine O
because O
he O
was O
too O
dainty. O
How O
we O
are O
to O
be O
pitied O
with O
such O
a O
lot O
of O
thieves! O
Besides, O
he O
was O
also O
rude. O
I O
heard O
from O
a O
pedlar, O
who, O
travelling O
through O
your O
part O
of O
the O
country O
this O
winter, O
had O
a O
tooth O
drawn, O
that O
Bovary O
was O
as O
usual O
working O
hard. O
That O
doesn't O
surprise O
me; O
and O
he O
showed O
me O
his O
tooth; O
we O
had O
some O
coffee O
together. O
I O
asked O
him O
if O
he O
had O
seen O
you, O
and O
he O
said O
not, O
but O
that O
he O
had O
seen O
two O
horses O
in O
the O
stables, O
from O
which O
I O
conclude O
that O
business O
is O
looking O
up. O
So O
much O
the O
better, O
my O
dear O
children, O
and O
may O
God O
send O
you O
every O
imaginable O
happiness! O
It O
grieves O
me O
not O
yet O
to O
have O
seen O
my O
dear O
little O
grand-daughter, O
Berthe O
Bovary. O
I O
have O
planted O
an O
Orleans O
plum-tree O
for O
her O
in O
the O
garden O
under O
your O
room, O
and O
I O
won't O
have O
it O
touched O
unless O
it O
is O
to O
have O
jam O
made O
for O
her O
by O
and O
bye, O
that O
I O
will O
keep O
in O
the O
cupboard O
for O
her O
when O
she O
comes. O
 O
Good-bye, O
my O
dear O
children. O
I O
kiss O
you, O
my O
girl, O
you O
too, O
my O
son-in-law, O
and O
the O
little O
one O
on O
both O
cheeks. O
I O
am, O
with O
best O
compliments, O
your O
loving O
father. O
 O
Theodore O
Rouault." O
She O
held O
the O
coarse O
paper O
in O
her O
fingers O
for O
some O
minutes. O
The O
spelling O
mistakes O
were O
interwoven O
one O
with O
the O
other, O
and O
Emma O
followed O
the O
kindly O
thought O
that O
cackled O
right O
through O
it O
like O
a O
hen O
half O
hidden O
in O
the O
hedge O
of O
thorns. O
The O
writing O
had O
been O
dried O
with O
ashes O
from O
the O
hearth, O
for O
a O
little O
grey O
powder O
slipped O
from O
the O
letter O
on O
to O
her O
dress, O
and O
she O
almost O
thought O
she O
saw O
her O
father O
bending O
over O
the O
hearth O
to O
take O
up O
the O
tongs. O
How O
long O
since O
she O
had O
been O
with O
him, O
sitting O
on O
the O
footstool O
in O
the O
chimney-corner, O
where O
she O
used O
to O
burn O
the O
end O
of O
a O
bit O
of O
wood O
in O
the O
great O
flame O
of O
the O
sea-sedges! O
She O
remembered O
the O
summer O
evenings O
all O
full O
of O
sunshine. O
The O
colts O
neighed O
when O
anyone O
passed O
by, O
and O
galloped, O
galloped. O
Under O
her O
window O
there O
was O
a O
beehive, O
and O
sometimes O
the O
bees O
wheeling O
round O
in O
the O
light O
struck O
against O
her O
window O
like O
rebounding O
balls O
of O
gold. O
What O
happiness O
there O
had O
been O
at O
that O
time, O
what O
freedom, O
what O
hope! O
What O
an O
abundance O
of O
illusions! O
Nothing O
was O
left O
of O
them O
now. O
She O
had O
got O
rid O
of O
them O
all O
in O
her O
soul's O
life, O
in O
all O
her O
successive O
conditions O
of O
life, O
maidenhood, O
her O
marriage, O
and O
her O
love-- O
thus O
constantly O
losing O
them O
all O
her O
life O
through, O
like O
a O
traveller O
who O
leaves O
something O
of O
his O
wealth O
at O
every O
inn O
along O
his O
road. O
But O
what O
then, O
made O
her O
so O
unhappy? O
What O
was O
the O
extraordinary O
catastrophe O
that O
had O
transformed O
her? O
And O
she O
raised O
her O
head, O
looking O
round O
as O
if O
to O
seek O
the O
cause O
of O
that O
which O
made O
her O
suffer. O
An O
April O
ray O
was O
dancing O
on O
the O
china O
of O
the O
whatnot; O
the O
fire O
burned; O
beneath O
her O
slippers O
she O
felt O
the O
softness O
of O
the O
carpet; O
the O
day O
was O
bright, O
the O
air O
warm, O
and O
she O
heard O
her O
child O
shouting O
with O
laughter. O
In O
fact, O
the O
little O
girl O
was O
just O
then O
rolling O
on O
the O
lawn O
in O
the O
midst O
of O
the O
grass O
that O
was O
being O
turned. O
She O
was O
lying O
flat O
on O
her O
stomach O
at O
the O
top O
of O
a O
rick. O
The O
servant O
was O
holding O
her O
by O
her O
skirt. O
Lestiboudois O
was O
raking O
by O
her O
side, O
and O
every O
time O
he O
came O
near O
she O
lent O
forward, O
beating O
the O
air O
with O
both O
her O
arms. O
"Bring O
her O
to O
me," O
said O
her O
mother, O
rushing O
to O
embrace O
her. O
"How O
I O
love O
you, O
my O
poor O
child! O
How O
I O
love O
you!" O
Then O
noticing O
that O
the O
tips O
of O
her O
ears O
were O
rather O
dirty, O
she O
rang O
at O
once O
for O
warm O
water, O
and O
washed O
her, O
changed O
her O
linen, O
her O
stockings, O
her O
shoes, O
asked O
a O
thousand O
questions O
about O
her O
health, O
as O
if O
on O
the O
return O
from O
a O
long O
journey, O
and O
finally, O
kissing O
her O
again O
and O
crying O
a O
little, O
she O
gave O
her O
back O
to O
the O
servant, O
who O
stood O
quite O
thunderstricken O
at O
this O
excess O
of O
tenderness. O
That O
evening O
Rodolphe O
found O
her O
more O
serious O
than O
usual. O
"That O
will O
pass O
over," O
he O
concluded; O
"it's O
a O
whim:" O
And O
he O
missed O
three O
rendezvous O
running. O
When O
he O
did O
come, O
she O
showed O
herself O
cold O
and O
almost O
contemptuous. O
"Ah! O
you're O
losing O
your O
time, O
my O
lady!" O
And O
he O
pretended O
not O
to O
notice O
her O
melancholy O
sighs, O
nor O
the O
handkerchief O
she O
took O
out. O
Then O
Emma O
repented. O
She O
even O
asked O
herself O
why O
she O
detested O
Charles; O
if O
it O
had O
not O
been O
better O
to O
have O
been O
able O
to O
love O
him? O
But O
he O
gave O
her O
no O
opportunities O
for O
such O
a O
revival O
of O
sentiment, O
so O
that O
she O
was O
much O
embarrassed O
by O
her O
desire O
for O
sacrifice, O
when O
the O
druggist O
came O
just O
in O
time O
to O
provide O
her O
with O
an O
opportunity. O
CHAPTER O
ELEVEN O
He O
had O
recently O
read O
a O
eulogy O
on O
a O
new O
method O
for O
curing O
club-foot, O
and O
as O
he O
was O
a O
partisan O
of O
progress, O
he O
conceived O
the O
patriotic O
idea O
that O
Yonville, O
in O
order O
to O
keep O
to O
the O
fore, O
ought O
to O
have O
some O
operations O
for O
strephopody O
or O
club-foot. O
"For," O
said O
he O
to O
Emma, O
"what O
risk O
is O
there? O
See O
-- O
" O
(and O
he O
enumerated O
on O
his O
fingers O
the O
advantages O
of O
the O
attempt), O
"success, O
almost O
certain O
relief O
and O
beautifying O
of O
the O
patient, O
celebrity O
acquired O
by O
the O
operator. O
Why, O
for O
example, O
should O
not O
your O
husband O
relieve O
poor O
Hippolyte O
of O
the O
'Lion O
d'Or'? O
Note O
that O
he O
would O
not O
fail O
to O
tell O
about O
his O
cure O
to O
all O
the O
travellers, O
and O
then" O
(Homais O
lowered O
his O
voice O
and O
looked O
round O
him) O
"who O
is O
to O
prevent O
me O
from O
sending O
a O
short O
paragraph O
on O
the O
subject O
to O
the O
paper? O
Eh! O
goodness O
me! O
an O
article O
gets O
about; O
it O
is O
talked O
of; O
it O
ends O
by O
making O
a O
snowball! O
And O
who O
knows? O
who O
knows?" O
In O
fact, O
Bovary O
might O
succeed. O
Nothing O
proved O
to O
Emma O
that O
he O
was O
not O
clever; O
and O
what O
a O
satisfaction O
for O
her O
to O
have O
urged O
him O
to O
a O
step O
by O
which O
his O
reputation O
and O
fortune O
would O
be O
increased! O
She O
only O
wished O
to O
lean O
on O
something O
more O
solid O
than O
love. O
Charles, O
urged O
by O
the O
druggist O
and O
by O
her, O
allowed O
himself O
to O
be O
persuaded. O
He O
sent O
to O
Rouen O
for O
Dr. O
Duval's O
volume, O
and O
every O
evening, O
holding O
his O
head O
between O
both O
hands, O
plunged O
into O
the O
reading O
of O
it. O
While O
he O
was O
studying O
equinus, O
varus, O
and O
valgus, O
that O
is O
to O
say, O
katastrephopody, O
endostrephopody, O
and O
exostrephopody O
(or O
better, O
the O
various O
turnings O
of O
the O
foot O
downwards, O
inwards, O
and O
outwards, O
with O
the O
hypostrephopody O
and O
anastrephopody), O
otherwise O
torsion O
downwards O
and O
upwards, O
Monsier O
Homais, O
with O
all O
sorts O
of O
arguments, O
was O
exhorting O
the O
lad O
at O
the O
inn O
to O
submit O
to O
the O
operation. O
"You O
will O
scarcely O
feel, O
probably, O
a O
slight O
pain; O
it O
is O
a O
simple O
prick, O
like O
a O
little O
blood-letting, O
less O
than O
the O
extraction O
of O
certain O
corns." O
Hippolyte, O
reflecting, O
rolled O
his O
stupid O
eyes. O
"However," O
continued O
the O
chemist, O
"it O
doesn't O
concern O
me. O
It's O
for O
your O
sake, O
for O
pure O
humanity! O
I O
should O
like O
to O
see O
you, O
my O
friend, O
rid O
of O
your O
hideous O
caudication, O
together O
with O
that O
waddling O
of O
the O
lumbar O
regions O
which, O
whatever O
you O
say, O
must O
considerably O
interfere O
with O
you O
in O
the O
exercise O
of O
your O
calling." O
Then O
Homais O
represented O
to O
him O
how O
much O
jollier O
and O
brisker O
he O
would O
feel O
afterwards, O
and O
even O
gave O
him O
to O
understand O
that O
he O
would O
be O
more O
likely O
to O
please O
the O
women; O
and O
the O
stable-boy O
began O
to O
smile O
heavily. O
Then O
he O
attacked O
him O
through O
his O
vanity: O
"Aren't O
you O
a O
man? O
Hang O
it! O
what O
would O
you O
have O
done O
if O
you O
had O
had O
to O
go O
into O
the O
army, O
to O
go O
and O
fight O
beneath O
the O
standard? O
Ah! O
Hippolyte!" O
And O
Homais O
retired, O
declaring O
that O
he O
could O
not O
understand O
this O
obstinacy, O
this O
blindness O
in O
refusing O
the O
benefactions O
of O
science. O
The O
poor O
fellow O
gave O
way, O
for O
it O
was O
like O
a O
conspiracy. O
Binet, O
who O
never O
interfered O
with O
other O
people's O
business, O
Madame O
Lefrancois, O
Artemise, O
the O
neighbours, O
even O
the O
mayor, O
Monsieur O
Tuvache-- O
everyone O
persuaded O
him, O
lectured O
him, O
shamed O
him; O
but O
what O
finally O
decided O
him O
was O
that O
it O
would O
cost O
him O
nothing. O
Bovary O
even O
undertook O
to O
provide O
the O
machine O
for O
the O
operation. O
This O
generosity O
was O
an O
idea O
of O
Emma's, O
and O
Charles O
consented O
to O
it, O
thinking O
in O
his O
heart O
of O
hearts O
that O
his O
wife O
was O
an O
angel. O
So O
by O
the O
advice O
of O
the O
chemist, O
and O
after O
three O
fresh O
starts, O
he O
had O
a O
kind O
of O
box O
made O
by O
the O
carpenter, O
with O
the O
aid O
of O
the O
locksmith, O
that O
weighed O
about O
eight O
pounds, O
and O
in O
which O
iron, O
wood, O
sheer-iron, O
leather, O
screws, O
and O
nuts O
had O
not O
been O
spared. O
But O
to O
know O
which O
of O
Hippolyte's O
tendons O
to O
cut, O
it O
was O
necessary O
first O
of O
all O
to O
find O
out O
what O
kind O
of O
club-foot O
he O
had. O
He O
had O
a O
foot O
forming O
almost O
a O
straight O
line O
with O
the O
leg, O
which, O
however, O
did O
not O
prevent O
it O
from O
being O
turned O
in, O
so O
that O
it O
was O
an O
equinus O
together O
with O
something O
of O
a O
varus, O
or O
else O
a O
slight O
varus O
with O
a O
strong O
tendency O
to O
equinus. O
But O
with O
this O
equinus, O
wide O
in O
foot O
like O
a O
horse's O
hoof, O
with O
rugose O
skin, O
dry O
tendons, O
and O
large O
toes, O
on O
which O
the O
black O
nails O
looked O
as O
if O
made O
of O
iron, O
the O
clubfoot O
ran O
about O
like O
a O
deer O
from O
morn O
till O
night. O
He O
was O
constantly O
to O
be O
seen O
on O
the O
Place, O
jumping O
round O
the O
carts, O
thrusting O
his O
limping O
foot O
forwards. O
He O
seemed O
even O
stronger O
on O
that O
leg O
than O
the O
other. O
By O
dint O
of O
hard O
service O
it O
had O
acquired, O
as O
it O
were, O
moral O
qualities O
of O
patience O
and O
energy; O
and O
when O
he O
was O
given O
some O
heavy O
work, O
he O
stood O
on O
it O
in O
preference O
to O
its O
fellow. O
Now, O
as O
it O
was O
an O
equinus, O
it O
was O
necessary O
to O
cut O
the O
tendon O
of O
Achilles, O
and, O
if O
need O
were, O
the O
anterior O
tibial O
muscle O
could O
be O
seen O
to O
afterwards O
for O
getting O
rid O
of O
the O
varus; O
for O
the O
doctor O
did O
not O
dare O
to O
risk O
both O
operations O
at O
once; O
he O
was O
even O
trembling O
already O
for O
fear O
of O
injuring O
some O
important O
region O
that O
he O
did O
not O
know. O
Neither O
Ambrose O
Pare, O
applying O
for O
the O
first O
time O
since O
Celsus, O
after O
an O
interval O
of O
fifteen O
centuries, O
a O
ligature O
to O
an O
artery, O
nor O
Dupuytren, O
about O
to O
open O
an O
abscess O
in O
the O
brain, O
nor O
Gensoul O
when O
he O
first O
took O
away O
the O
superior O
maxilla, O
had O
hearts O
that O
trembled, O
hands O
that O
shook, O
minds O
so O
strained O
as O
Monsieur O
Bovary O
when O
he O
approached O
Hippolyte, O
his O
tenotome O
between O
his O
fingers. O
And O
as O
at O
hospitals, O
near O
by O
on O
a O
table O
lay O
a O
heap O
of O
lint, O
with O
waxed O
thread, O
many O
bandages O
-- O
a O
pyramid O
of O
bandages-- O
every O
bandage O
to O
be O
found O
at O
the O
druggist's. O
It O
was O
Monsieur O
Homais O
who O
since O
morning O
had O
been O
organising O
all O
these O
preparations, O
as O
much O
to O
dazzle O
the O
multitude O
as O
to O
keep O
up O
his O
illusions. O
Charles O
pierced O
the O
skin; O
a O
dry O
crackling O
was O
heard. O
The O
tendon O
was O
cut, O
the O
operation O
over. O
Hippolyte O
could O
not O
get O
over O
his O
surprise, O
but O
bent O
over O
Bovary's O
hands O
to O
cover O
them O
with O
kisses. O
"Come, O
be O
calm," O
said O
the O
druggist; O
"later O
on O
you O
will O
show O
your O
gratitude O
to O
your O
benefactor." O
And O
he O
went O
down O
to O
tell O
the O
result O
to O
five O
or O
six O
inquirers O
who O
were O
waiting O
in O
the O
yard, O
and O
who O
fancied O
that O
Hippolyte O
would O
reappear O
walking O
properly. O
Then O
Charles, O
having O
buckled O
his O
patient O
into O
the O
machine, O
went O
home, O
where O
Emma, O
all O
anxiety, O
awaited O
him O
at O
the O
door. O
She O
threw O
herself O
on O
his O
neck; O
they O
sat O
down O
to O
table; O
he O
ate O
much, O
and O
at O
dessert O
he O
even O
wanted O
to O
take O
a O
cup O
of O
coffee, O
a O
luxury O
he O
only O
permitted O
himself O
on O
Sundays O
when O
there O
was O
company. O
The O
evening O
was O
charming, O
full O
of O
prattle, O
of O
dreams O
together. O
They O
talked O
about O
their O
future O
fortune, O
of O
the O
improvements O
to O
be O
made O
in O
their O
house; O
he O
saw O
people's O
estimation O
of O
him O
growing, O
his O
comforts O
increasing, O
his O
wife O
always O
loving O
him; O
and O
she O
was O
happy O
to O
refresh O
herself O
with O
a O
new O
sentiment, O
healthier, O
better, O
to O
feel O
at O
last O
some O
tenderness O
for O
this O
poor O
fellow O
who O
adored O
her. O
The O
thought O
of O
Rodolphe O
for O
one O
moment O
passed O
through O
her O
mind, O
but O
her O
eyes O
turned O
again O
to O
Charles; O
she O
even O
noticed O
with O
surprise O
that O
he O
had O
not O
bad O
teeth. O
They O
were O
in O
bed O
when O
Monsieur O
Homais, O
in O
spite O
of O
the O
servant, O
suddenly O
entered O
the O
room, O
holding O
in O
his O
hand O
a O
sheet O
of O
paper O
just O
written. O
It O
was O
the O
paragraph O
he O
intended O
for O
the O
"Fanal O
de O
Rouen." O
He O
brought O
it O
for O
them O
to O
read. O
"Read O
it O
yourself," O
said O
Bovary. O
HE O
READ-- O
"'Despite O
the O
prejudices O
that O
still O
invest O
a O
part O
of O
the O
face O
of O
Europe O
like O
a O
net, O
the O
light O
nevertheless O
begins O
to O
penetrate O
our O
country O
places. O
Thus O
on O
Tuesday O
our O
little O
town O
of O
Yonville O
found O
itself O
the O
scene O
of O
a O
surgical O
operation O
which O
is O
at O
the O
same O
time O
an O
act O
of O
loftiest O
philanthropy. O
Monsieur O
Bovary, O
one O
of O
our O
most O
distinguished O
practitioners-- O
'" O
"Oh, O
that O
is O
too O
much! O
too O
much!" O
said O
Charles, O
choking O
with O
emotion. O
"No, O
no! O
not O
at O
all! O
What O
next!" O
"'-- O
Performed O
an O
operation O
on O
a O
club-footed O
man.' O
I O
have O
not O
used O
the O
scientific O
term, O
because O
you O
know O
in O
a O
newspaper O
everyone O
would O
not O
perhaps O
understand. O
The O
masses O
must-- O
'" O
"No O
doubt," O
said O
Bovary; O
"go O
on!" O
"I O
proceed," O
said O
the O
chemist. O
"'Monsieur O
Bovary, O
one O
of O
our O
most O
distinguished O
practitioners, O
performed O
an O
operation O
on O
a O
club-footed O
man O
called O
Hippolyte O
Tautain, O
stableman O
for O
the O
last O
twenty-five O
years O
at O
the O
hotel O
of O
the O
"Lion O
d'Or," O
kept O
by O
Widow O
Lefrancois, O
at O
the O
Place O
d'Armes. O
The O
novelty O
of O
the O
attempt, O
and O
the O
interest O
incident O
to O
the O
subject, O
had O
attracted O
such O
a O
concourse O
of O
persons O
that O
there O
was O
a O
veritable O
obstruction O
on O
the O
threshold O
of O
the O
establishment. O
The O
operation, O
moreover, O
was O
performed O
as O
if O
by O
magic, O
and O
barely O
a O
few O
drops O
of O
blood O
appeared O
on O
the O
skin, O
as O
though O
to O
say O
that O
the O
rebellious O
tendon O
had O
at O
last O
given O
way O
beneath O
the O
efforts O
of O
art. O
The O
patient, O
strangely O
enough-- O
we O
affirm O
it O
as O
an O
eye-witness-- O
complained O
of O
no O
pain. O
His O
condition O
up O
to O
the O
present O
time O
leaves O
nothing O
to O
be O
desired. O
Everything O
tends O
to O
show O
that O
his O
convelescence O
will O
be O
brief; O
and O
who O
knows O
even O
if O
at O
our O
next O
village O
festivity O
we O
shall O
not O
see O
our O
good O
Hippolyte O
figuring O
in O
the O
bacchic O
dance O
in O
the O
midst O
of O
a O
chorus O
of O
joyous O
boon-companions, O
and O
thus O
proving O
to O
all O
eyes O
by O
his O
verve O
and O
his O
capers O
his O
complete O
cure? O
Honour, O
then, O
to O
the O
generous O
savants! O
Honour O
to O
those O
indefatigable O
spirits O
who O
consecrate O
their O
vigils O
to O
the O
amelioration O
or O
to O
the O
alleviation O
of O
their O
kind! O
Honour, O
thrice O
honour! O
Is O
it O
not O
time O
to O
cry O
that O
the O
blind O

But O
that O
which O
fanaticism O
formerly O
promised O
to O
its O

now O
accomplishes O
for O
all O
men. O
We O
shall O
keep O

This O
did O
not O
prevent O
Mere O
Lefrancois, O
from O
coming O
five O
days O
after, O
scared, O
and O
crying O
out-- O
"Help! O
he O
is O
dying! O
I O
am O
going O
crazy!" O
Charles O
rushed O
to O
the O
"Lion O
d'Or," O
and O
the O
chemist, O
who O
caught O
sight O
of O
him O
passing O
along O
the O
Place O
hatless, O
abandoned O
his O
shop. O
He O
appeared O
himself O
breathless, O
red, O
anxious, O
and O
asking O
everyone O
who O
was O
going O
up O
the O
stairs-- O
"Why, O
what's O
the O
matter O
with O
our O
interesting O
strephopode?" O
The O
strephopode O
was O
writhing O
in O
hideous O
convulsions, O
so O
that O
the O
machine O
in O
which O
his O
leg O
was O
enclosed O
was O
knocked O
against O
the O
wall O
enough O
to O
break O
it. O
With O
many O
precautions, O
in O
order O
not O
to O
disturb O
the O
position O
of O
the O
limb, O
the O
box O
was O
removed, O
and O
an O
awful O
sight O
presented O
itself. O
The O
outlines O
of O
the O
foot O
disappeared O
in O
such O
a O
swelling O
that O
the O
entire O
skin O
seemed O
about O
to O
burst, O
and O
it O
was O
covered O
with O
ecchymosis, O
caused O
by O
the O
famous O
machine. O
Hippolyte O
had O
already O
complained O
of O
suffering O
from O
it. O
No O
attention O
had O
been O
paid O
to O
him; O
they O
had O
to O
acknowledge O
that O
he O
had O
not O
been O
altogether O
wrong, O
and O
he O
was O
freed O
for O
a O
few O
hours. O
But, O
hardly O
had O
the O
oedema O
gone O
down O
to O
some O
extent, O
than O
the O
two O
savants O
thought O
fit O
to O
put O
back O
the O
limb O
in O
the O
apparatus, O
strapping O
it O
tighter O
to O
hasten O
matters. O
At O
last, O
three O
days O
after, O
Hippolyte O
being O
unable O
to O
endure O
it O
any O
longer, O
they O
once O
more O
removed O
the O
machine, O
and O
were O
much O
surprised O
at O
the O
result O
they O
saw. O
The O
livid O
tumefaction O
spread O
over O
the O
leg, O
with O
blisters O
here O
and O
there, O
whence O
there O
oozed O
a O
black O
liquid. O
Matters O
were O
taking O
a O
serious O
turn. O
Hippolyte O
began O
to O
worry O
himself, O
and O
Mere O
Lefrancois, O
had O
him O
installed O
in O
the O
little O
room O
near O
the O
kitchen, O
so O
that O
he O
might O
at O
least O
have O
some O
distraction. O
But O
the O
tax-collector, O
who O
dined O
there O
every O
day, O
complained O
bitterly O
of O
such O
companionship. O
Then O
Hippolyte O
was O
removed O
to O
the O
billiard-room. O
He O
lay O
there O
moaning O
under O
his O
heavy O
coverings, O
pale O
with O
long O
beard, O
sunken O
eyes, O
and O
from O
time O
to O
time O
turning O
his O
perspiring O
head O
on O
the O
dirty O
pillow, O
where O
the O
flies O
alighted. O
Madame O
Bovary O
went O
to O
see O
him. O
She O
brought O
him O
linen O
for O
his O
poultices; O
she O
comforted, O
and O
encouraged O
him. O
Besides, O
he O
did O
not O
want O
for O
company, O
especially O
on O
market-days, O
when O
the O
peasants O
were O
knocking O
about O
the O
billiard-balls O
round O
him, O
fenced O
with O
the O
cues, O
smoked, O
drank, O
sang, O
and O
brawled. O
"How O
are O
you?" O
they O
said, O
clapping O
him O
on O
the O
shoulder. O
"Ah! O
you're O
not O
up O
to O
much, O
it O
seems, O
but O
it's O
your O
own O
fault. O
You O
should O
do O
this! O
do O
that!" O
And O
then O
they O
told O
him O
stories O
of O
people O
who O
had O
all O
been O
cured O
by O
other O
remedies O
than O
his. O
Then O
by O
way O
of O
consolation O
they O
added-- O
"You O
give O
way O
too O
much! O
Get O
up! O
You O
coddle O
yourself O
like O
a O
king! O
All O
the O
same, O
old O
chap, O
you O
don't O
smell O
nice!" O
Gangrene, O
in O
fact, O
was O
spreading O
more O
and O
more. O
Bovary O
himself O
turned O
sick O
at O
it. O
He O
came O
every O
hour, O
every O
moment. O
Hippolyte O
looked O
at O
him O
with O
eyes O
full O
of O
terror, O
sobbing-- O
"When O
shall O
I O
get O
well? O
Oh, O
save O
me! O
How O
unfortunate O
I O
am! O
How O
unfortunate O
I O
am!" O
And O
the O
doctor O
left, O
always O
recommending O
him O
to O
diet O
himself. O
"Don't O
listen O
to O
him, O
my O
lad," O
said O
Mere O
Lefrancois, O
"Haven't O
they O
tortured O
you O
enough O
already? O
You'll O
grow O
still O
weaker. O
Here! O
swallow O
this." O
And O
she O
gave O
him O
some O
good O
beef-tea, O
a O
slice O
of O
mutton, O
a O
piece O
of O
bacon, O
and O
sometimes O
small O
glasses O
of O
brandy, O
that O
he O
had O
not O
the O
strength O
to O
put O
to O
his O
lips. O
Abbe O
Bournisien, O
hearing O
that O
he O
was O
growing O
worse, O
asked O
to O
see O
him. O
He O
began O
by O
pitying O
his O
sufferings, O
declaring O
at O
the O
same O
time O
that O
he O
ought O
to O
rejoice O
at O
them O
since O
it O
was O
the O
will O
of O
the O
Lord, O
and O
take O
advantage O
of O
the O
occasion O
to O
reconcile O
himself O
to O
Heaven. O
"For," O
said O
the O
ecclesiastic O
in O
a O
paternal O
tone, O
"you O
rather O
neglected O
your O
duties; O
you O
were O
rarely O
seen O
at O
divine O
worship. O
How O
many O
years O
is O
it O
since O
you O
approached O
the O
holy O
table? O
I O
understand O
that O
your O
work, O
that O
the O
whirl O
of O
the O
world O
may O
have O
kept O
you O
from O
care O
for O
your O
salvation. O
But O
now O
is O
the O
time O
to O
reflect. O
Yet O
don't O
despair. O
I O
have O
known O
great O
sinners, O
who, O
about O
to O
appear O
before O
God O
(you O
are O
not O
yet O
at O
this O
point O
I O
know), O
had O
implored O
His O
mercy, O
and O
who O
certainly O
died O
in O
the O
best O
frame O
of O
mind. O
Let O
us O
hope O
that, O
like O
them, O
you O
will O
set O
us O
a O
good O
example. O
Thus, O
as O
a O
precaution, O
what O
is O
to O
prevent O
you O
from O
saying O
morning O
and O
evening O
a O
'Hail O
Mary, O
full O
of O
grace,' O
and O
'Our O
Father O
which O
art O
in O
heaven'? O
Yes, O
do O
that, O
for O
my O
sake, O
to O
oblige O
me. O
That O
won't O
cost O
you O
anything. O
Will O
you O
promise O
me?" O
The O
poor O
devil O
promised. O
The O
cure O
came O
back O
day O
after O
day. O
He O
chatted O
with O
the O
landlady; O
and O
even O
told O
anecdotes O
interspersed O
with O
jokes O
and O
puns O
that O
Hippolyte O
did O
not O
understand. O
Then, O
as O
soon O
as O
he O
could, O
he O
fell O
back O
upon O
matters O
of O
religion, O
putting O
on O
an O
appropriate O
expression O
of O
face. O
His O
zeal O
seemed O
successful, O
for O
the O
club-foot O
soon O
manifested O
a O
desire O
to O
go O
on O
a O
pilgrimage O
to O
Bon-Secours O
if O
he O
were O
cured; O
to O
which O
Monsieur O
Bournisien O
replied O
that O
he O
saw O
no O
objection; O
two O
precautions O
were O
better O
than O
one; O
it O
was O
no O
risk O
anyhow. O
The O
druggist O
was O
indignant O
at O
what O
he O
called O
the O
manoeuvres O
of O
the O
priest; O
they O
were O
prejudicial, O
he O
said, O
to O
Hippolyte's O
convalescence, O
and O
he O
kept O
repeating O
to O
Madame O
Lefrancois, O
"Leave O
him O
alone! O
leave O
him O
alone! O
You O
perturb O
his O
morals O
with O
your O
mysticism." O
But O
the O
good O
woman O
would O
no O
longer O
listen O
to O
him; O
he O
was O
the O
cause O
of O
it O
all. O
From O
a O
spirit O
of O
contradiction O
she O
hung O
up O
near O
the O
bedside O
of O
the O
patient O
a O
basin O
filled O
with O
holy-water O
and O
a O
branch O
of O
box. O
Religion, O
however, O
seemed O
no O
more O
able O
to O
succour O
him O
than O
surgery, O
and O
the O
invincible O
gangrene O
still O
spread O
from O
the O
extremities O
towards O
the O
stomach. O
It O
was O
all O
very O
well O
to O
vary O
the O
potions O
and O
change O
the O
poultices; O
the O
muscles O
each O
day O
rotted O
more O
and O
more; O
and O
at O
last O
Charles O
replied O
by O
an O
affirmative O
nod O
of O
the O
head O
when O
Mere O
Lefrancois, O
asked O
him O
if O
she O
could O
not, O
as O
a O
forlorn O
hope, O
send O
for O
Monsieur O
Canivet O
of O
Neufchatel, O
who O
was O
a O
celebrity. O
A O
doctor O
of O
medicine, O
fifty O
years O
of O
age, O
enjoying O
a O
good O
position O
and O
self-possessed, O
Charles's O
colleague O
did O
not O
refrain O
from O
laughing O
disdainfully O
when O
he O
had O
uncovered O
the O
leg, O
mortified O
to O
the O
knee. O
Then O
having O
flatly O
declared O
that O
it O
must O
be O
amputated, O
he O
went O
off O
to O
the O
chemist's O
to O
rail O
at O
the O
asses O
who O
could O
have O
reduced O
a O
poor O
man O
to O
such O
a O
state. O
Shaking O
Monsieur O
Homais O
by O
the O
button O
of O
his O
coat, O
he O
shouted O
out O
in O
the O
shop-- O
"These O
are O
the O
inventions O
of O
Paris! O
These O
are O
the O
ideas O
of O
those O
gentry O
of O
the O
capital! O
It O
is O
like O
strabismus, O
chloroform, O
lithotrity, O
a O
heap O
of O
monstrosities O
that O
the O
Government O
ought O
to O
prohibit. O
But O
they O
want O
to O
do O
the O
clever, O
and O
they O
cram O
you O
with O
remedies O
without, O
troubling O
about O
the O
consequences. O
We O
are O
not O
so O
clever, O
not O
we! O
We O
are O
not O
savants, O
coxcombs, O
fops! O
We O
are O
practitioners; O
we O
cure O
people, O
and O
we O
should O
not O
dream O
of O
operating O
on O
anyone O
who O
is O
in O
perfect O
health. O
Straighten O
club-feet! O
As O
if O
one O
could O
straighten O
club-feet! O
It O
is O
as O
if O
one O
wished, O
for O
example, O
to O
make O
a O
hunchback O
straight!" O
Homais O
suffered O
as O
he O
listened O
to O
this O
discourse, O
and O
he O
concealed O
his O
discomfort O
beneath O
a O
courtier's O
smile; O
for O
he O
needed O
to O
humour O
Monsier O
Canivet, O
whose O
prescriptions O
sometimes O
came O
as O
far O
as O
Yonville. O
So O
he O
did O
not O
take O
up O
the O
defence O
of O
Bovary; O
he O
did O
not O
even O
make O
a O
single O
remark, O
and, O
renouncing O
his O
principles, O
he O
sacrificed O
his O
dignity O
to O
the O
more O
serious O
interests O
of O
his O
business. O
This O
amputation O
of O
the O
thigh O
by O
Doctor O
Canivet O
was O
a O
great O
event O
in O
the O
village. O
On O
that O
day O
all O
the O
inhabitants O
got O
up O
earlier, O
and O
the O
Grande O
Rue, O
although O
full O
of O
people, O
had O
something O
lugubrious O
about O
it, O
as O
if O
an O
execution O
had O
been O
expected. O
At O
the O
grocer's O
they O
discussed O
Hippolyte's O
illness; O
the O
shops O
did O
no O
business, O
and O
Madame O
Tuvache, O
the O
mayor's O
wife, O
did O
not O
stir O
from O
her O
window, O
such O
was O
her O
impatience O
to O
see O
the O
operator O
arrive. O
He O
came O
in O
his O
gig, O
which O
he O
drove O
himself. O
But O
the O
springs O
of O
the O
right O
side O
having O
at O
length O
given O
way O
beneath O
the O
weight O
of O
his O
corpulence, O
it O
happened O
that O
the O
carriage O
as O
it O
rolled O
along O
leaned O
over O
a O
little, O
and O
on O
the O
other O
cushion O
near O
him O
could O
be O
seen O
a O
large O
box O
covered O
in O
red O
sheep-leather, O
whose O
three O
brass O
clasps O
shone O
grandly. O
After O
he O
had O
entered O
like O
a O
whirlwind O
the O
porch O
of O
the O
"Lion O
d'Or," O
the O
doctor, O
shouting O
very O
loud, O
ordered O
them O
to O
unharness O
his O
horse. O
Then O
he O
went O
into O
the O
stable O
to O
see O
that O
he O
was O
eating O
his O
oats O
all O
right; O
for O
on O
arriving O
at O
a O
patient's O
he O
first O
of O
all O
looked O
after O
his O
mare O
and O
his O
gig. O
People O
even O
said O
about O
this-- O
"Ah! O
Monsieur O
Canivet's O
a O
character!" O
And O
he O
was O
the O
more O
esteemed O
for O
this O
imperturbable O
coolness. O
The O
universe O
to O
the O
last O
man O
might O
have O
died, O
and O
he O
would O
not O
have O
missed O
the O
smallest O
of O
his O
habits. O
Homais O
presented O
himself. O
"I O
count O
on O
you," O
said O
the O
doctor. O
"Are O
we O
ready? O
Come O
along!" O
But O
the O
druggist, O
turning O
red, O
confessed O
that O
he O
was O
too O
sensitive O
to O
assist O
at O
such O
an O
operation. O
"When O
one O
is O
a O
simple O
spectator," O
he O
said, O
"the O
imagination, O
you O
know, O
is O
impressed. O
And O
then O
I O
have O
such O
a O
nervous O
system!" O
"Pshaw!" O
interrupted O
Canivet; O
"on O
the O
contrary, O
you O
seem O
to O
me O
inclined O
to O
apoplexy. O
Besides, O
that O
doesn't O
astonish O
me, O
for O
you O
chemist O
fellows O
are O
always O
poking O
about O
your O
kitchens, O
which O
must O
end O
by O
spoiling O
your O
constitutions. O
Now O
just O
look O
at O
me. O
I O
get O
up O
every O
day O
at O
four O
o'clock; O
I O
shave O
with O
cold O
water O
(and O
am O
never O
cold). O
I O
don't O
wear O
flannels, O
and O
I O
never O
catch O
cold; O
my O
carcass O
is O
good O
enough! O
I O
live O
now O
in O
one O
way, O
now O
in O
another, O
like O
a O
philosopher, O
taking O
pot-luck; O
that O
is O
why O
I O
am O
not O
squeamish O
like O
you, O
and O
it O
is O
as O
indifferent O
to O
me O
to O
carve O
a O
Christian O
as O
the O
first O
fowl O
that O
turns O
up. O
Then, O
perhaps, O
you O
will O
say, O
habit! O
habit!" O
Then, O
without O
any O
consideration O
for O
Hippolyte, O
who O
was O
sweating O
with O
agony O
between O
his O
sheets, O
these O
gentlemen O
entered O
into O
a O
conversation, O
in O
which O
the O
druggist O
compared O
the O
coolness O
of O
a O
surgeon O
to O
that O
of O
a O
general; O
and O
this O
comparison O
was O
pleasing O
to O
Canivet, O
who O
launched O
out O
on O
the O
exigencies O
of O
his O
art. O
He O
looked O
upon, O
it O
as O
a O
sacred O
office, O
although O
the O
ordinary O
practitioners O
dishonoured O
it. O
At O
last, O
coming O
back O
to O
the O
patient, O
he O
examined O
the O
bandages O
brought O
by O
Homais, O
the O
same O
that O
had O
appeared O
for O
the O
club-foot, O
and O
asked O
for O
someone O
to O
hold O
the O
limb O
for O
him. O
Lestiboudois O
was O
sent O
for, O
and O
Monsieur O
Canivet O
having O
turned O
up O
his O
sleeves, O
passed O
into O
the O
billiard-room, O
while O
the O
druggist O
stayed O
with O
Artemise O
and O
the O
landlady, O
both O
whiter O
than O
their O
aprons, O
and O
with O
ears O
strained O
towards O
the O
door. O
Bovary O
during O
this O
time O
did O
not O
dare O
to O
stir O
from O
his O
house. O
He O
kept O
downstairs O
in O
the O
sitting-room O
by O
the O
side O
of O
the O
fireless O
chimney, O
his O
chin O
on O
his O
breast, O
his O
hands O
clasped, O
his O
eyes O
staring. O
"What O
a O
mishap!" O
he O
thought, O
"what O
a O
mishap!" O
Perhaps, O
after O
all, O
he O
had O
made O
some O
slip. O
He O
thought O
it O
over, O
but O
could O
hit O
upon O
nothing. O
But O
the O
most O
famous O
surgeons O
also O
made O
mistakes; O
and O
that O
is O
what O
no O
one O
would O
ever O
believe! O
People, O
on O
the O
contrary, O
would O
laugh, O
jeer! O
It O
would O
spread O
as O
far O
as O
Forges, O
as O
Neufchatel, O
as O
Rouen, O
everywhere! O
Who O
could O
say O
if O
his O
colleagues O
would O
not O
write O
against O
him. O
Polemics O
would O
ensue; O
he O
would O
have O
to O
answer O
in O
the O
papers. O
Hippolyte O
might O
even O
prosecute O
him. O
He O
saw O
himself O
dishonoured, O
ruined, O
lost; O
and O
his O
imagination, O
assailed O
by O
a O
world O
of O
hypotheses, O
tossed O
amongst O
them O
like O
an O
empty O
cask O
borne O
by O
the O
sea O
and O
floating O
upon O
the O
waves. O
Emma, O
opposite, O
watched O
him; O
she O
did O
not O
share O
his O
humiliation; O
she O
felt O
another-- O
that O
of O
having O
supposed O
such O
a O
man O
was O
worth O
anything. O
As O
if O
twenty O
times O
already O
she O
had O
not O
sufficiently O
perceived O
his O
mediocrity. O
Charles O
was O
walking O
up O
and O
down O
the O
room; O
his O
boots O
creaked O
on O
the O
floor. O
"Sit O
down," O
she O
said; O
"you O
fidget O
me." O
He O
sat O
down O
again. O
How O
was O
it O
that O
she-- O
she, O
who O
was O
so O
intelligent-- O
could O
have O
allowed O
herself O
to O
be O
deceived O
again? O
and O
through O
what O
deplorable O
madness O
had O
she O
thus O
ruined O
her O
life O
by O
continual O
sacrifices? O
She O
recalled O
all O
her O
instincts O
of O
luxury, O
all O
the O
privations O
of O
her O
soul, O
the O
sordidness O
of O
marriage, O
of O
the O
household, O
her O
dream O
sinking O
into O
the O
mire O
like O
wounded O
swallows; O
all O
that O
she O
had O
longed O
for, O
all O
that O
she O
had O
denied O
herself, O
all O
that O
she O
might O
have O
had! O
And O
for O
what? O
for O
what? O
In O
the O
midst O
of O
the O
silence O
that O
hung O
over O
the O
village O
a O
heart-rending O
cry O
rose O
on O
the O
air. O
Bovary O
turned O
white O
to O
fainting. O
She O
knit O
her O
brows O
with O
a O
nervous O
gesture, O
then O
went O
on. O
And O
it O
was O
for O
him, O
for O
this O
creature, O
for O
this O
man, O
who O
understood O
nothing, O
who O
felt O
nothing! O
For O
he O
was O
there O
quite O
quiet, O
not O
even O
suspecting O
that O
the O
ridicule O
of O
his O
name O
would O
henceforth O
sully O
hers O
as O
well O
as O
his. O
She O
had O
made O
efforts O
to O
love O
him, O
and O
she O
had O
repented O
with O
tears O
for O
having O
yielded O
to O
another! O
"But O
it O
was O
perhaps O
a O
valgus!" O
suddenly O
exclaimed O
Bovary, O
who O
was O
meditating. O
At O
the O
unexpected O
shock O
of O
this O
phrase O
falling O
on O
her O
thought O
like O
a O
leaden O
bullet O
on O
a O
silver O
plate, O
Emma, O
shuddering, O
raised O
her O
head O
in O
order O
to O
find O
out O
what O
he O
meant O
to O
say; O
and O
they O
looked O
at O
the O
other O
in O
silence, O
almost O
amazed O
to O
see O
each O
other, O
so O
far O
sundered O
were O
they O
by O
their O
inner O
thoughts. O
Charles O
gazed O
at O
her O
with O
the O
dull O
look O
of O
a O
drunken O
man, O
while O
he O
listened O
motionless O
to O
the O
last O
cries O
of O
the O
sufferer, O
that O
followed O
each O
other O
in O
long-drawn O
modulations, O
broken O
by O
sharp O
spasms O
like O
the O
far-off O
howling O
of O
some O
beast O
being O
slaughtered. O
Emma O
bit O
her O
wan O
lips, O
and O
rolling O
between O
her O
fingers O
a O
piece O
of O
coral O
that O
she O
had O
broken, O
fixed O
on O
Charles O
the O
burning O
glance O
of O
her O
eyes O
like O
two O
arrows O
of O
fire O
about O
to O
dart O
forth. O
Everything O
in O
him O
irritated O
her O
now; O
his O
face, O
his O
dress, O
what O
he O
did O
not O
say, O
his O
whole O
person, O
his O
existence, O
in O
fine. O
She O
repented O
of O
her O
past O
virtue O
as O
of O
a O
crime, O
and O
what O
still O
remained O
of O
it O
rumbled O
away O
beneath O
the O
furious O
blows O
of O
her O
pride. O
She O
revelled O
in O
all O
the O
evil O
ironies O
of O
triumphant O
adultery. O
The O
memory O
of O
her O
lover O
came O
back O
to O
her O
with O
dazzling O
attractions; O
she O
threw O
her O
whole O
soul O
into O
it, O
borne O
away O
towards O
this O
image O
with O
a O
fresh O
enthusiasm; O
and O
Charles O
seemed O
to O
her O
as O
much O
removed O
from O
her O
life, O
as O
absent O
forever, O
as O
impossible O
and O
annihilated, O
as O
if O
he O
had O
been O
about O
to O
die O
and O
were O
passing O
under O
her O
eyes. O
There O
was O
a O
sound O
of O
steps O
on O
the O
pavement. O
Charles O
looked O
up, O
and O
through O
the O
lowered O
blinds O
he O
saw O
at O
the O
corner O
of O
the O
market O
in O
the O
broad O
sunshine O
Dr. O
Canivet, O
who O
was O
wiping O
his O
brow O
with O
his O
handkerchief. O
Homais, O
behind O
him, O
was O
carrying O
a O
large O
red O
box O
in O
his O
hand, O
and O
both O
were O
going O
towards O
the O
chemist's. O
Then O
with O
a O
feeling O
of O
sudden O
tenderness O
and O
discouragement O
Charles O
turned O
to O
his O
wife O
saying O
to O
her-- O
"Oh, O
kiss O
me, O
my O
own!" O
"Leave O
me!" O
she O
said, O
red O
with O
anger. O
"What O
is O
the O
matter?" O
he O
asked, O
stupefied. O
"Be O
calm; O
compose O
yourself. O
You O
know O
well O
enough O
that O
I O
love O
you. O
Come!" O
"Enough!" O
she O
cried O
with O
a O
terrible O
look. O
And O
escaping O
from O
the O
room, O
Emma O
closed O
the O
door O
so O
violently O
that O
the O
barometer O
fell O
from O
the O
wall O
and O
smashed O
on O
the O
floor. O
Charles O
sank O
back O
into O
his O
arm-chair O
overwhelmed, O
trying O
to O
discover O
what O
could O
be O
wrong O
with O
her, O
fancying O
some O
nervous O
illness, O
weeping, O
and O
vaguely O
feeling O
something O
fatal O
and O
incomprehensible O
whirling O
round O
him. O
When O
Rodolphe O
came O
to O
the O
garden O
that O
evening, O
he O
found O
his O
mistress O
waiting O
for O
him O
at O
the O
foot O
of O
the O
steps O
on O
the O
lowest O
stair. O
They O
threw O
their O
arms O
round O
one O
another, O
and O
all O
their O
rancour O
melted O
like O
snow O
beneath O
the O
warmth O
of O
that O
kiss. O
CHAPTER O
TWELVE O
They O
began O
to O
love O
one O
another O
again. O
Often, O
even O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
day, O
Emma O
suddenly O
wrote O
to O
him, O
then O
from O
the O
window O
made O
a O
sign O
to O
Justin, O
who, O
taking O
his O
apron O
off, O
quickly O
ran O
to O
La O
Huchette. O
Rodolphe O
would O
come; O
she O
had O
sent O
for O
him O
to O
tell O
him O
that O
she O
was O
bored, O
that O
her O
husband O
was O
odious, O
her O
life O
frightful. O
"But O
what O
can O
I O
do?" O
he O
cried O
one O
day O
impatiently. O
"Ah! O
if O
you O
would O
-- O
" O
She O
was O
sitting O
on O
the O
floor O
between O
his O
knees, O
her O
hair O
loose, O
her O
look O
lost. O
"Why, O
what?" O
said O
Rodolphe. O
She O
sighed. O
"We O
would O
go O
and O
live O
elsewhere-- O
somewhere!" O
"You O
are O
really O
mad!" O
he O
said O
laughing. O
"How O
could O
that O
be O
possible?" O
She O
returned O
to O
the O
subject; O
he O
pretended O
not O
to O
understand, O
and O
turned O
the O
conversation. O
What O
he O
did O
not O
understand O
was O
all O
this O
worry O
about O
so O
simple O
an O
affair O
as O
love. O
She O
had O
a O
motive, O
a O
reason, O
and, O
as O
it O
were, O
a O
pendant O
to O
her O
affection. O
Her O
tenderness, O
in O
fact, O
grew O
each O
day O
with O
her O
repulsion O
to O
her O
husband. O
The O
more O
she O
gave O
up O
herself O
to O
the O
one, O
the O
more O
she O
loathed O
the O
other. O
Never O
had O
Charles O
seemed O
to O
her O
so O
disagreeable, O
to O
have O
such O
stodgy O
fingers, O
such O
vulgar O
ways, O
to O
be O
so O
dull O
as O
when O
they O
found O
themselves O
together O
after O
her O
meeting O
with O
Rodolphe. O
Then, O
while O
playing O
the O
spouse O
and O
virtue, O
she O
was O
burning O
at O
the O
thought O
of O
that O
head O
whose O
black O
hair O
fell O
in O
a O
curl O
over O
the O
sunburnt O
brow, O
of O
that O
form O
at O
once O
so O
strong O
and O
elegant, O
of O
that O
man, O
in O
a O
word, O
who O
had O
such O
experience O
in O
his O
reasoning, O
such O
passion O
in O
his O
desires. O
It O
was O
for O
him O
that O
she O
filed O
her O
nails O
with O
the O
care O
of O
a O
chaser, O
and O
that O
there O
was O
never O
enough O
cold-cream O
for O
her O
skin, O
nor O
of O
patchouli O
for O
her O
handkerchiefs. O
She O
loaded O
herself O
with O
bracelets, O
rings, O
and O
necklaces. O
When O
he O
was O
coming O
she O
filled O
the O
two O
large O
blue O
glass O
vases O
with O
roses, O
and O
prepared O
her O
room O
and O
her O
person O
like O
a O
courtesan O
expecting O
a O
prince. O
The O
servant O
had O
to O
be O
constantly O
washing O
linen, O
and O
all O
day O
Felicite O
did O
not O
stir O
from O
the O
kitchen, O
where O
little O
Justin, O
who O
often O
kept O
her O
company, O
watched O
her O
at O
work. O
With O
his O
elbows O
on O
the O
long O
board O
on O
which O
she O
was O
ironing, O
he O
greedily O
watched O
all O
these O
women's O
clothes O
spread O
about O
him, O
the O
dimity O
petticoats, O
the O
fichus, O
the O
collars, O
and O
the O
drawers O
with O
running O
strings, O
wide O
at O
the O
hips O
and O
growing O
narrower O
below. O
"What O
is O
that O
for?" O
asked O
the O
young O
fellow, O
passing O
his O
hand O
over O
the O
crinoline O
or O
the O
hooks O
and O
eyes. O
"Why, O
haven't O
you O
ever O
seen O
anything?" O
Felicite O
answered O
laughing. O
"As O
if O
your O
mistress, O
Madame O
Homais, O
didn't O
wear O
the O
same." O
"Oh, O
I O
daresay! O
Madame O
Homais!" O
And O
he O
added O
with O
a O
meditative O
air, O
"As O
if O
she O
were O
a O
lady O
like O
madame!" O
But O
Felicite O
grew O
impatient O
of O
seeing O
him O
hanging O
round O
her. O
She O
was O
six O
years O
older O
than O
he, O
and O
Theodore, O
Monsieur O
Guillaumin's O
servant, O
was O
beginning O
to O
pay O
court O
to O
her. O
"Let O
me O
alone," O
she O
said, O
moving O
her O
pot O
of O
starch. O
"You'd O
better O
be O
off O
and O
pound O
almonds; O
you O
are O
always O
dangling O
about O
women. O
Before O
you O
meddle O
with O
such O
things, O
bad O
boy, O
wait O
till O
you've O
got O
a O
beard O
to O
your O
chin." O
"Oh, O
don't O
be O
cross! O
I'll O
go O
and O
clean O
her O
boots." O
And O
he O
at O
once O
took O
down O
from O
the O
shelf O
Emma's O
boots, O
all O
coated O
with O
mud, O
the O
mud O
of O
the O
rendezvous, O
that O
crumbled O
into O
powder O
beneath O
his O
fingers, O
and O
that O
he O
watched O
as O
it O
gently O
rose O
in O
a O
ray O
of O
sunlight. O
"How O
afraid O
you O
are O
of O
spoiling O
them!" O
said O
the O
servant, O
who O
wasn't O
so O
particular O
when O
she O
cleaned O
them O
herself, O
because O
as O
soon O
as O
the O
stuff O
of O
the O
boots O
was O
no O
longer O
fresh O
madame O
handed O
them O
over O
to O
her. O
Emma O
had O
a O
number O
in O
her O
cupboard O
that O
she O
squandered O
one O
after O
the O
other, O
without O
Charles O
allowing O
himself O
the O
slightest O
observation. O
So O
also O
he O
disbursed O
three O
hundred O
francs O
for O
a O
wooden O
leg O
that O
she O
thought O
proper O
to O
make O
a O
present O
of O
to O
Hippolyte. O
Its O
top O
was O
covered O
with O
cork, O
and O
it O
had O
spring O
joints, O
a O
complicated O
mechanism, O
covered O
over O
by O
black O
trousers O
ending O
in O
a O
patent-leather O
boot. O
But O
Hippolyte, O
not O
daring O
to O
use O
such O
a O
handsome O
leg O
every O
day, O
begged O
Madame O
Bovary O
to O
get O
him O
another O
more O
convenient O
one. O
The O
doctor, O
of O
course, O
had O
again O
to O
defray O
the O
expense O
of O
this O
purchase. O
So O
little O
by O
little O
the O
stable-man O
took O
up O
his O
work O
again. O
One O
saw O
him O
running O
about O
the O
village O
as O
before, O
and O
when O
Charles O
heard O
from O
afar O
the O
sharp O
noise O
of O
the O
wooden O
leg, O
he O
at O
once O
went O
in O
another O
direction. O
It O
was O
Monsieur O
Lheureux, O
the O
shopkeeper, O
who O
had O
undertaken O
the O
order; O
this O
provided O
him O
with O
an O
excuse O
for O
visiting O
Emma. O
He O
chatted O
with O
her O
about O
the O
new O
goods O
from O
Paris, O
about O
a O
thousand O
feminine O
trifles, O
made O
himself O
very O
obliging, O
and O
never O
asked O
for O
his O
money. O
Emma O
yielded O
to O
this O
lazy O
mode O
of O
satisfying O
all O
her O
caprices. O
Thus O
she O
wanted O
to O
have O
a O
very O
handsome O
ridding-whip O
that O
was O
at O
an O
umbrella-maker's O
at O
Rouen O
to O
give O
to O
Rodolphe. O
The O
week O
after O
Monsieur O
Lheureux O
placed O
it O
on O
her O
table. O
But O
the O
next O
day O
he O
called O
on O
her O
with O
a O
bill O
for O
two O
hundred O
and O
seventy O
francs, O
not O
counting O
the O
centimes. O
Emma O
was O
much O
embarrassed; O
all O
the O
drawers O
of O
the O
writing-table O
were O
empty; O
they O
owed O
over O
a O
fortnight's O
wages O
to O
Lestiboudois, O
two O
quarters O
to O
the O
servant, O
for O
any O
quantity O
of O
other O
things, O
and O
Bovary O
was O
impatiently O
expecting O
Monsieur O
Derozeray's O
account, O
which O
he O
was O
in O
the O
habit O
of O
paying O
every O
year O
about O
Midsummer. O
She O
succeeded O
at O
first O
in O
putting O
off O
Lheureux. O
At O
last O
he O
lost O
patience; O
he O
was O
being O
sued; O
his O
capital O
was O
out, O
and O
unless O
he O
got O
some O
in O
he O
should O
be O
forced O
to O
take O
back O
all O
the O
goods O
she O
had O
received. O
"Oh, O
very O
well, O
take O
them!" O
said O
Emma. O
"I O
was O
only O
joking," O
he O
replied; O
"the O
only O
thing O
I O
regret O
is O
the O
whip. O
My O
word! O
I'll O
ask O
monsieur O
to O
return O
it O
to O
me." O
"No, O
no!" O
she O
said. O
"Ah! O
I've O
got O
you!" O
thought O
Lheureux. O
And, O
certain O
of O
his O
discovery, O
he O
went O
out O
repeating O
to O
himself O
in O
an O
undertone, O
and O
with O
his O
usual O
low O
whistle-- O
"Good! O
we O
shall O
see! O
we O
shall O
see!" O
She O
was O
thinking O
how O
to O
get O
out O
of O
this O
when O
the O
servant O
coming O
in O
put O
on O
the O
mantelpiece O
a O
small O
roll O
of O
blue O
paper O
"from O
Monsieur O
Derozeray's." O
Emma O
pounced O
upon O
and O
opened O
it. O
It O
contained O
fifteen O
napoleons; O
it O
was O
the O
account. O
She O
heard O
Charles O
on O
the O
stairs; O
threw O
the O
gold O
to O
the O
back O
of O
her O
drawer, O
and O
took O
out O
the O
key. O
Three O
days O
after O
Lheureux O
reappeared. O
"I O
have O
an O
arrangement O
to O
suggest O
to O
you," O
he O
said. O
"If, O
instead O
of O
the O
sum O
agreed O
on, O
you O
would O
take O
-- O
" O
"Here O
it O
is," O
she O
said O
placing O
fourteen O
napoleons O
in O
his O
hand. O
The O
tradesman O
was O
dumfounded. O
Then, O
to O
conceal O
his O
disappointment, O
he O
was O
profuse O
in O
apologies O
and O
proffers O
of O
service, O
all O
of O
which O
Emma O
declined; O
then O
she O
remained O
a O
few O
moments O
fingering O
in O
the O
pocket O
of O
her O
apron O
the O
two O
five-franc O
pieces O
that O
he O
had O
given O
her O
in O
change. O
She O
promised O
herself O
she O
would O
economise O
in O
order O
to O
pay O
back O
later O
on. O
"Pshaw!" O
she O
thought, O
"he O
won't O
think O
about O
it O
again." O
Besides O
the O
riding-whip O
with O
its O
silver-gilt O
handle, O
Rodolphe O
had O
received O
a O
seal O
with O
the O
motto O
Amor O
nel O
cor O
furthermore, O
a O
scarf O
for O
a O
muffler, O
and, O
finally, O
a O
cigar-case O
exactly O
like O
the O
Viscount's, O
that O
Charles O
had O
formerly O
picked O
up O
in O
the O
road, O
and O
that O
Emma O
had O
kept. O
These O
presents, O
however, O
humiliated O
him; O
he O
refused O
several; O
she O
insisted, O
and O
he O
ended O
by O
obeying, O
thinking O
her O
tyrannical O
and O
overexacting. O
A O
LOVING O
HEART. O
Then O
she O
had O
strange O
ideas. O
"When O
midnight O
strikes," O
she O
said, O
"you O
must O
think O
of O
me." O
And O
if O
he O
confessed O
that O
he O
had O
not O
thought O
of O
her, O
there O
were O
floods O
of O
reproaches O
that O
always O
ended O
with O
the O
eternal O
question-- O
"Do O
you O
love O
me?" O
"Why, O
of O
course O
I O
love O
you," O
he O
answered. O
"A O
great O
deal?" O
"Certainly!" O
"You O
haven't O
loved O
any O
others?" O
"Did O
you O
think O
you'd O
got O
a O
virgin?" O
he O
exclaimed O
laughing. O
Emma O
cried, O
and O
he O
tried O
to O
console O
her, O
adorning O
his O
protestations O
with O
puns. O
"Oh," O
she O
went O
on, O
"I O
love O
you! O
I O
love O
you O
so O
that O
I O
could O
not O
live O
without O
you, O
do O
you O
see? O
There O
are O
times O
when O
I O
long O
to O
see O
you O
again, O
when O
I O
am O
torn O
by O
all O
the O
anger O
of O
love. O
I O
ask O
myself, O
Where O
is O
he? O
Perhaps O
he O
is O
talking O
to O
other O
women. O
They O
smile O
upon O
him; O
he O
approaches. O
Oh O
no; O
no O
one O
else O
pleases O
you. O
There O
are O
some O
more O
beautiful, O
but O
I O
love O
you O
best. O
I O
know O
how O
to O
love O
best. O
I O
am O
your O
servant, O
your O
concubine! O
You O
are O
my O
king, O
my O
idol! O
You O
are O
good, O
you O
are O
beautiful, O
you O
are O
clever, O
you O
are O
strong!" O
He O
had O
so O
often O
heard O
these O
things O
said O
that O
they O
did O
not O
strike O
him O
as O
original. O
Emma O
was O
like O
all O
his O
mistresses; O
and O
the O
charm O
of O
novelty, O
gradually O
falling O
away O
like O
a O
garment, O
laid O
bare O
the O
eternal O
monotony O
of O
passion, O
that O
has O
always O
the O
same O
forms O
and O
the O
same O
language. O
He O
did O
not O
distinguish, O
this O
man O
of O
so O
much O
experience, O
the O
difference O
of O
sentiment O
beneath O
the O
sameness O
of O
expression. O
Because O
lips O
libertine O
and O
venal O
had O
murmured O
such O
words O
to O
him, O
he O
believed O
but O
little O
in O
the O
candour O
of O
hers; O
exaggerated O
speeches O
hiding O
mediocre O
affections O
must O
be O
discounted; O
as O
if O
the O
fullness O
of O
the O
soul O
did O
not O
sometimes O
overflow O
in O
the O
emptiest O
metaphors, O
since O
no O
one O
can O
ever O
give O
the O
exact O
measure O
of O
his O
needs, O
nor O
of O
his O
conceptions, O
nor O
of O
his O
sorrows; O
and O
since O
human O
speech O
is O
like O
a O
cracked O
tin O
kettle, O
on O
which O
we O
hammer O
out O
tunes O
to O
make O
bears O
dance O
when O
we O
long O
to O
move O
the O
stars. O
But O
with O
that O
superior O
critical O
judgment O
that O
belongs O
to O
him O
who, O
in O
no O
matter O
what O
circumstance, O
holds O
back, O
Rodolphe O
saw O
other O
delights O
to O
be O
got O
out O
of O
this O
love. O
He O
thought O
all O
modesty O
in O
the O
way. O
He O
treated O
her O
quite O
sans O
facon. O
He O
made O
of O
her O
something O
supple O
and O
corrupt. O
Hers O
was O
an O
idiotic O
sort O
of O
attachment, O
full O
of O
admiration O
for O
him, O
of O
voluptuousness O
for O
her, O
a O
beatitude O
that O
benumbed O
her; O
her O
soul O
sank O
into O
this O
drunkenness, O
shrivelled O
up, O
drowned O
in O
it, O
like O
Clarence O
in O
his O
butt O
of O
Malmsey. O
OFF-HANDEDLY. O
By O
the O
mere O
effect O
of O
her O
love O
Madame O
Bovary's O
manners O
changed. O
Her O
looks O
grew O
bolder, O
her O
speech O
more O
free; O
she O
even O
committed O
the O
impropriety O
of O
walking O
out O
with O
Monsieur O
Rodolphe, O
a O
cigarette O
in O
her O
mouth, O
"as O
if O
to O
defy O
the O
people." O
At O
last, O
those O
who O
still O
doubted O
doubted O
no O
longer O
when O
one O
day O
they O
saw O
her O
getting O
out O
of O
the O
"Hirondelle," O
her O
waist O
squeezed O
into O
a O
waistcoat O
like O
a O
man; O
and O
Madame O
Bovary O
senior, O
who, O
after O
a O
fearful O
scene O
with O
her O
husband, O
had O
taken O
refuge O
at O
her O
son's, O
was O
not O
the O
least O
scandalised O
of O
the O
women-folk. O
Many O
other O
things O
displeased O
her. O
First, O
Charles O
had O
not O
attended O
to O
her O
advice O
about O
the O
forbidding O
of O
novels; O
then O
the O
"ways O
of O
the O
house" O
annoyed O
her; O
she O
allowed O
herself O
to O
make O
some O
remarks, O
and O
there O
were O
quarrels, O
especially O
one O
on O
account O
of O
Felicite. O
Madame O
Bovary O
senior, O
the O
evening O
before, O
passing O
along O
the O
passage, O
had O
surprised O
her O
in O
company O
of O
a O
man O
-- O
a O
man O
with O
a O
brown O
collar, O
about O
forty O
years O
old, O
who, O
at O
the O
sound O
of O
her O
step, O
had O
quickly O
escaped O
through O
the O
kitchen. O
Then O
Emma O
began O
to O
laugh, O
but O
the O
good O
lady O
grew O
angry, O
declaring O
that O
unless O
morals O
were O
to O
be O
laughed O
at O
one O
ought O
to O
look O
after O
those O
of O
one's O
servants. O
"Where O
were O
you O
brought O
up?" O
asked O
the O
daughter-in-law, O
with O
so O
impertinent O
a O
look O
that O
Madame O
Bovary O
asked O
her O
if O
she O
were O
not O
perhaps O
defending O
her O
own O
case. O
"Leave O
the O
room!" O
said O
the O
young O
woman, O
springing O
up O
with O
a O
bound. O
"Emma! O
Mamma!" O
cried O
Charles, O
trying O
to O
reconcile O
them. O
But O
both O
had O
fled O
in O
their O
exasperation. O
Emma O
was O
stamping O
her O
feet O
as O
she O
repeated-- O
"Oh! O
what O
manners! O
What O
a O
peasant!" O
He O
ran O
to O
his O
mother; O
she O
was O
beside O
herself. O
She O
stammered O
"She O
is O
an O
insolent, O
giddy-headed O
thing, O
or O
perhaps O
worse!" O
And O
she O
was O
for O
leaving O
at O
once O
if O
the O
other O
did O
not O
apologise. O
So O
Charles O
went O
back O
again O
to O
his O
wife O
and O
implored O
her O
to O
give O
way; O
he O
knelt O
to O
her; O
she O
ended O
by O
saying-- O
"Very O
well! O
I'll O
go O
to O
her." O
And O
in O
fact O
she O
held O
out O
her O
hand O
to O
her O
mother-in-law O
with O
the O
dignity O
of O
a O
marchioness O
as O
she O
said-- O
"Excuse O
me, O
madame." O
Then, O
having O
gone O
up O
again O
to O
her O
room, O
she O
threw O
herself O
flat O
on O
her O
bed O
and O
cried O
there O
like O
a O
child, O
her O
face O
buried O
in O
the O
pillow. O
She O
and O
Rodolphe O
had O
agreed O
that O
in O
the O
event O
of O
anything O
extraordinary O
occurring, O
she O
should O
fasten O
a O
small O
piece O
of O
white O
paper O
to O
the O
blind, O
so O
that O
if O
by O
chance O
he O
happened O
to O
be O
in O
Yonville, O
he O
could O
hurry O
to O
the O
lane O
behind O
the O
house. O
Emma O
made O
the O
signal; O
she O
had O
been O
waiting O
three-quarters O
of O
an O
hour O
when O
she O
suddenly O
caught O
sight O
of O
Rodolphe O
at O
the O
corner O
of O
the O
market. O
She O
felt O
tempted O
to O
open O
the O
window O
and O
call O
him, O
but O
he O
had O
already O
disappeared. O
She O
fell O
back O
in O
despair. O
Soon, O
however, O
it O
seemed O
to O
her O
that O
someone O
was O
walking O
on O
the O
pavement. O
It O
was O
he, O
no O
doubt. O
She O
went O
downstairs, O
crossed O
the O
yard. O
He O
was O
there O
outside. O
She O
threw O
herself O
into O
his O
arms. O
"Do O
take O
care!" O
he O
said. O
"Ah! O
if O
you O
knew!" O
she O
replied. O
And O
she O
began O
telling O
him O
everything, O
hurriedly, O
disjointedly, O
exaggerating O
the O
facts, O
inventing O
many, O
and O
so O
prodigal O
of O
parentheses O
that O
he O
understood O
nothing O
of O
it. O
"Come, O
my O
poor O
angel, O
courage! O
Be O
comforted! O
be O
patient!" O
"But O
I O
have O
been O
patient; O
I O
have O
suffered O
for O
four O
years. O
A O
love O
like O
ours O
ought O
to O
show O
itself O
in O
the O
face O
of O
heaven. O
They O
torture O
me! O
I O
can O
bear O
it O
no O
longer! O
Save O
me!" O
She O
clung O
to O
Rodolphe. O
Her O
eyes, O
full O
of O
tears, O
flashed O
like O
flames O
beneath O
a O
wave; O
her O
breast O
heaved; O
he O
had O
never O
loved O
her O
so O
much, O
so O
that O
he O
lost O
his O
head O
and O
said O
"What O
is, O
it? O
What O
do O
you O
wish?" O
"Take O
me O
away," O
she O
cried, O
"carry O
me O
off! O
Oh, O
I O
pray O
you!" O
And O
she O
threw O
herself O
upon O
his O
mouth, O
as O
if O
to O
seize O
there O
the O
unexpected O
consent O
if O
breathed O
forth O
in O
a O
kiss. O
"But O
-- O
" O
Rodolphe O
resumed. O
"What?" O
"Your O
little O
girl!" O
She O
reflected O
a O
few O
moments, O
then O
replied-- O
"We O
will O
take O
her! O
It O
can't O
be O
helped!" O
"What O
a O
woman!" O
he O
said O
to O
himself, O
watching O
her O
as O
she O
went. O
For O
she O
had O
run O
into O
the O
garden. O
Someone O
was O
calling O
her. O
On O
the O
following O
days O
Madame O
Bovary O
senior O
was O
much O
surprised O
at O
the O
change O
in O
her O
daughter-in-law. O
Emma, O
in O
fact, O
was O
showing O
herself O
more O
docile, O
and O
even O
carried O
her O
deference O
so O
far O
as O
to O
ask O
for O
a O
recipe O
for O
pickling O
gherkins. O
Was O
it O
the O
better O
to O
deceive O
them O
both? O
Or O
did O
she O
wish O
by O
a O
sort O
of O
voluptuous O
stoicism O
to O
feel O
the O
more O
profoundly O
the O
bitterness O
of O
the O
things O
she O
was O
about O
to O
leave? O
But O
she O
paid O
no O
heed O
to O
them; O
on O
the O
contrary, O
she O
lived O
as O
lost O
in O
the O
anticipated O
delight O
of O
her O
coming O
happiness. O
It O
was O
an O
eternal O
subject O
for O
conversation O
with O
Rodolphe. O
She O
leant O
on O
his O
shoulder O
murmuring-- O
"Ah! O
when O
we O
are O
in O
the O
mail-coach! O
Do O
you O
think O
about O
it? O
Can O
it O
be? O
It O
seems O
to O
me O
that O
the O
moment O
I O
feel O
the O
carriage O
start, O
it O
will O
be O
as O
if O
we O
were O
rising O
in O
a O
balloon, O
as O
if O
we O
were O
setting O
out O
for O
the O
clouds. O
Do O
you O
know O
that O
I O
count O
the O
hours? O
And O
you?" O
Never O
had O
Madame O
Bovary O
been O
so O
beautiful O
as O
at O
this O
period; O
she O
had O
that O
indefinable O
beauty O
that O
results O
from O
joy, O
from O
enthusiasm, O
from O
success, O
and O
that O
is O
only O
the O
harmony O
of O
temperament O
with O
circumstances. O
Her O
desires, O
her O
sorrows, O
the O
experience O
of O
pleasure, O
and O
her O
ever-young O
illusions, O
that O
had, O
as O
soil O
and O
rain O
and O
winds O
and O
the O
sun O
make O
flowers O
grow, O
gradually O
developed O
her, O
and O
she O
at O
length O
blossomed O
forth O
in O
all O
the O
plenitude O
of O
her O
nature. O
Her O
eyelids O
seemed O
chiselled O
expressly O
for O
her O
long O
amorous O
looks O
in O
which O
the O
pupil O
disappeared, O
while O
a O
strong O
inspiration O
expanded O
her O
delicate O
nostrils O
and O
raised O
the O
fleshy O
corner O
of O
her O
lips, O
shaded O
in O
the O
light O
by O
a O
little O
black O
down. O
One O
would O
have O
thought O
that O
an O
artist O
apt O
in O
conception O
had O
arranged O
the O
curls O
of O
hair O
upon O
her O
neck; O
they O
fell O
in O
a O
thick O
mass, O
negligently, O
and O
with O
the O
changing O
chances O
of O
their O
adultery, O
that O
unbound O
them O
every O
day. O
Her O
voice O
now O
took O
more O
mellow O
infections, O
her O
figure O
also; O
something O
subtle O
and O
penetrating O
escaped O
even O
from O
the O
folds O
of O
her O
gown O
and O
from O
the O
line O
of O
her O
foot. O
Charles, O
as O
when O
they O
were O
first O
married, O
thought O
her O
delicious O
and O
quite O
irresistible. O
When O
he O
came O
home O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
night, O
he O
did O
not O
dare O
to O
wake O
her. O
The O
porcelain O
night-light O
threw O
a O
round O
trembling O
gleam O
upon O
the O
ceiling, O
and O
the O
drawn O
curtains O
of O
the O
little O
cot O
formed O
as O
it O
were O
a O
white O
hut O
standing O
out O
in O
the O
shade, O
and O
by O
the O
bedside O
Charles O
looked O
at O
them. O
He O
seemed O
to O
hear O
the O
light O
breathing O
of O
his O
child. O
She O
would O
grow O
big O
now; O
every O
season O
would O
bring O
rapid O
progress. O
He O
already O
saw O
her O
coming O
from O
school O
as O
the O
day O
drew O
in, O
laughing, O
with O
ink-stains O
on O
her O
jacket, O
and O
carrying O
her O
basket O
on O
her O
arm. O
Then O
she O
would O
have O
to O
be O
sent O
to O
the O
boarding-school; O
that O
would O
cost O
much; O
how O
was O
it O
to O
be O
done? O
Then O
he O
reflected. O
He O
thought O
of O
hiring O
a O
small O
farm O
in O
the O
neighbourhood, O
that O
he O
would O
superintend O
every O
morning O
on O
his O
way O
to O
his O
patients. O
He O
would O
save O
up O
what O
he O
brought O
in; O
he O
would O
put O
it O
in O
the O
savings-bank. O
Then O
he O
would O
buy O
shares O
somewhere, O
no O
matter O
where; O
besides, O
his O
practice O
would O
increase; O
he O
counted O
upon O
that, O
for O
he O
wanted O
Berthe O
to O
be O
well-educated, O
to O
be O
accomplished, O
to O
learn O
to O
play O
the O
piano. O
Ah! O
how O
pretty O
she O
would O
be O
later O
on O
when O
she O
was O
fifteen, O
when, O
resembling O
her O
mother, O
she O
would, O
like O
her, O
wear O
large O
straw O
hats O
in O
the O
summer-time; O
from O
a O
distance O
they O
would O
be O
taken O
for O
two O
sisters. O
He O
pictured O
her O
to O
himself O
working O
in O
the O
evening O
by O
their O
side O
beneath O
the O
light O
of O
the O
lamp; O
she O
would O
embroider O
him O
slippers; O
she O
would O
look O
after O
the O
house; O
she O
would O
fill O
all O
the O
home O
with O
her O
charm O
and O
her O
gaiety. O
At O
last, O
they O
would O
think O
of O
her O
marriage; O
they O
would O
find O
her O
some O
good O
young O
fellow O
with O
a O
steady O
business; O
he O
would O
make O
her O
happy; O
this O
would O
last O
for O
ever. O
Emma O
was O
not O
asleep; O
she O
pretended O
to O
be; O
and O
while O
he O
dozed O
off O
by O
her O
side O
she O
awakened O
to O
other O
dreams. O
To O
the O
gallop O
of O
four O
horses O
she O
was O
carried O
away O
for O
a O
week O
towards O
a O
new O
land, O
whence O
they O
would O
return O
no O
more. O
They O
went O
on O
and O
on, O
their O
arms O
entwined, O
without O
a O
word. O
Often O
from O
the O
top O
of O
a O
mountain O
there O
suddenly O
glimpsed O
some O
splendid O
city O
with O
domes, O
and O
bridges, O
and O
ships, O
forests O
of O
citron O
trees, O
and O
cathedrals O
of O
white O
marble, O
on O
whose O
pointed O
steeples O
were O
storks' O
nests. O
They O
went O
at O
a O
walking-pace O
because O
of O
the O
great O
flag-stones, O
and O
on O
the O
ground O
there O
were O
bouquets O
of O
flowers, O
offered O
you O
by O
women O
dressed O
in O
red O
bodices. O
They O
heard O
the O
chiming O
of O
bells, O
the O
neighing O
of O
mules, O
together O
with O
the O
murmur O
of O
guitars O
and O
the O
noise O
of O
fountains, O
whose O
rising O
spray O
refreshed O
heaps O
of O
fruit O
arranged O
like O
a O
pyramid O
at O
the O
foot O
of O
pale O
statues O
that O
smiled O
beneath O
playing O
waters. O
And O
then, O
one O
night O
they O
came O
to O
a O
fishing O
village, O
where O
brown O
nets O
were O
drying O
in O
the O
wind O
along O
the O
cliffs O
and O
in O
front O
of O
the O
huts. O
It O
was O
there O
that O
they O
would O
stay; O
they O
would O
live O
in O
a O
low, O
flat-roofed O
house, O
shaded O
by O
a O
palm-tree, O
in O
the O
heart O
of O
a O
gulf, O
by O
the O
sea. O
They O
would O
row O
in O
gondolas, O
swing O
in O
hammocks, O
and O
their O
existence O
would O
be O
easy O
and O
large O
as O
their O
silk O
gowns, O
warm O
and O
star-spangled O
as O
the O
nights O
they O
would O
contemplate. O
However, O
in O
the O
immensity O
of O
this O
future O
that O
she O
conjured O
up, O
nothing O
special O
stood O
forth; O
the O
days, O
all O
magnificent, O
resembled O
each O
other O
like O
waves; O
and O
it O
swayed O
in O
the O
horizon, O
infinite, O
harmonised, O
azure, O
and O
bathed O
in O
sunshine. O
But O
the O
child O
began O
to O
cough O
in O
her O
cot O
or O
Bovary O
snored O
more O
loudly, O
and O
Emma O
did O
not O
fall O
asleep O
till O
morning, O
when O
the O
dawn O
whitened O
the O
windows, O
and O
when O
little O
Justin O
was O
already O
in O
the O
square O
taking O
down O
the O
shutters O
of O
the O
chemist's O
shop. O
She O
had O
sent O
for O
Monsieur O
Lheureux, O
and O
had O
said O
to O
him-- O
"I O
want O
a O
cloak O
-- O
a O
large O
lined O
cloak O
with O
a O
deep O
collar." O
"You O
are O
going O
on O
a O
journey?" O
he O
asked. O
"No; O
but-- O
never O
mind. O
I O
may O
count O
on O
you, O
may O
I O
not, O
and O
quickly?" O
He O
bowed. O
"Besides, O
I O
shall O
want," O
she O
went O
on, O
"a O
trunk-- O
not O
too O
heavy-- O
handy." O
"Yes, O
yes, O
I O
understand. O
About O
three O
feet O
by O
a O
foot O
and O
a O
half, O
as O
they O
are O
being O
made O
just O
now." O
"And O
a O
travelling O
bag." O
"Decidedly," O
thought O
Lheureux, O
"there's O
a O
row O
on O
here." O
"And," O
said O
Madame O
Bovary, O
taking O
her O
watch O
from O
her O
belt, O
"take O
this; O
you O
can O
pay O
yourself O
out O
of O
it." O
But O
the O
tradesman O
cried O
out O
that O
she O
was O
wrong; O
they O
knew O
one O
another; O
did O
he O
doubt O
her? O
What O
childishness! O
She O
insisted, O
however, O
on O
his O
taking O
at O
least O
the O
chain, O
and O
Lheureux O
had O
already O
put O
it O
in O
his O
pocket O
and O
was O
going, O
when O
she O
called O
him O
back. O
"You O
will O
leave O
everything O
at O
your O
place. O
As O
to O
the O
cloak"-- O
she O
seemed O
to O
be O
reflecting-- O
"do O
not O
bring O
it O
either; O
you O
can O
give O
me O
the O
maker's O
address, O
and O
tell O
him O
to O
have O
it O
ready O
for O
me." O
It O
was O
the O
next O
month O
that O
they O
were O
to O
run O
away. O
She O
was O
to O
leave O
Yonville O
as O
if O
she O
was O
going O
on O
some O
business O
to O
Rouen. O
Rodolphe O
would O
have O
booked O
the O
seats, O
procured O
the O
passports, O
and O
even O
have O
written O
to O
Paris O
in O
order O
to O
have O
the O
whole O
mail-coach O
reserved O
for O
them O
as O
far O
as O
Marseilles, O
where O
they O
would O
buy O
a O
carriage, O
and O
go O
on O
thence O
without O
stopping O
to O
Genoa. O
She O
would O
take O
care O
to O
send O
her O
luggage O
to O
Lheureux O
whence O
it O
would O
be O
taken O
direct O
to O
the O
"Hirondelle," O
so O
that O
no O
one O
would O
have O
any O
suspicion. O
And O
in O
all O
this O
there O
never O
was O
any O
allusion O
to O
the O
child. O
Rodolphe O
avoided O
speaking O
of O
her; O
perhaps O
he O
no O
longer O
thought O
about O
it. O
He O
wished O
to O
have O
two O
more O
weeks O
before O
him O
to O
arrange O
some O
affairs; O
then O
at O
the O
end O
of O
a O
week O
he O
wanted O
two O
more; O
then O
he O
said O
he O
was O
ill; O
next O
he O
went O
on O
a O
journey. O
The O
month O
of O
August O
passed, O
and, O
after O
all O
these O
delays, O
they O
decided O
that O
it O
was O
to O
be O
irrevocably O
fixed O
forDONEDET76214th O
September O
-- O
a O
Monday. O
At O
length O
the O
Saturday O
before O
arrived. O
Rodolphe O
came O
in O
the O
evening O
earlier O
than O
usual. O
"Everything O
is O
ready?" O
she O
asked O
him. O
"Yes." O
Then O
they O
walked O
round O
a O
garden-bed, O
and O
went O
to O
sit O
down O
near O
the O
terrace O
on O
the O
kerb-stone O
of O
the O
wall. O
"You O
are O
sad," O
said O
Emma. O
"No; O
why?" O
And O
yet O
he O
looked O
at O
her O
strangely O
in O
a O
tender O
fashion. O
"It O
is O
because O
you O
are O
going O
away?" O
she O
went O
on; O
"because O
you O
are O
leaving O
what O
is O
dear O
to O
you-- O
your O
life? O
Ah! O
I O
understand. O
I O
have O
nothing O
in O
the O
world! O
you O
are O
all O
to O
me; O
so O
shall O
I O
be O
to O
you. O
I O
will O
be O
your O
people, O
your O
country; O
I O
will O
tend, O
I O
will O
love O
you!" O
"How O
sweet O
you O
are!" O
he O
said, O
seizing O
her O
in O
his O
arms. O
"Really!" O
she O
said O
with O
a O
voluptuous O
laugh. O
"Do O
you O
love O
me? O
Swear O
it O
then!" O
"Do O
I O
love O
you-- O
love O
you? O
I O
adore O
you, O
my O
love." O
The O
moon, O
full O
and O
purple-coloured, O
was O
rising O
right O
out O
of O
the O
earth O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
meadow. O
She O
rose O
quickly O
between O
the O
branches O
of O
the O
poplars, O
that O
hid O
her O
here O
and O
there O
like O
a O
black O
curtain O
pierced O
with O
holes. O
Then O
she O
appeared O
dazzling O
with O
whiteness O
in O
the O
empty O
heavens O
that O
she O
lit O
up, O
and O
now O
sailing O
more O
slowly O
along, O
let O
fall O
upon O
the O
river O
a O
great O
stain O
that O
broke O
up O
into O
an O
infinity O
of O
stars; O
and O
the O
silver O
sheen O
seemed O
to O
writhe O
through O
the O
very O
depths O
like O
a O
heedless O
serpent O
covered O
with O
luminous O
scales; O
it O
also O
resembled O
some O
monster O
candelabra O
all O
along O
which O
sparkled O
drops O
of O
diamonds O
running O
together. O
The O
soft O
night O
was O
about O
them; O
masses O
of O
shadow O
filled O
the O
branches. O
Emma, O
her O
eyes O
half O
closed, O
breathed O
in O
with O
deep O
sighs O
the O
fresh O
wind O
that O
was O
blowing. O
They O
did O
not O
speak, O
lost O
as O
they O
were O
in O
the O
rush O
of O
their O
reverie. O
The O
tenderness O
of O
the O
old O
days O
came O
back O
to O
their O
hearts, O
full O
and O
silent O
as O
the O
flowing O
river, O
with O
the O
softness O
of O
the O
perfume O
of O
the O
syringas, O
and O
threw O
across O
their O
memories O
shadows O
more O
immense O
and O
more O
sombre O
than O
those O
of O
the O
still O
willows O
that O
lengthened O
out O
over O
the O
grass. O
Often O
some O
night-animal, O
hedgehog O
or O
weasel, O
setting O
out O
on O
the O
hunt, O
disturbed O
the O
lovers, O
or O
sometimes O
they O
heard O
a O
ripe O
peach O
falling O
all O
alone O
from O
the O
espalier. O
"Ah! O
what O
a O
lovely O
night!" O
said O
Rodolphe. O
"We O
shall O
have O
others," O
replied O
Emma; O
and, O
as O
if O
speaking O
to O
herself: O
"Yet, O
it O
will O
be O
good O
to O
travel. O
And O
yet, O
why O
should O
my O
heart O
be O
so O
heavy? O
Is O
it O
dread O
of O
the O
unknown? O
The O
effect O
of O
habits O
left? O
Or O
rather O
-- O
? O
No; O
it O
is O
the O
excess O
of O
happiness. O
How O
weak O
I O
am, O
am O
I O
not? O
Forgive O
me!" O
"There O
is O
still O
time!" O
he O
cried. O
"Reflect! O
perhaps O
you O
may O
repent!" O
"Never!" O
she O
cried O
impetuously. O
And O
coming O
closer O
to O
him: O
"What O
ill O
could O
come O
to O
me? O
There O
is O
no O
desert, O
no O
precipice, O
no O
ocean O
I O
would O
not O
traverse O
with O
you. O
The O
longer O
we O
live O
together O
the O
more O
it O
will O
be O
like O
an O
embrace, O
every O
day O
closer, O
more O
heart O
to O
heart. O
There O
will O
be O
nothing O
to O
trouble O
us, O
no O
cares, O
no O
obstacle. O
We O
shall O
be O
alone, O
all O
to O
ourselves O
eternally. O
Oh, O
speak! O
Answer O
me!" O
At O
regular O
intervals O
he O
answered, O
"Yes-- O
Yes O
-- O
" O
She O
had O
passed O
her O
hands O
through O
his O
hair, O
and O
she O
repeated O
in O
a O
childlike O
voice, O
despite O
the O
big O
tears O
which O
were O
falling, O
"Rodolphe! O
Rodolphe! O
Ah! O
Rodolphe! O
dear O
little O
Rodolphe!" O
Midnight O
struck. O
"Midnight!" O
said O
she. O
"Come, O
it O
is O
to-morrow. O
One O
day O
more!" O
He O
rose O
to O
go; O
and O
as O
if O
the O
movement O
he O
made O
had O
been O
the O
signal O
for O
their O
flight, O
Emma O
said, O
suddenly O
assuming O
a O
gay O
air-- O
"You O
have O
the O
passports?" O
"Yes." O
"You O
are O
forgetting O
nothing?" O
"No." O
"Are O
you O
sure?" O
"Certainly." O
"It O
is O
at O
the O
Hotel O
de O
Provence, O
is O
it O
not, O
that O
you O
will O
wait O
for O
me O
at O
midday?" O
He O
nodded. O
"Till O
to-morrow O
then!" O
said O
Emma O
in O
a O
last O
caress; O
and O
she O
watched O
him O
go. O
He O
did O
not O
turn O
round. O
She O
ran O
after O
him, O
and, O
leaning O
over O
the O
water's O
edge O
between O
the O
bulrushes-- O
"To-morrow!" O
she O
cried. O
He O
was O
already O
on O
the O
other O
side O
of O
the O
river O
and O
walking O
fast O
across O
the O
meadow. O
After O
a O
few O
moments O
Rodolphe O
stopped; O
and O
when O
he O
saw O
her O
with O
her O
white O
gown O
gradually O
fade O
away O
in O
the O
shade O
like O
a O
ghost, O
he O
was O
seized O
with O
such O
a O
beating O
of O
the O
heart O
that O
he O
leant O
against O
a O
tree O
lest O
he O
should O
fall. O
"What O
an O
imbecile O
I O
am!" O
he O
said O
with O
a O
fearful O
oath. O
"No O
matter! O
She O
was O
a O
pretty O
mistress!" O
And O
immediately O
Emma's O
beauty, O
with O
all O
the O
pleasures O
of O
their O
love, O
came O
back O
to O
him. O
For O
a O
moment O
he O
softened; O
then O
he O
rebelled O
against O
her. O
"For, O
after O
all," O
he O
exclaimed, O
gesticulating, O
"I O
can't O
exile O
myself-- O
have O
a O
child O
on O
my O
hands." O
He O
was O
saying O
these O
things O
to O
give O
himself O
firmness. O
"And O
besides, O
the O
worry, O
the O
expense! O
Ah! O
no, O
no, O
no, O
no! O
a O
thousand O
times O
no! O
That O
would O
be O
too O
stupid." O
CHAPTER O
THIRTEEN O
No O
sooner O
was O
Rodolphe O
at O
home O
than O
he O
sat O
down O
quickly O
at O
his O
bureau O
under O
the O
stag's O
head O
that O
hung O
as O
a O
trophy O
on O
the O
wall. O
But O
when O
he O
had O
the O
pen O
between O
his O
fingers, O
he O
could O
think O
of O
nothing, O
so O
that, O
resting O
on O
his O
elbows, O
he O
began O
to O
reflect. O
Emma O
seemed O
to O
him O
to O
have O
receded O
into O
a O
far-off O
past, O
as O
if O
the O
resolution O
he O
had O
taken O
had O
suddenly O
placed O
a O
distance O
between O
them. O
To O
get O
back O
something O
of O
her, O
he O
fetched O
from O
the O
cupboard O
at O
the O
bedside O
an O
old O
Rheims O
biscuit-box, O
in O
which O
he O
usually O
kept O
his O
letters O
from O
women, O
and O
from O
it O
came O
an O
odour O
of O
dry O
dust O
and O
withered O
roses. O
First O
he O
saw O
a O
handkerchief O
with O
pale O
little O
spots. O
It O
was O
a O
handkerchief O
of O
hers. O
Once O
when O
they O
were O
walking O
her O
nose O
had O
bled; O
he O
had O
forgotten O
it. O
Near O
it, O
chipped O
at O
all O
the O
corners, O
was O
a O
miniature O
given O
him O
by O
Emma: O
her O
toilette O
seemed O
to O
him O
pretentious, O
and O
her O
languishing O
look O
in O
the O
worst O
possible O
taste. O
Then, O
from O
looking O
at O
this O
image O
and O
recalling O
the O
memory O
of O
its O
original, O
Emma's O
features O
little O
by O
little O
grew O
confused O
in O
his O
remembrance, O
as O
if O
the O
living O
and O
the O
painted O
face, O
rubbing O
one O
against O
the O
other, O
had O
effaced O
each O
other. O
Finally, O
he O
read O
some O
of O
her O
letters; O
they O
were O
full O
of O
explanations O
relating O
to O
their O
journey, O
short, O
technical, O
and O
urgent, O
like O
business O
notes. O
He O
wanted O
to O
see O
the O
long O
ones O
again, O
those O
of O
old O
times. O
In O
order O
to O
find O
them O
at O
the O
bottom O
of O
the O
box, O
Rodolphe O
disturbed O
all O
the O
others, O
and O
mechanically O
began O
rummaging O
amidst O
this O
mass O
of O
papers O
and O
things, O
finding O
pell-mell O
bouquets, O
garters, O
a O
black O
mask, O
pins, O
and O
hair-- O
hair! O
dark O
and O
fair, O
some O
even, O
catching O
in O
the O
hinges O
of O
the O
box, O
broke O
when O
it O
was O
opened. O
Thus O
dallying O
with O
his O
souvenirs, O
he O
examined O
the O
writing O
and O
the O
style O
of O
the O
letters, O
as O
varied O
as O
their O
orthography. O
They O
were O
tender O
or O
jovial, O
facetious, O
melancholy; O
there O
were O
some O
that O
asked O
for O
love, O
others O
that O
asked O
for O
money. O
A O
word O
recalled O
faces O
to O
him, O
certain O
gestures, O
the O
sound O
of O
a O
voice; O
sometimes, O
however, O
he O
remembered O
nothing O
at O
all. O
In O
fact, O
these O
women, O
rushing O
at O
once O
into O
his O
thoughts, O
cramped O
each O
other O
and O
lessened, O
as O
reduced O
to O
a O
uniform O
level O
of O
love O
that O
equalised O
them O
all. O
So O
taking O
handfuls O
of O
the O
mixed-up O
letters, O
he O
amused O
himself O
for O
some O
moments O
with O
letting O
them O
fall O
in O
cascades O
from O
his O
right O
into O
his O
left O
hand. O
At O
last, O
bored O
and O
weary, O
Rodolphe O
took O
back O
the O
box O
to O
the O
cupboard, O
saying O
to O
himself, O
"What O
a O
lot O
of O
rubbish!" O
Which O
summed O
up O
his O
opinion; O
for O
pleasures, O
like O
schoolboys O
in O
a O
school O
courtyard, O
had O
so O
trampled O
upon O
his O
heart O
that O
no O
green O
thing O
grew O
there, O
and O
that O
which O
passed O
through O
it, O
more O
heedless O
than O
children, O
did O
not O
even, O
like O
them, O
leave O
a O
name O
carved O
upon O
the O
wall. O
"Come," O
said O
he, O
"let's O
begin." O
HE O
WROTE-- O
"Courage, O
Emma! O
courage! O
I O
would O
not O
bring O
misery O
into O
your O
life." O
"After O
all, O
that's O
true," O
thought O
Rodolphe. O
"I O
am O
acting O
in O
her O
interest; O
I O
am O
honest." O
"Have O
you O
carefully O
weighed O
your O
resolution? O
Do O
you O
know O
to O
what O
an O
abyss O
I O
was O
dragging O
you, O
poor O
angel? O
No, O
you O
do O
not, O
do O
you? O
You O
were O
coming O
confident O
and O
fearless, O
believing O
in O
happiness O
in O
the O
future. O
Ah! O
unhappy O
that O
we O
are-- O
insensate!" O
Rodolphe O
stopped O
here O
to O
think O
of O
some O
good O
excuse. O
"If O
I O
told O
her O
all O
my O
fortune O
is O
lost? O
No! O
Besides, O
that O
would O
stop O
nothing. O
It O
would O
all O
have O
to O
be O
begun O
over O
again O
later O
on. O
As O
if O
one O
could O
make O
women O
like O
that O
listen O
to O
reason!" O
He O
reflected, O
then O
went O
on-- O
"I O
shall O
not O
forget O
you, O
oh O
believe O
it; O
and O
I O
shall O
ever O
have O
a O
profound O
devotion O
for O
you; O
but O
some O
day, O
sooner O
or O
later, O
this O
ardour O
(such O
is O
the O
fate O
of O
human O
things) O
would O
have O
grown O
less, O
no O
doubt. O
Lassitude O
would O
have O
come O
to O
us, O
and O
who O
knows O
if O
I O
should O
not O
even O
have O
had O
the O
atrocious O
pain O
of O
witnessing O
your O
remorse, O
of O
sharing O
it O
myself, O
since O
I O
should O
have O
been O
its O
cause? O
The O
mere O
idea O
of O
the O
grief O
that O
would O
come O
to O
you O
tortures O
me, O
Emma. O
Forget O
me! O
Why O
did O
I O
ever O
know O
you? O
Why O
were O
you O
so O
beautiful? O
Is O
it O
my O
fault? O
O O
my O
God! O
No, O
no! O
Accuse O
only O
fate." O
"That's O
a O
word O
that O
always O
tells," O
he O
said O
to O
himself. O
"Ah, O
if O
you O
had O
been O
one O
of O
those O
frivolous O
women O
that O
one O
sees, O
certainly O
I O
might, O
through O
egotism, O
have O
tried O
an O
experiment, O
in O
that O
case O
without O
danger O
for O
you. O
But O
that O
delicious O
exaltation, O
at O
once O
your O
charm O
and O
your O
torment, O
has O
prevented O
you O
from O
understanding, O
adorable O
woman O
that O
you O
are, O
the O
falseness O
of O
our O
future O
position. O
Nor O
had O
I O
reflected O
upon O
this O
at O
first, O
and O
I O
rested O
in O
the O
shade O
of O
that O
ideal O
happiness O
as O
beneath O
that O
of O
the O
manchineel O
tree, O
without O
foreseeing O
the O
consequences." O
"Perhaps O
she'll O
think O
I'm O
giving O
it O
up O
from O
avarice. O
Ah, O
well! O
so O
much O
the O
worse; O
it O
must O
be O
stopped!" O
"The O
world O
is O
cruel, O
Emma. O
Wherever O
we O
might O
have O
gone, O
it O
would O
have O
persecuted O
us. O
You O
would O
have O
had O
to O
put O
up O
with O
indiscreet O
questions, O
calumny, O
contempt, O
insult O
perhaps. O
Insult O
to O
you! O
Oh! O
And O
I, O
who O
would O
place O
you O
on O
a O
throne! O
I O
who O
bear O
with O
me O
your O
memory O
as O
a O
talisman! O
For O
I O
am O
going O
to O
punish O
myself O
by O
exile O
for O
all O
the O
ill O
I O
have O
done O
you. O
I O
am O
going O
away. O
Whither O
I O
know O
not. O
I O
am O
mad. O
Adieu! O
Be O
good O
always. O
Preserve O
the O
memory O
of O
the O
unfortunate O
who O
has O
lost O
you. O
Teach O
my O
name O
to O
your O
child; O
let O
her O
repeat O
it O
in O
her O
prayers." O
The O
wicks O
of O
the O
candles O
flickered. O
Rodolphe O
got O
up O
to, O
shut O
the O
window, O
and O
when O
he O
had O
sat O
down O
again-- O
"I O
think O
it's O
all O
right. O
Ah! O
and O
this O
for O
fear O
she O
should O
come O
and O
hunt O
me O
up." O
"I O
shall O
be O
far O
away O
when O
you O
read O
these O
sad O
lines, O
for O
I O
have O
wished O
to O
flee O
as O
quickly O
as O
possible O
to O
shun O
the O
temptation O
of O
seeing O
you O
again. O
No O
weakness! O
I O
shall O
return, O
and O
perhaps O
later O
on O
we O
shall O
talk O
together O
very O
coldly O
of O
our O
old O
love. O
Adieu!" O
And O
there O
was O
a O
last O
"adieu" O
divided O
into O
two O
words! O
"A O
Dieu!" O
which O
he O
thought O
in O
very O
excellent O
taste. O
"Now O
how O
am O
I O
to O
sign?" O
he O
said O
to O
himself. O
"'Yours O
devotedly?' O
No! O
'Your O
friend?' O
Yes, O
that's O
it." O
"Your O
friend." O
He O
re-read O
his O
letter. O
He O
considered O
it O
very O
good. O
"Poor O
little O
woman!" O
he O
thought O
with O
emotion. O
"She'll O
think O
me O
harder O
than O
a O
rock. O
There O
ought O
to O
have O
been O
some O
tears O
on O
this; O
but O
I O
can't O
cry; O
it O
isn't O
my O
fault." O
Then, O
having O
emptied O
some O
water O
into O
a O
glass, O
Rodolphe O
dipped O
his O
finger O
into O
it, O
and O
let O
a O
big O
drop O
fall O
on O
the O
paper, O
that O
made O
a O
pale O
stain O
on O
the O
ink. O
Then O
looking O
for O
a O
seal, O
he O
came O
upon O
the O
one O
"Amor O
nel O
cor." O
"That O
doesn't O
at O
all O
fit O
in O
with O
the O
circumstances. O
Pshaw! O
never O
mind!" O
After O
which O
he O
smoked O
three O
pipes O
and O
went O
to O
bed. O
The O
next O
day O
when O
he O
was O
up O
(at O
about O
two O
o'clock-- O
he O
had O
slept O
late), O
Rodolphe O
had O
a O
basket O
of O
apricots O
picked. O
He O
put O
his O
letter O
at O
the O
bottom O
under O
some O
vine O
leaves, O
and O
at O
once O
ordered O
Girard, O
his O
ploughman, O
to O
take O
it O
with O
care O
to O
Madame O
Bovary. O
He O
made O
use O
of O
this O
means O
for O
corresponding O
with O
her, O
sending O
according O
to O
the O
season O
fruits O
or O
game. O
"If O
she O
asks O
after O
me," O
he O
said, O
"you O
will O
tell O
her O
that O
I O
have O
gone O
on O
a O
journey. O
You O
must O
give O
the O
basket O
to O
her O
herself, O
into O
her O
own O
hands. O
Get O
along O
and O
take O
care!" O
Girard O
put O
on O
his O
new O
blouse, O
knotted O
his O
handkerchief O
round O
the O
apricots, O
and O
walking O
with O
great O
heavy O
steps O
in O
his O
thick O
iron-bound O
galoshes, O
made O
his O
way O
to O
Yonville. O
Madame O
Bovary, O
when O
he O
got O
to O
her O
house, O
was O
arranging O
a O
bundle O
of O
linen O
on O
the O
kitchen-table O
with O
Felicite. O
"Here," O
said O
the O
ploughboy, O
"is O
something O
for O
you-- O
from O
the O
master." O
She O
was O
seized O
with O
apprehension, O
and O
as O
she O
sought O
in O
her O
pocket O
for O
some O
coppers, O
she O
looked O
at O
the O
peasant O
with O
haggard O
eyes, O
while O
he O
himself O
looked O
at O
her O
with O
amazement, O
not O
understanding O
how O
such O
a O
present O
could O
so O
move O
anyone. O
At O
last O
he O
went O
out. O
Felicite O
remained. O
She O
could O
bear O
it O
no O
longer; O
she O
ran O
into O
the O
sitting O
room O
as O
if O
to O
take O
the O
apricots O
there, O
overturned O
the O
basket, O
tore O
away O
the O
leaves, O
found O
the O
letter, O
opened O
it, O
and, O
as O
if O
some O
fearful O
fire O
were O
behind O
her, O
Emma O
flew O
to O
her O
room O
terrified. O
Charles O
was O
there; O
she O
saw O
him; O
he O
spoke O
to O
her; O
she O
heard O
nothing, O
and O
she O
went O
on O
quickly O
up O
the O
stairs, O
breathless, O
distraught, O
dumb, O
and O
ever O
holding O
this O
horrible O
piece O
of O
paper, O
that O
crackled O
between O
her O
fingers O
like O
a O
plate O
of O
sheet-iron. O
On O
the O
second O
floor O
she O
stopped O
before O
the O
attic O
door, O
which O
was O
closed. O
Then O
she O
tried O
to O
calm O
herself; O
she O
recalled O
the O
letter; O
she O
must O
finish O
it; O
she O
did O
not O
dare O
to. O
And O
where? O
How? O
She O
would O
be O
seen! O
"Ah, O
no! O
here," O
she O
thought, O
"I O
shall O
be O
all O
right." O
Emma O
pushed O
open O
the O
door O
and O
went O
in. O
The O
slates O
threw O
straight O
down O
a O
heavy O
heat O
that O
gripped O
her O
temples, O
stifled O
her; O
she O
dragged O
herself O
to O
the O
closed O
garret-window. O
She O
drew O
back O
the O
bolt, O
and O
the O
dazzling O
light O
burst O
in O
with O
a O
leap. O
Opposite, O
beyond O
the O
roofs, O
stretched O
the O
open O
country O
till O
it O
was O
lost O
to O
sight. O
Down O
below, O
underneath O
her, O
the O
village O
square O
was O
empty; O
the O
stones O
of O
the O
pavement O
glittered, O
the O
weathercocks O
on O
the O
houses O
were O
motionless. O
At O
the O
corner O
of O
the O
street, O
from O
a O
lower O
storey, O
rose O
a O
kind O
of O
humming O
with O
strident O
modulations. O
It O
was O
Binet O
turning. O
She O
leant O
against O
the O
embrasure O
of O
the O
window, O
and O
reread O
the O
letter O
with O
angry O
sneers. O
But O
the O
more O
she O
fixed O
her O
attention O
upon O
it, O
the O
more O
confused O
were O
her O
ideas. O
She O
saw O
him O
again, O
heard O
him, O
encircled O
him O
with O
her O
arms, O
and O
throbs O
of O
her O
heart, O
that O
beat O
against O
her O
breast O
like O
blows O
of O
a O
sledge-hammer, O
grew O
faster O
and O
faster, O
with O
uneven O
intervals. O
She O
looked O
about O
her O
with O
the O
wish O
that O
the O
earth O
might O
crumble O
into O
pieces. O
Why O
not O
end O
it O
all? O
What O
restrained O
her? O
She O
was O
free. O
She O
advanced, O
looking O
at O
the O
paving-stones, O
saying O
to O
herself, O
"Come! O
come!" O
The O
luminous O
ray O
that O
came O
straight O
up O
from O
below O
drew O
the O
weight O
of O
her O
body O
towards O
the O
abyss. O
It O
seemed O
to O
her O
that O
the O
ground O
of O
the O
oscillating O
square O
went O
up O
the O
walls O
and O
that O
the O
floor O
dipped O
on O
end O
like O
a O
tossing O
boat. O
She O
was O
right O
at O
the O
edge, O
almost O
hanging, O
surrounded O
by O
vast O
space. O
The O
blue O
of O
the O
heavens O
suffused O
her, O
the O
air O
was O
whirling O
in O
her O
hollow O
head; O
she O
had O
but O
to O
yield, O
to O
let O
herself O
be O
taken; O
and O
the O
humming O
of O
the O
lathe O
never O
ceased, O
like O
an O
angry O
voice O
calling O
her. O
"Emma! O
Emma!" O
cried O
Charles. O
She O
stopped. O
"Wherever O
are O
you? O
Come!" O
The O
thought O
that O
she O
had O
just O
escaped O
from O
death O
almost O
made O
her O
faint O
with O
terror. O
She O
closed O
her O
eyes; O
then O
she O
shivered O
at O
the O
touch O
of O
a O
hand O
on O
her O
sleeve; O
it O
was O
Felicite. O
"Master O
is O
waiting O
for O
you, O
madame; O
the O
soup O
is O
on O
the O
table." O
And O
she O
had O
to O
go O
down O
to O
sit O
at O
table. O
She O
tried O
to O
eat. O
The O
food O
choked O
her. O
Then O
she O
unfolded O
her O
napkin O
as O
if O
to O
examine O
the O
darns, O
and O
she O
really O
thought O
of O
applying O
herself O
to O
this O
work, O
counting O
the O
threads O
in O
the O
linen. O
Suddenly O
the O
remembrance O
of O
the O
letter O
returned O
to O
her. O
How O
had O
she O
lost O
it? O
Where O
could O
she O
find O
it? O
But O
she O
felt O
such O
weariness O
of O
spirit O
that O
she O
could O
not O
even O
invent O
a O
pretext O
for O
leaving O
the O
table. O
Then O
she O
became O
a O
coward; O
she O
was O
afraid O
of O
Charles; O
he O
knew O
all, O
that O
was O
certain! O
Indeed O
he O
pronounced O
these O
words O
in O
a O
strange O
manner: O
"We O
are O
not O
likely O
to O
see O
Monsieur O
Rodolphe O
soon O
again, O
it O
seems." O
"Who O
told O
you?" O
she O
said, O
shuddering. O
"Who O
told O
me!" O
he O
replied, O
rather O
astonished O
at O
her O
abrupt O
tone. O
"Why, O
Girard, O
whom O
I O
met O
just O
now O
at O
the O
door O
of O
the O
Cafe O
Francais. O
He O
has O
gone O
on O
a O
journey, O
or O
is O
to O
go." O
She O
gave O
a O
sob. O
"What O
surprises O
you O
in O
that? O
He O
absents O
himself O
like O
that O
from O
time O
to O
time O
for O
a O
change, O
and, O
ma O
foi, O
I O
think O
he's O
right, O
when O
one O
has O
a O
fortune O
and O
is O
a O
bachelor. O
Besides, O
he O
has O
jolly O
times, O
has O
our O
friend. O
He's O
a O
bit O
of O
a O
rake. O
Monsieur O
Langlois O
told O
me O
-- O
" O
He O
stopped O
for O
propriety's O
sake O
because O
the O
servant O
came O
in. O
She O
put O
back O
into O
the O
basket O
the O
apricots O
scattered O
on O
the O
sideboard. O
Charles, O
without O
noticing O
his O
wife's O
colour, O
had O
them O
brought O
to O
him, O
took O
one, O
and O
bit O
into O
it. O
"Ah! O
perfect!" O
said O
he; O
"just O
taste!" O
And O
he O
handed O
her O
the O
basket, O
which O
she O
put O
away O
from O
her O
gently. O
"Do O
just O
smell! O
What O
an O
odour!" O
he O
remarked, O
passing O
it O
under O
her O
nose O
several O
times. O
"I O
am O
choking," O
she O
cried, O
leaping O
up. O
But O
by O
an O
effort O
of O
will O
the O
spasm O
passed; O
then-- O
"It O
is O
nothing," O
she O
said, O
"it O
is O
nothing! O
It O
is O
nervousness. O
Sit O
down O
and O
go O
on O
eating." O
For O
she O
dreaded O
lest O
he O
should O
begin O
questioning O
her, O
attending O
to O
her, O
that O
she O
should O
not O
be O
left O
alone. O
Charles, O
to O
obey O
her, O
sat O
down O
again, O
and O
he O
spat O
the O
stones O
of O
the O
apricots O
into O
his O
hands, O
afterwards O
putting O
them O
on O
his O
plate. O
Suddenly O
a O
blue O
tilbury O
passed O
across O
the O
square O
at O
a O
rapid O
trot. O
Emma O
uttered O
a O
cry O
and O
fell O
back O
rigid O
to O
the O
ground. O
In O
fact, O
Rodolphe, O
after O
many O
reflections, O
had O
decided O
to O
set O
out O
for O
Rouen. O
Now, O
as O
from O
La O
Huchette O
to O
Buchy O
there O
is O
no O
other O
way O
than O
by O
Yonville, O
he O
had O
to O
go O
through O
the O
village, O
and O
Emma O
had O
recognised O
him O
by O
the O
rays O
of O
the O
lanterns, O
which O
like O
lightning O
flashed O
through O
the O
twilight. O
The O
chemist, O
at O
the O
tumult O
which O
broke O
out O
in O
the O
house O
ran O
thither. O
The O
table O
with O
all O
the O
plates O
was O
upset; O
sauce, O
meat, O
knives, O
the O
salt, O
and O
cruet-stand O
were O
strewn O
over O
the O
room; O
Charles O
was O
calling O
for O
help; O
Berthe, O
scared, O
was O
crying; O
and O
Felicite, O
whose O
hands O
trembled, O
was O
unlacing O
her O
mistress, O
whose O
whole O
body O
shivered O
convulsively. O
"I'll O
run O
to O
my O
laboratory O
for O
some O
aromatic O
vinegar," O
said O
the O
druggist. O
Then O
as O
she O
opened O
her O
eyes O
on O
smelling O
the O
bottle-- O
"I O
was O
sure O
of O
it," O
he O
remarked; O
"that O
would O
wake O
any O
dead O
person O
for O
you!" O
"Speak O
to O
us," O
said O
Charles; O
"collect O
yourself; O
it O
is O
your O
Charles, O
who O
loves O
you. O
Do O
you O
know O
me? O
See! O
here O
is O
your O
little O
girl! O
Oh, O
kiss O
her!" O
The O
child O
stretched O
out O
her O
arms O
to O
her O
mother O
to O
cling O
to O
her O
neck. O
But O
turning O
away O
her O
head, O
Emma O
said O
in O
a O
broken O
voice O
"No, O
no! O
no O
one!" O
She O
fainted O
again. O
They O
carried O
her O
to O
her O
bed. O
She O
lay O
there O
stretched O
at O
full O
length, O
her O
lips O
apart, O
her O
eyelids O
closed, O
her O
hands O
open, O
motionless, O
and O
white O
as O
a O
waxen O
image. O
Two O
streams O
of O
tears O
flowed O
from O
her O
eyes O
and O
fell O
slowly O
upon O
the O
pillow. O
Charles, O
standing O
up, O
was O
at O
the O
back O
of O
the O
alcove, O
and O
the O
chemist, O
near O
him, O
maintained O
that O
meditative O
silence O
that O
is O
becoming O
on O
the O
serious O
occasions O
of O
life. O
"Do O
not O
be O
uneasy," O
he O
said, O
touching O
his O
elbow; O
"I O
think O
the O
paroxysm O
is O
past." O
"Yes, O
she O
is O
resting O
a O
little O
now," O
answered O
Charles, O
watching O
her O
sleep. O
"Poor O
girl! O
poor O
girl! O
She O
had O
gone O
off O
now!" O
Then O
Homais O
asked O
how O
the O
accident O
had O
come O
about. O
Charles O
answered O
that O
she O
had O
been O
taken O
ill O
suddenly O
while O
she O
was O
eating O
some O
apricots. O
"Extraordinary!" O
continued O
the O
chemist. O
"But O
it O
might O
be O
that O
the O
apricots O
had O
brought O
on O
the O
syncope. O
Some O
natures O
are O
so O
sensitive O
to O
certain O
smells; O
and O
it O
would O
even O
be O
a O
very O
fine O
question O
to O
study O
both O
in O
its O
pathological O
and O
physiological O
relation. O
The O
priests O
know O
the O
importance O
of O
it, O
they O
who O
have O
introduced O
aromatics O
into O
all O
their O
ceremonies. O
It O
is O
to O
stupefy O
the O
senses O
and O
to O
bring O
on O
ecstasies O
-- O
a O
thing, O
moreover, O
very O
easy O
in O
persons O
of O
the O
weaker O
sex, O
who O
are O
more O
delicate O
than O
the O
other. O
Some O
are O
cited O
who O
faint O
at O
the O
smell O
of O
burnt O
hartshorn, O
of O
new O
bread O
-- O
" O
"Take O
care; O
you'll O
wake O
her!" O
said O
Bovary O
in O
a O
low O
voice. O
"And O
not O
only," O
the O
druggist O
went O
on, O
"are O
human O
beings O
subject O
to O
such O
anomalies, O
but O
animals O
also. O
Thus O
you O
are O
not O
ignorant O
of O
the O
singularly O
aphrodisiac O
effect O
produced O
by O
the O
Nepeta O
cataria, O
vulgarly O
called O
catmint, O
on O
the O
feline O
race; O
and, O
on O
the O
other O
hand, O
to O
quote O
an O
example O
whose O
authenticity O
I O
can O
answer O
for. O
Bridaux O
(one O
of O
my O
old O
comrades, O
at O
present O
established O
in O
the O
Rue O
Malpalu) O
possesses O
a O
dog O
that O
falls O
into O
convulsions O
as O
soon O
as O
you O
hold O
out O
a O
snuff-box O
to O
him. O
He O
often O
even O
makes O
the O
experiment O
before O
his O
friends O
at O
his O
summer-house O
at O
Guillaume O
Wood. O
Would O
anyone O
believe O
that O
a O
simple O
sternutation O
could O
produce O
such O
ravages O
on O
a O
quadrupedal O
organism? O
It O
is O
extremely O
curious, O
is O
it O
not?" O
"Yes," O
said O
Charles, O
who O
was O
not O
listening O
to O
him. O
"This O
shows O
us," O
went O
on O
the O
other, O
smiling O
with O
benign O
self-sufficiency, O
"the O
innumerable O
irregularities O
of O
the O
nervous O
system. O
With O
regard O
to O
madame, O
she O
has O
always O
seemed O
to O
me, O
I O
confess, O
very O
susceptible. O
And O
so O
I O
should O
by O
no O
means O
recommend O
to O
you, O
my O
dear O
friend, O
any O
of O
those O
so-called O
remedies O
that, O
under O
the O
pretence O
of O
attacking O
the O
symptoms, O
attack O
the O
constitution. O
No; O
no O
useless O
physicking! O
Diet, O
that O
is O
all; O
sedatives, O
emollients, O
dulcification. O
Then, O
don't O
you O
think O
that O
perhaps O
her O
imagination O
should O
be O
worked O
upon?" O
"In O
what O
way? O
How?" O
said O
Bovary. O
"Ah! O
that O
is O
it. O
Such O
is O
indeed O
the O
question. O
'That O
is O
the O
question,' O
as O
I O
lately O
read O
in O
a O
newspaper." O
But O
Emma, O
awaking, O
cried O
out-- O
"The O
letter! O
the O
letter!" O
They O
thought O
she O
was O
delirious; O
and O
she O
was O
by O
midnight. O
Brain-fever O
had O
set O
in. O
For O
forty-three O
days O
Charles O
did O
not O
leave O
her. O
He O
gave O
up O
all O
his O
patients; O
he O
no O
longer O
went O
to O
bed; O
he O
was O
constantly O
feeling O
her O
pulse, O
putting O
on O
sinapisms O
and O
cold-water O
compresses. O
He O
sent O
Justin O
as O
far O
as O
Neufchatel O
for O
ice; O
the O
ice O
melted O
on O
the O
way; O
he O
sent O
him O
back O
again. O
He O
called O
Monsieur O
Canivet O
into O
consultation; O
he O
sent O
for O
Dr. O
Lariviere, O
his O
old O
master, O
from O
Rouen; O
he O
was O
in O
despair. O
What O
alarmed O
him O
most O
was O
Emma's O
prostration, O
for O
she O
did O
not O
speak, O
did O
not O
listen, O
did O
not O
even O
seem O
to O
suffer, O
as O
if O
her O
body O
and O
soul O
were O
both O
resting O
together O
after O
all O
their O
troubles. O
About O
the O
middle O
of O
October O
she O
could O
sit O
up O
in O
bed O
supported O
by O
pillows. O
Charles O
wept O
when O
he O
saw O
her O
eat O
her O
first O
bread-and-jelly. O
Her O
strength O
returned O
to O
her; O
she O
got O
up O
for O
a O
few O
hours O
of O
an O
afternoon, O
and O
one O
day, O
when O
she O
felt O
better, O
he O
tried O
to O
take O
her, O
leaning O
on O
his O
arm, O
for O
a O
walk O
round O
the O
garden. O
The O
sand O
of O
the O
paths O
was O
disappearing O
beneath O
the O
dead O
leaves; O
she O
walked O
slowly, O
dragging O
along O
her O
slippers, O
and O
leaning O
against O
Charles's O
shoulder. O
She O
smiled O
all O
the O
time. O
They O
went O
thus O
to O
the O
bottom O
of O
the O
garden O
near O
the O
terrace. O
She O
drew O
herself O
up O
slowly, O
shading O
her O
eyes O
with O
her O
hand O
to O
look. O
She O
looked O
far O
off, O
as O
far O
as O
she O
could, O
but O
on O
the O
horizon O
were O
only O
great O
bonfires O
of O
grass O
smoking O
on O
the O
hills. O
"You O
will O
tire O
yourself, O
my O
darling!" O
said O
Bovary. O
And, O
pushing O
her O
gently O
to O
make O
her O
go O
into O
the O
arbour, O
"Sit O
down O
on O
this O
seat; O
you'll O
be O
comfortable." O
"Oh! O
no; O
not O
there!" O
she O
said O
in O
a O
faltering O
voice. O
She O
was O
seized O
with O
giddiness, O
and O
from O
that O
evening O
her O
illness O
recommenced, O
with O
a O
more O
uncertain O
character, O
it O
is O
true, O
and O
more O
complex O
symptoms. O
Now O
she O
suffered O
in O
her O
heart, O
then O
in O
the O
chest, O
the O
head, O
the O
limbs; O
she O
had O
vomitings, O
in O
which O
Charles O
thought O
he O
saw O
the O
first O
signs O
of O
cancer. O
And O
besides O
this, O
the O
poor O
fellow O
was O
worried O
about O
money O
matters. O
CHAPTER O
FOURTEEN O
To O
begin O
with, O
he O
did O
not O
know O
how O
he O
could O
pay O
Monsieur O
Homais O
for O
all O
the O
physic O
supplied O
by O
him, O
and O
though, O
as O
a O
medical O
man, O
he O
was O
not O
obliged O
to O
pay O
for O
it, O
he O
nevertheless O
blushed O
a O
little O
at O
such O
an O
obligation. O
Then O
the O
expenses O
of O
the O
household, O
now O
that O
the O
servant O
was O
mistress, O
became O
terrible. O
Bills O
rained O
in O
upon O
the O
house; O
the O
tradesmen O
grumbled; O
Monsieur O
Lheureux O
especially O
harassed O
him. O
In O
fact, O
at O
the O
height O
of O
Emma's O
illness, O
the O
latter, O
taking O
advantage O
of O
the O
circumstances O
to O
make O
his O
bill O
larger, O
had O
hurriedly O
brought O
the O
cloak, O
the O
travelling-bag, O
two O
trunks O
instead O
of O
one, O
and O
a O
number O
of O
other O
things. O
It O
was O
very O
well O
for O
Charles O
to O
say O
he O
did O
not O
want O
them. O
The O
tradesman O
answered O
arrogantly O
that O
these O
articles O
had O
been O
ordered, O
and O
that O
he O
would O
not O
take O
them O
back; O
besides, O
it O
would O
vex O
madame O
in O
her O
convalescence; O
the O
doctor O
had O
better O
think O
it O
over; O
in O
short, O
he O
was O
resolved O
to O
sue O
him O
rather O
than O
give O
up O
his O
rights O
and O
take O
back O
his O
goods. O
Charles O
subsequently O
ordered O
them O
to O
be O
sent O
back O
to O
the O
shop. O
Felicite O
forgot; O
he O
had O
other O
things O
to O
attend O
to; O
then O
thought O
no O
more O
about O
them. O
Monsieur O
Lheureux O
returned O
to O
the O
charge, O
and, O
by O
turns O
threatening O
and O
whining, O
so O
managed O
that O
Bovary O
ended O
by O
signing O
a O
bill O
at O
six O
months. O
But O
hardly O
had O
he O
signed O
this O
bill O
than O
a O
bold O
idea O
occurred O
to O
him: O
it O
was O
to O
borrow O
a O
thousand O
francs O
from O
Lheureux. O
So, O
with O
an O
embarrassed O
air, O
he O
asked O
if O
it O
were O
possible O
to O
get O
them, O
adding O
that O
it O
would O
be O
for O
a O
year, O
at O
any O
interest O
he O
wished. O
Lheureux O
ran O
off O
to O
his O
shop, O
brought O
back O
the O
money, O
and O
dictated O
another O
bill, O
by O
which O
Bovary O
undertook O
to O
pay O
to O
his O
order O
onDONEDET80781st O
of O
September O
next O
the O
sum O
of O
one O
thousand O
and O
seventy O
francs, O
which, O
with O
the O
hundred O
and O
eighty O
already O
agreed O
to, O
made O
just O
twelve O
hundred O
and O
fifty, O
thus O
lending O
at O
six O
per O
cent O
in O
addition O
to O
one-fourth O
for O
commission: O
and O
the O
things O
bringing O
him O
in O
a O
good O
third O
at O
the O
least, O
this O
ought O
in O
twelve O
months O
to O
give O
him O
a O
profit O
of O
a O
hundred O
and O
thirty O
francs. O
He O
hoped O
that O
the O
business O
would O
not O
stop O
there; O
that O
the O
bills O
would O
not O
be O
paid; O
that O
they O
would O
be O
renewed; O
and O
that O
his O
poor O
little O
money, O
having O
thriven O
at O
the O
doctor's O
as O
at O
a O
hospital, O
would O
come O
back O
to O
him O
one O
day O
considerably O
more O
plump, O
and O
fat O
enough O
to O
burst O
his O
bag. O
Everything, O
moreover, O
succeeded O
with O
him. O
He O
was O
adjudicator O
for O
a O
supply O
of O
cider O
to O
the O
hospital O
at O
Neufchatel; O
Monsieur O
Guillaumin O
promised O
him O
some O
shares O
in O
the O
turf-pits O
of O
Gaumesnil, O
and O
he O
dreamt O
of O
establishing O
a O
new O
diligence O
service O
between O
Arcueil O
and O
Rouen, O
which O
no O
doubt O
would O
not O
be O
long O
in O
ruining O
the O
ramshackle O
van O
of O
the O
"Lion O
d'Or," O
and O
that, O
travelling O
faster, O
at O
a O
cheaper O
rate, O
and O
carrying O
more O
luggage, O
would O
thus O
put O
into O
his O
hands O
the O
whole O
commerce O
of O
Yonville. O
Charles O
several O
times O
asked O
himself O
by O
what O
means O
he O
should O
next O
year O
be O
able O
to O
pay O
back O
so O
much O
money. O
He O
reflected, O
imagined O
expedients, O
such O
as O
applying O
to O
his O
father O
or O
selling O
something. O
But O
his O
father O
would O
be O
deaf, O
and O
he-- O
he O
had O
nothing O
to O
sell. O
Then O
he O
foresaw O
such O
worries O
that O
he O
quickly O
dismissed O
so O
disagreeable O
a O
subject O
of O
meditation O
from O
his O
mind. O
He O
reproached O
himself O
with O
forgetting O
Emma, O
as O
if, O
all O
his O
thoughts O
belonging O
to O
this O
woman, O
it O
was O
robbing O
her O
of O
something O
not O
to O
be O
constantly O
thinking O
of O
her. O
The O
winter O
was O
severe, O
Madame O
Bovary's O
convalescence O
slow. O
When O
it O
was O
fine O
they O
wheeled O
her O
arm-chair O
to O
the O
window O
that O
overlooked O
the O
square, O
for O
she O
now O
had O
an O
antipathy O
to O
the O
garden, O
and O
the O
blinds O
on O
that O
side O
were O
always O
down. O
She O
wished O
the O
horse O
to O
be O
sold; O
what O
she O
formerly O
liked O
now O
displeased O
her. O
All O
her O
ideas O
seemed O
to O
be O
limited O
to O
the O
care O
of O
herself. O
She O
stayed O
in O
bed O
taking O
little O
meals, O
rang O
for O
the O
servant O
to O
inquire O
about O
her O
gruel O
or O
to O
chat O
with O
her. O
The O
snow O
on O
the O
market-roof O
threw O
a O
white, O
still O
light O
into O
the O
room; O
then O
the O
rain O
began O
to O
fall; O
and O
Emma O
waited O
daily O
with O
a O
mind O
full O
of O
eagerness O
for O
the O
inevitable O
return O
of O
some O
trifling O
events O
which O
nevertheless O
had O
no O
relation O
to O
her. O
The O
most O
important O
was O
the O
arrival O
of O
the O
"Hirondelle" O
in O
the O
evening. O
Then O
the O
landlady O
shouted O
out, O
and O
other O
voices O
answered, O
while O
Hippolyte's O
lantern, O
as O
he O
fetched O
the O
boxes O
from O
the O
boot, O
was O
like O
a O
star O
in O
the O
darkness. O
At O
mid-day O
Charles O
came O
in; O
then O
he O
went O
out O
again; O
next O
she O
took O
some O
beef-tea, O
and O
towards O
five O
o'clock, O
as O
the O
day O
drew O
in, O
the O
children O
coming O
back O
from O
school, O
dragging O
their O
wooden O
shoes O
along O
the O
pavement, O
knocked O
the O
clapper O
of O
the O
shutters O
with O
their O
rulers O
one O
after O
the O
other. O
It O
was O
at O
this O
hour O
that O
Monsieur O
Bournisien O
came O
to O
see O
her. O
He O
inquired O
after O
her O
health, O
gave O
her O
news, O
exhorted O
her O
to O
religion, O
in O
a O
coaxing O
little O
prattle O
that O
was O
not O
without O
its O
charm. O
The O
mere O
thought O
of O
his O
cassock O
comforted O
her. O
One O
day, O
when O
at O
the O
height O
of O
her O
illness, O
she O
had O
thought O
herself O
dying, O
and O
had O
asked O
for O
the O
communion; O
and, O
while O
they O
were O
making O
the O
preparations O
in O
her O
room O
for O
the O
sacrament, O
while O
they O
were O
turning O
the O
night O
table O
covered O
with O
syrups O
into O
an O
altar, O
and O
while O
Felicite O
was O
strewing O
dahlia O
flowers O
on O
the O
floor, O
Emma O
felt O
some O
power O
passing O
over O
her O
that O
freed O
her O
from O
her O
pains, O
from O
all O
perception, O
from O
all O
feeling. O
Her O
body, O
relieved, O
no O
longer O
thought; O
another O
life O
was O
beginning; O
it O
seemed O
to O
her O
that O
her O
being, O
mounting O
toward O
God, O
would O
be O
annihilated O
in O
that O
love O
like O
a O
burning O
incense O
that O
melts O
into O
vapour. O
The O
bed-clothes O
were O
sprinkled O
with O
holy O
water, O
the O
priest O
drew O
from O
the O
holy O
pyx O
the O
white O
wafer; O
and O
it O
was O
fainting O
with O
a O
celestial O
joy O
that O
she O
put O
out O
her O
lips O
to O
accept O
the O
body O
of O
the O
Saviour O
presented O
to O
her. O
The O
curtains O
of O
the O
alcove O
floated O
gently O
round O
her O
like O
clouds, O
and O
the O
rays O
of O
the O
two O
tapers O
burning O
on O
the O
night-table O
seemed O
to O
shine O
like O
dazzling O
halos. O
Then O
she O
let O
her O
head O
fall O
back, O
fancying O
she O
heard O
in O
space O
the O
music O
of O
seraphic O
harps, O
and O
perceived O
in O
an O
azure O
sky, O
on O
a O
golden O
throne O
in O
the O
midst O
of O
saints O
holding O
green O
palms, O
God O
the O
Father, O
resplendent O
with O
majesty, O
who O
with O
a O
sign O
sent O
to O
earth O
angels O
with O
wings O
of O
fire O
to O
carry O
her O
away O
in O
their O
arms. O
This O
splendid O
vision O
dwelt O
in O
her O
memory O
as O
the O
most O
beautiful O
thing O
that O
it O
was O
possible O
to O
dream, O
so O
that O
now O
she O
strove O
to O
recall O
her O
sensation. O
That O
still O
lasted, O
however, O
but O
in O
a O
less O
exclusive O
fashion O
and O
with O
a O
deeper O
sweetness. O
Her O
soul, O
tortured O
by O
pride, O
at O
length O
found O
rest O
in O
Christian O
humility, O
and, O
tasting O
the O
joy O
of O
weakness, O
she O
saw O
within O
herself O
the O
destruction O
of O
her O
will, O
that O
must O
have O
left O
a O
wide O
entrance O
for O
the O
inroads O
of O
heavenly O
grace. O
There O
existed, O
then, O
in O
the O
place O
of O
happiness, O
still O
greater O
joys-- O
another O
love O
beyond O
all O
loves, O
without O
pause O
and O
without O
end, O
one O
that O
would O
grow O
eternally! O
She O
saw O
amid O
the O
illusions O
of O
her O
hope O
a O
state O
of O
purity O
floating O
above O
the O
earth O
mingling O
with O
heaven, O
to O
which O
she O
aspired. O
She O
wanted O
to O
become O
a O
saint. O
She O
bought O
chaplets O
and O
wore O
amulets; O
she O
wished O
to O
have O
in O
her O
room, O
by O
the O
side O
of O
her O
bed, O
a O
reliquary O
set O
in O
emeralds O
that O
she O
might O
kiss O
it O
every O
evening. O
The O
cure O
marvelled O
at O
this O
humour, O
although O
Emma's O
religion, O
he O
thought, O
might, O
from O
its O
fervour, O
end O
by O
touching O
on O
heresy, O
extravagance. O
But O
not O
being O
much O
versed O
in O
these O
matters, O
as O
soon O
as O
they O
went O
beyond O
a O
certain O
limit O
he O
wrote O
to O
Monsieur O
Boulard, O
bookseller O
to O
Monsignor, O
to O
send O
him O
"something O
good O
for O
a O
lady O
who O
was O
very O
clever." O
The O
bookseller, O
with O
as O
much O
indifference O
as O
if O
he O
had O
been O
sending O
off O
hardware O
to O
niggers, O
packed O
up, O
pellmell, O
everything O
that O
was O
then O
the O
fashion O
in O
the O
pious O
book O
trade. O
There O
were O
little O
manuals O
in O
questions O
and O
answers, O
pamphlets O
of O
aggressive O
tone O
after O
the O
manner O
of O
Monsieur O
de O
Maistre, O
and O
certain O
novels O
in O
rose-coloured O
bindings O
and O
with O
a O
honied O
style, O
manufactured O
by O
troubadour O
seminarists O
or O
penitent O
blue-stockings. O
There O
were O
the O
"Think O
of O
it; O
the O
Man O
of O
the O
World O
at O
Mary's O
Feet, O
by O
Monsieur O
de, O
decorated O
with O
many O
Orders"; O
"The O
Errors O
of O
Voltaire, O
for O
the O
Use O
of O
the O
Young," O
etc. O
Madame O
Bovary's O
mind O
was O
not O
yet O
sufficiently O
clear O
to O
apply O
herself O
seriously O
to O
anything; O
moreover, O
she O
began O
this O
reading O
in O
too O
much O
hurry. O
She O
grew O
provoked O
at O
the O
doctrines O
of O
religion; O
the O
arrogance O
of O
the O
polemic O
writings O
displeased O
her O
by O
their O
inveteracy O
in O
attacking O
people O
she O
did O
not O
know; O
and O
the O
secular O
stories, O
relieved O
with O
religion, O
seemed O
to O
her O
written O
in O
such O
ignorance O
of O
the O
world, O
that O
they O
insensibly O
estranged O
her O
from O
the O
truths O
for O
whose O
proof O
she O
was O
looking. O
Nevertheless, O
she O
persevered; O
and O
when O
the O
volume O
slipped O
from O
her O
hands, O
she O
fancied O
herself O
seized O
with O
the O
finest O
Catholic O
melancholy O
that O
an O
ethereal O
soul O
could O
conceive. O
As O
for O
the O
memory O
of O
Rodolphe, O
she O
had O
thrust O
it O
back O
to O
the O
bottom O
of O
her O
heart, O
and O
it O
remained O
there O
more O
solemn O
and O
more O
motionless O
than O
a O
king's O
mummy O
in O
a O
catacomb. O
An O
exhalation O
escaped O
from O
this O
embalmed O
love, O
that, O
penetrating O
through O
everything, O
perfumed O
with O
tenderness O
the O
immaculate O
atmosphere O
in O
which O
she O
longed O
to O
live. O
When O
she O
knelt O
on O
her O
Gothic O
prie-Dieu, O
she O
addressed O
to O
the O
Lord O
the O
same O
suave O
words O
that O
she O
had O
murmured O
formerly O
to O
her O
lover O
in O
the O
outpourings O
of O
adultery. O
It O
was O
to O
make O
faith O
come; O
but O
no O
delights O
descended O
from O
the O
heavens, O
and O
she O
arose O
with O
tired O
limbs O
and O
with O
a O
vague O
feeling O
of O
a O
gigantic O
dupery. O
This O
searching O
after O
faith, O
she O
thought, O
was O
only O
one O
merit O
the O
more, O
and O
in O
the O
pride O
of O
her O
devoutness O
Emma O
compared O
herself O
to O
those O
grand O
ladies O
of O
long O
ago O
whose O
glory O
she, O
had O
dreamed O
of O
over O
a O
portrait O
of O
La O
Valliere, O
and O
who, O
trailing O
with O
so O
much O
majesty O
the O
lace-trimmed O
trains O
of O
their O
long O
gowns, O
retired O
into O
solitudes O
to O
shed O
at O
the O
feet O
of O
Christ O
all O
the O
tears O
of O
hearts O
that O
life O
had O
wounded. O
Then O
she O
gave O
herself O
up O
to O
excessive O
charity. O
She O
sewed O
clothes O
for O
the O
poor, O
she O
sent O
wood O
to O
women O
in O
childbed; O
and O
Charles O
one O
day, O
on O
coming O
home, O
found O
three O
good-for-nothings O
in O
the O
kitchen O
seated O
at O
the O
table O
eating O
soup. O
She O
had O
her O
little O
girl, O
whom O
during O
her O
illness O
her O
husband O
had O
sent O
back O
to O
the O
nurse, O
brought O
home. O
She O
wanted O
to O
teach O
her O
to O
read; O
even O
when O
Berthe O
cried, O
she O
was O
not O
vexed. O
She O
had O
made O
up O
her O
mind O
to O
resignation, O
to O
universal O
indulgence. O
Her O
language O
about O
everything O
was O
full O
of O
ideal O
expressions. O
She O
said O
to O
her O
child, O
"Is O
your O
stomach-ache O
better, O
my O
angel?" O
Madame O
Bovary O
senior O
found O
nothing O
to O
censure O
except O
perhaps O
this O
mania O
of O
knitting O
jackets O
for O
orphans O
instead O
of O
mending O
her O
own O
house-linen; O
but, O
harassed O
with O
domestic O
quarrels, O
the O
good O
woman O
took O
pleasure O
in O
this O
quiet O
house, O
and O
she O
even O
stayed O
there O
till O
after O
Easter, O
to O
escape O
the O
sarcasms O
of O
old O
Bovary, O
who O
never O
failed O
on O
Good O
Friday O
to O
order O
chitterlings. O
Besides O
the O
companionship O
of O
her O
mother-in-law, O
who O
strengthened O
her O
a O
little O
by O
the O
rectitude O
of O
her O
judgment O
and O
her O
grave O
ways, O
Emma O
almost O
every O
day O
had O
other O
visitors. O
These O
were O
Madame O
Langlois, O
Madame O
Caron, O
Madame O
Dubreuil, O
Madame O
Tuvache, O
and O
regularly O
from O
two O
to O
five O
o'clock O
the O
excellent O
Madame O
Homais, O
who, O
for O
her O
part, O
had O
never O
believed O
any O
of O
the O
tittle-tattle O
about O
her O
neighbour. O
The O
little O
Homais O
also O
came O
to O
see O
her; O
Justin O
accompanied O
them. O
He O
went O
up O
with O
them O
to O
her O
bedroom, O
and O
remained O
standing O
near O
the O
door, O
motionless O
and O
mute. O
Often O
even O
Madame O
Bovary; O
taking O
no O
heed O
of O
him, O
began O
her O
toilette. O
She O
began O
by O
taking O
out O
her O
comb, O
shaking O
her O
head O
with O
a O
quick O
movement, O
and O
when O
he O
for O
the O
first O
time O
saw O
all O
this O
mass O
of O
hair O
that O
fell O
to O
her O
knees O
unrolling O
in O
black O
ringlets, O
it O
was O
to O
him, O
poor O
child! O
like O
a O
sudden O
entrance O
into O
something O
new O
and O
strange, O
whose O
splendour O
terrified O
him. O
Emma, O
no O
doubt, O
did O
not O
notice O
his O
silent O
attentions O
or O
his O
timidity. O
She O
had O
no O
suspicion O
that O
the O
love O
vanished O
from O
her O
life O
was O
there, O
palpitating O
by O
her O
side, O
beneath O
that O
coarse O
holland O
shirt, O
in O
that O
youthful O
heart O
open O
to O
the O
emanations O
of O
her O
beauty. O
Besides, O
she O
now O
enveloped O
all O
things O
with O
such O
indifference, O
she O
had O
words O
so O
affectionate O
with O
looks O
so O
haughty, O
such O
contradictory O
ways, O
that O
one O
could O
no O
longer O
distinguish O
egotism O
from O
charity, O
or O
corruption O
from O
virtue. O
One O
evening, O
for O
example, O
she O
was O
angry O
with O
the O
servant, O
who O
had O
asked O
to O
go O
out, O
and O
stammered O
as O
she O
tried O
to O
find O
some O
pretext. O
THEN O
SUDDENLY-- O
"So O
you O
love O
him?" O
she O
said. O
And O
without O
waiting O
for O
any O
answer O
from O
Felicite, O
who O
was O
blushing, O
she O
added, O
"There! O
run O
along; O
enjoy O
yourself!" O
In O
the O
beginning O
of O
spring O
she O
had O
the O
garden O
turned O
up O
from O
end O
to O
end, O
despite O
Bovary's O
remonstrances. O
However, O
he O
was O
glad O
to O
see O
her O
at O
last O
manifest O
a O
wish O
of O
any O
kind. O
As O
she O
grew O
stronger O
she O
displayed O
more O
wilfulness. O
First, O
she O
found O
occasion O
to O
expel O
Mere O
Rollet, O
the O
nurse, O
who O
during O
her O
convalescence O
had O
contracted O
the O
habit O
of O
coming O
too O
often O
to O
the O
kitchen O
with O
her O
two O
nurslings O
and O
her O
boarder, O
better O
off O
for O
teeth O
than O
a O
cannibal. O
Then O
she O
got O
rid O
of O
the O
Homais O
family, O
successively O
dismissed O
all O
the O
other O
visitors, O
and O
even O
frequented O
church O
less O
assiduously, O
to O
the O
great O
approval O
of O
the O
druggist, O
who O
said O
to O
her O
in O
a O
friendly O
way-- O
"You O
were O
going O
in O
a O
bit O
for O
the O
cassock!" O
As O
formerly, O
Monsieur O
Bournisien O
dropped O
in O
every O
day O
when O
he O
came O
out O
after O
catechism O
class. O
He O
preferred O
staying O
out O
of O
doors O
to O
taking O
the O
air O
"in O
the O
grove," O
as O
he O
called O
the O
arbour. O
This O
was O
the O
time O
when O
Charles O
came O
home. O
They O
were O
hot; O
some O
sweet O
cider O
was O
brought O
out, O
and O
they O
drank O
together O
to O
madame's O
complete O
restoration. O
Binet O
was O
there; O
that O
is O
to O
say, O
a O
little O
lower O
down O
against O
the O
terrace O
wall, O
fishing O
for O
crayfish. O
Bovary O
invited O
him O
to O
have O
a O
drink, O
and O
he O
thoroughly O
understood O
the O
uncorking O
of O
the O
stone O
bottles. O
"You O
must," O
he O
said, O
throwing O
a O
satisfied O
glance O
all O
round O
him, O
even O
to O
the O
very O
extremity O
of O
the O
landscape, O
"hold O
the O
bottle O
perpendicularly O
on O
the O
table, O
and O
after O
the O
strings O
are O
cut, O
press O
up O
the O
cork O
with O
little O
thrusts, O
gently, O
gently, O
as O
indeed O
they O
do O
seltzer-water O
at O
restaurants." O
But O
during O
his O
demonstration O
the O
cider O
often O
spurted O
right O
into O
their O
faces, O
and O
then O
the O
ecclesiastic, O
with O
a O
thick O
laugh, O
never O
missed O
this O
joke-- O
"Its O
goodness O
strikes O
the O
eye!" O
He O
was, O
in O
fact, O
a O
good O
fellow O
and O
one O
day O
he O
was O
not O
even O
scandalised O
at O
the O
chemist, O
who O
advised O
Charles O
to O
give O
madame O
some O
distraction O
by O
taking O
her O
to O
the O
theatre O
at O
Rouen O
to O
hear O
the O
illustrious O
tenor, O
Lagardy. O
Homais, O
surprised O
at O
this O
silence, O
wanted O
to O
know O
his O
opinion, O
and O
the O
priest O
declared O
that O
he O
considered O
music O
less O
dangerous O
for O
morals O
than O
literature. O
But O
the O
chemist O
took O
up O
the O
defence O
of O
letters. O
The O
theatre, O
he O
contended, O
served O
for O
railing O
at O
prejudices, O
and, O
beneath O
a O
mask O
of O
pleasure, O
taught O
virtue. O
"'Castigat O
ridendo O
mores,' O
Monsieur O
Bournisien! O
Thus O
consider O
the O
greater O
part O
of O
Voltaire's O
tragedies; O
they O
are O
cleverly O
strewn O
with O
philosophical O
reflections, O
that O
made O
them O
a O
vast O
school O
of O
morals O
and O
diplomacy O
for O
the O
people." O
IT O
CORRECTS O
CUSTOMS O
THROUGH O
LAUGHTER. O
"I," O
said O
Binet, O
"once O
saw O
a O
piece O
called O
the O
'Gamin O
de O
Paris,' O
in O
which O
there O
was O
the O
character O
of O
an O
old O
general O
that O
is O
really O
hit O
off O
to O
a O
T. O
He O
sets O
down O
a O
young O
swell O
who O
had O
seduced O
a O
working O
girl, O
who O
at O
the O
ending O
-- O
" O
"Certainly," O
continued O
Homais, O
"there O
is O
bad O
literature O
as O
there O
is O
bad O
pharmacy, O
but O
to O
condemn O
in O
a O
lump O
the O
most O
important O
of O
the O
fine O
arts O
seems O
to O
me O
a O
stupidity, O
a O
Gothic O
idea, O
worthy O
of O
the O
abominable O
times O
that O
imprisoned O
Galileo." O
"I O
know O
very O
well," O
objected O
the O
cure, O
"that O
there O
are O
good O
works, O
good O
authors. O
However, O
if O
it O
were O
only O
those O
persons O
of O
different O
sexes O
united O
in O
a O
bewitching O
apartment, O
decorated O
rouge, O
those O
lights, O
those O
effeminate O
voices, O
all O
this O
must, O
in O
the O
long-run, O
engender O
a O
certain O
mental O
libertinage, O
give O
rise O
to O
immodest O
thoughts O
and O
impure O
temptations. O
Such, O
at O
any O
rate, O
is O
the O
opinion O
of O
all O
the O
Fathers. O
Finally," O
he O
added, O
suddenly O
assuming O
a O
mystic O
tone O
of O
voice O
while O
he O
rolled O
a O
pinch O
of O
snuff O
between O
his O
fingers, O
"if O
the O
Church O
has O
condemned O
the O
theatre, O
she O
must O
be O
right; O
we O
must O
submit O
to O
her O
decrees." O
"Why," O
asked O
the O
druggist, O
"should O
she O
excommunicate O
actors? O
For O
formerly O
they O
openly O
took O
part O
in O
religious O
ceremonies. O
Yes, O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
chancel O
they O
acted; O
they O
performed O
a O
kind O
of O
farce O
called O
'Mysteries,' O
which O
often O
offended O
against O
the O
laws O
of O
decency." O
The O
ecclesiastic O
contented O
himself O
with O
uttering O
a O
groan, O
and O
the O
chemist O
went O
on-- O
"It's O
like O
it O
is O
in O
the O
Bible; O
there O
there O
are, O
you O
know, O
more O
than O
one O
piquant O
detail, O
matters O
really O
libidinous!" O
And O
on O
a O
gesture O
of O
irritation O
from O
Monsieur O
Bournisien-- O
"Ah! O
you'll O
admit O
that O
it O
is O
not O
a O
book O
to O
place O
in O
the O
hands O
of O
a O
young O
girl, O
and O
I O
should O
be O
sorry O
if O
Athalie O
-- O
" O
"But O
it O
is O
the O
Protestants, O
and O
not O
we," O
cried O
the O
other O
impatiently, O
"who O
recommend O
the O
Bible." O
"No O
matter," O
said O
Homais. O
"I O
am O
surprised O
that O
in O
our O
days, O
in O
this O
century O
of O
enlightenment, O
anyone O
should O
still O
persist O
in O
proscribing O
an O
intellectual O
relaxation O
that O
is O
inoffensive, O
moralising, O
and O
sometimes O
even O
hygienic; O
is O
it O
not, O
doctor?" O
"No O
doubt," O
replied O
the O
doctor O
carelessly, O
either O
because, O
sharing O
the O
same O
ideas, O
he O
wished O
to O
offend O
no O
one, O
or O
else O
because O
he O
had O
not O
any O
ideas. O
The O
conversation O
seemed O
at O
an O
end O
when O
the O
chemist O
thought O
fit O
to O
shoot O
a O
Parthian O
arrow. O
"I've O
known O
priests O
who O
put O
on O
ordinary O
clothes O
to O
go O
and O
see O
dancers O
kicking O
about." O
"Come, O
come!" O
said O
the O
cure. O
"Ah! O
I've O
known O
some!" O
And O
separating O
the O
words O
of O
his O
sentence, O
Homais O
repeated, O
"I-- O
have-- O
known-- O
some!" O
"Well, O
they O
were O
wrong," O
said O
Bournisien, O
resigned O
to O
anything. O
"By O
Jove! O
they O
go O
in O
for O
more O
than O
that," O
exclaimed O
the O
druggist. O
"Sir!" O
replied O
the O
ecclesiastic, O
with O
such O
angry O
eyes O
that O
the O
druggist O
was O
intimidated O
by O
them. O
"I O
only O
mean O
to O
say," O
he O
replied O
in O
less O
brutal O
a O
tone, O
"that O
toleration O
is O
the O
surest O
way O
to O
draw O
people O
to O
religion." O
"That O
is O
true! O
that O
is O
true!" O
agreed O
the O
good O
fellow, O
sitting O
down O
again O
on O
his O
chair. O
But O
he O
stayed O
only O
a O
few O
moments. O
Then, O
as O
soon O
as O
he O
had O
gone, O
Monsieur O
Homais O
said O
to O
the O
doctor-- O
"That's O
what O
I O
call O
a O
cock-fight. O
I O
beat O
him, O
did O
you O
see, O
in O
a O
way!-- O
Now O
take O
my O
advice. O
Take O
madame O
to O
the O
theatre, O
if O
it O
were O
only O
for O
once O
in O
your O
life, O
to O
enrage O
one O
of O
these O
ravens, O
hang O
it! O
If O
anyone O
could O
take O
my O
place, O
I O
would O
accompany O
you O
myself. O
Be O
quick O
about O
it. O
Lagardy O
is O
only O
going O
to O
give O
one O
performance; O
he's O
engaged O
to O
go O
to O
England O
at O
a O
high O
salary. O
From O
what O
I O
hear, O
he's O
a O
regular O
dog; O
he's O
rolling O
in O
money; O
he's O
taking O
three O
mistresses O
and O
a O
cook O
along O
with O
him. O
All O
these O
great O
artists O
burn O
the O
candle O
at O
both O
ends; O
they O
require O
a O
dissolute O
life, O
that O
suits O
the O
imagination O
to O
some O
extent. O
But O
they O
die O
at O
the O
hospital, O
because O
they O
haven't O
the O
sense O
when O
young O
to O
lay O
by. O
Well, O
a O
pleasant O
dinner! O
Goodbye O
till O
to-morrow." O
The O
idea O
of O
the O
theatre O
quickly O
germinated O
in O
Bovary's O
head, O
for O
he O
at O
once O
communicated O
it O
to O
his O
wife, O
who O
at O
first O
refused, O
alleging O
the O
fatigue, O
the O
worry, O
the O
expense; O
but, O
for O
a O
wonder, O
Charles O
did O
not O
give O
in, O
so O
sure O
was O
he O
that O
this O
recreation O
would O
be O
good O
for O
her. O
He O
saw O
nothing O
to O
prevent O
it: O
his O
mother O
had O
sent O
them O
three O
hundred O
francs O
which O
he O
had O
no O
longer O
expected; O
the O
current O
debts O
were O
not O
very O
large, O
and O
the O
falling O
in O
of O
Lheureux's O
bills O
was O
still O
so O
far O
off O
that O
there O
was O
no O
need O
to O
think O
about O
them. O
Besides, O
imagining O
that O
she O
was O
refusing O
from O
delicacy, O
he O
insisted O
the O
more; O
so O
that O
by O
dint O
of O
worrying O
her O
she O
at O
last O
made O
up O
her O
mind, O
and O
the O
next O
day O
at O
eight O
o'clock O
they O
set O
out O
in O
the O
"Hirondelle." O
The O
druggist, O
whom O
nothing O
whatever O
kept O
at O
Yonville, O
but O
who O
thought O
himself O
bound O
not O
to O
budge O
from O
it, O
sighed O
as O
he O
saw O
them O
go. O
"Well, O
a O
pleasant O
journey!" O
he O
said O
to O
them; O
"happy O
mortals O
that O
you O
are!" O
Then O
addressing O
himself O
to O
Emma, O
who O
was O
wearing O
a O
blue O
silk O
gown O
with O
four O
flounces-- O
"You O
are O
as O
lovely O
as O
a O
Venus. O
You'll O
cut O
a O
figure O
at O
Rouen." O
The O
diligence O
stopped O
at O
the O
"Croix-Rouge" O
in O
the O
Place O
Beauvoisine. O
It O
was O
the O
inn O
that O
is O
in O
every O
provincial O
faubourg, O
with O
large O
stables O
and O
small O
bedrooms, O
where O
one O
sees O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
court O
chickens O
pilfering O
the O
oats O
under O
the O
muddy O
gigs O
of O
the O
commercial O
travellers O
-- O
a O
good O
old O
house, O
with O
worm-eaten O
balconies O
that O
creak O
in O
the O
wind O
on O
winter O
nights, O
always O
full O
of O
people, O
noise, O
and O
feeding, O
whose O
black O
tables O
are O
sticky O
with O
coffee O
and O
brandy, O
the O
thick O
windows O
made O
yellow O
by O
the O
flies, O
the O
damp O
napkins O
stained O
with O
cheap O
wine, O
and O
that O
always O
smells O
of O
the O
village, O
like O
ploughboys O
dressed O
in O
Sundayclothes, O
has O
a O
cafe O
on O
the O
street, O
and O
towards O
the O
countryside O
a O
kitchen-garden. O
Charles O
at O
once O
set O
out. O
He O
muddled O
up O
the O
stage-boxes O
with O
the O
gallery, O
the O
pit O
with O
the O
boxes; O
asked O
for O
explanations, O
did O
not O
understand O
them; O
was O
sent O
from O
the O
box-office O
to O
the O
acting-manager; O
came O
back O
to O
the O
inn, O
returned O
to O
the O
theatre, O
and O
thus O
several O
times O
traversed O
the O
whole O
length O
of O
the O
town O
from O
the O
theatre O
to O
the O
boulevard. O
Madame O
Bovary O
bought O
a O
bonnet, O
gloves, O
and O
a O
bouquet. O
The O
doctor O
was O
much O
afraid O
of O
missing O
the O
beginning, O
and, O
without O
having O
had O
time O
to O
swallow O
a O
plate O
of O
soup, O
they O
presented O
themselves O
at O
the O
doors O
of O
the O
theatre, O
which O
were O
still O
closed. O
CHAPTER O
FIFTEEN O
The O
crowd O
was O
waiting O
against O
the O
wall, O
symmetrically O
enclosed O
between O
the O
balustrades. O
At O
the O
corner O
of O
the O
neighbouring O
streets O
huge O
bills O
repeated O
in O
quaint O
letters O
"Lucie O
de O
Lammermoor-Lagardy-Opera-etc." O
The O
weather O
was O
fine, O
the O
people O
were O
hot, O
perspiration O
trickled O
amid O
the O
curls, O
and O
handkerchiefs O
taken O
from O
pockets O
were O
mopping O
red O
foreheads; O
and O
now O
and O
then O
a O
warm O
wind O
that O
blew O
from O
the O
river O
gently O
stirred O
the O
border O
of O
the O
tick O
awnings O
hanging O
from O
the O
doors O
of O
the O
public-houses. O
A O
little O
lower O
down, O
however, O
one O
was O
refreshed O
by O
a O
current O
of O
icy O
air O
that O
smelt O
of O
tallow, O
leather, O
and O
oil. O
This O
was O
an O
exhalation O
from O
the O
Rue O
des O
Charrettes, O
full O
of O
large O
black O
warehouses O
where O
they O
made O
casks. O
For O
fear O
of O
seeming O
ridiculous, O
Emma O
before O
going O
in O
wished O
to O
have O
a O
little O
stroll O
in O
the O
harbour, O
and O
Bovary O
prudently O
kept O
his O
tickets O
in O
his O
hand, O
in O
the O
pocket O
of O
his O
trousers, O
which O
he O
pressed O
against O
his O
stomach. O
Her O
heart O
began O
to O
beat O
as O
soon O
as O
she O
reached O
the O
vestibule. O
She O
involuntarily O
smiled O
with O
vanity O
on O
seeing O
the O
crowd O
rushing O
to O
the O
right O
by O
the O
other O
corridor O
while O
she O
went O
up O
the O
staircase O
to O
the O
reserved O
seats. O
She O
was O
as O
pleased O
as O
a O
child O
to O
push O
with O
her O
finger O
the O
large O
tapestried O
door. O
She O
breathed O
in O
with O
all O
her O
might O
the O
dusty O
smell O
of O
the O
lobbies, O
and O
when O
she O
was O
seated O
in O
her O
box O
she O
bent O
forward O
with O
the O
air O
of O
a O
duchess. O
The O
theatre O
was O
beginning O
to O
fill; O
opera-glasses O
were O
taken O
from O
their O
cases, O
and O
the O
subscribers, O
catching O
sight O
of O
one O
another, O
were O
bowing. O
They O
came O
to O
seek O
relaxation O
in O
the O
fine O
arts O
after O
the O
anxieties O
of O
business; O
but O
"business" O
was O
not O
forgotten; O
they O
still O
talked O
cottons, O
spirits O
of O
wine, O
or O
indigo. O
The O
heads O
of O
old O
men O
were O
to O
be O
seen, O
inexpressive O
and O
peaceful, O
with O
their O
hair O
and O
complexions O
looking O
like O
silver O
medals O
tarnished O
by O
steam O
of O
lead. O
The O
young O
beaux O
were O
strutting O
about O
in O
the O
pit, O
showing O
in O
the O
opening O
of O
their O
waistcoats O
their O
pink O
or O
applegreen O
cravats, O
and O
Madame O
Bovary O
from O
above O
admired O
them O
leaning O
on O
their O
canes O
with O
golden O
knobs O
in O
the O
open O
palm O
of O
their O
yellow O
gloves. O
Now O
the O
lights O
of O
the O
orchestra O
were O
lit, O
the O
lustre, O
let O
down O
from O
the O
ceiling, O
throwing O
by O
the O
glimmering O
of O
its O
facets O
a O
sudden O
gaiety O
over O
the O
theatre; O
then O
the O
musicians O
came O
in O
one O
after O
the O
other; O
and O
first O
there O
was O
the O
protracted O
hubbub O
of O
the O
basses O
grumbling, O
violins O
squeaking, O
cornets O
trumpeting, O
flutes O
and O
flageolets O
fifing. O
But O
three O
knocks O
were O
heard O
on O
the O
stage, O
a O
rolling O
of O
drums O
began, O
the O
brass O
instruments O
played O
some O
chords, O
and O
the O
curtain O
rising, O
discovered O
a O
country-scene. O
It O
was O
the O
cross-roads O
of O
a O
wood, O
with O
a O
fountain O
shaded O
by O
an O
oak O
to O
the O
left. O
Peasants O
and O
lords O
with O
plaids O
on O
their O
shoulders O
were O
singing O
a O
hunting-song O
together; O
then O
a O
captain O
suddenly O
came O
on, O
who O
evoked O
the O
spirit O
of O
evil O
by O
lifting O
both O
his O
arms O
to O
heaven. O
Another O
appeared; O
they O
went O
away, O
and O
the O
hunters O
started O
afresh. O
She O
felt O
herself O
transported O
to O
the O
reading O
of O
her O
youth, O
into O
the O
midst O
of O
Walter O
Scott. O
She O
seemed O
to O
hear O
through O
the O
mist O
the O
sound O
of O
the O
Scotch O
bagpipes O
re-echoing O
over O
the O
heather. O
Then O
her O
remembrance O
of O
the O
novel O
helping O
her O
to O
understand O
the O
libretto, O
she O
followed O
the O
story O
phrase O
by O
phrase, O
while O
vague O
thoughts O
that O
came O
back O
to O
her O
dispersed O
at O
once O
again O
with O
the O
bursts O
of O
music. O
She O
gave O
herself O
up O
to O
the O
lullaby O
of O
the O
melodies, O
and O
felt O
all O
her O
being O
vibrate O
as O
if O
the O
violin O
bows O
were O
drawn O
over O
her O
nerves. O
She O
had O
not O
eyes O
enough O
to O
look O
at O
the O
costumes, O
the O
scenery, O
the O
actors, O
the O
painted O
trees O
that O
shook O
when O
anyone O
walked, O
and O
the O
velvet O
caps, O
cloaks, O
swords-- O
all O
those O
imaginary O
things O
that O
floated O
amid O
the O
harmony O
as O
in O
the O
atmosphere O
of O
another O
world. O
But O
a O
young O
woman O
stepped O
forward, O
throwing O
a O
purse O
to O
a O
squire O
in O
green. O
She O
was O
left O
alone, O
and O
the O
flute O
was O
heard O
like O
the O
murmur O
of O
a O
fountain O
or O
the O
warbling O
of O
birds. O
Lucie O
attacked O
her O
cavatina O
in O
G O
major O
bravely. O
She O
plained O
of O
love; O
she O
longed O
for O
wings. O
Emma, O
too, O
fleeing O
from O
life, O
would O
have O
liked O
to O
fly O
away O
in O
an O
embrace. O
Suddenly O
Edgar-Lagardy O
appeared. O
He O
had O
that O
splendid O
pallor O
that O
gives O
something O
of O
the O
majesty O
of O
marble O
to O
the O
ardent O
races O
of O
the O
South. O
His O
vigorous O
form O
was O
tightly O
clad O
in O
a O
brown-coloured O
doublet; O
a O
small O
chiselled O
poniard O
hung O
against O
his O
left O
thigh, O
and O
he O
cast O
round O
laughing O
looks O
showing O
his O
white O
teeth. O
They O
said O
that O
a O
Polish O
princess O
having O
heard O
him O
sing O
one O
night O
on O
the O
beach O
at O
Biarritz, O
where O
he O
mended O
boats, O
had O
fallen O
in O
love O
with O
him. O
She O
had O
ruined O
herself O
for O
him. O
He O
had O
deserted O
her O
for O
other O
women, O
and O
this O
sentimental O
celebrity O
did O
not O
fail O
to O
enhance O
his O
artistic O
reputation. O
The O
diplomatic O
mummer O
took O
care O
always O
to O
slip O
into O
his O
advertisements O
some O
poetic O
phrase O
on O
the O
fascination O
of O
his O
person O
and O
the O
susceptibility O
of O
his O
soul. O
A O
fine O
organ, O
imperturbable O
coolness, O
more O
temperament O
than O
intelligence, O
more O
power O
of O
emphasis O
than O
of O
real O
singing, O
made O
up O
the O
charm O
of O
this O
admirable O
charlatan O
nature, O
in O
which O
there O
was O
something O
of O
the O
hairdresser O
and O
the O
toreador. O
From O
the O
first O
scene O
he O
evoked O
enthusiasm. O
He O
pressed O
Lucy O
in O
his O
arms, O
he O
left O
her, O
he O
came O
back, O
he O
seemed O
desperate; O
he O
had O
outbursts O
of O
rage, O
then O
elegiac O
gurglings O
of O
infinite O
sweetness, O
and O
the O
notes O
escaped O
from O
his O
bare O
neck O
full O
of O
sobs O
and O
kisses. O
Emma O
leant O
forward O
to O
see O
him, O
clutching O
the O
velvet O
of O
the O
box O
with O
her O
nails. O
She O
was O
filling O
her O
heart O
with O
these O
melodious O
lamentations O
that O
were O
drawn O
out O
to O
the O
accompaniment O
of O
the O
double-basses, O
like O
the O
cries O
of O
the O
drowning O
in O
the O
tumult O
of O
a O
tempest. O
She O
recognised O
all O
the O
intoxication O
and O
the O
anguish O
that O
had O
almost O
killed O
her. O
The O
voice O
of O
a O
prima O
donna O
seemed O
to O
her O
to O
be O
but O
echoes O
of O
her O
conscience, O
and O
this O
illusion O
that O
charmed O
her O
as O
some O
very O
thing O
of O
her O
own O
life. O
But O
no O
one O
on O
earth O
had O
loved O
her O
with O
such O
love. O
He O
had O
not O
wept O
like O
Edgar O
that O
last O
moonlit O
night O
when O
they O
said, O
"To-morrow! O
to-morrow!" O
The O
theatre O
rang O
with O
cheers; O
they O
recommenced O
the O
entire O
movement; O
the O
lovers O
spoke O
of O
the O
flowers O
on O
their O
tomb, O
of O
vows, O
exile, O
fate, O
hopes; O
and O
when O
they O
uttered O
the O
final O
adieu, O
Emma O
gave O
a O
sharp O
cry O
that O
mingled O
with O
the O
vibrations O
of O
the O
last O
chords. O
"But O
why," O
asked O
Bovary, O
"does O
that O
gentleman O
persecute O
her?" O
"No, O
no!" O
she O
answered; O
"he O
is O
her O
lover!" O
"Yet O
he O
vows O
vengeance O
on O
her O
family, O
while O
the O
other O
one O
who O
came O
on O
before O
said, O
'I O
love O
Lucie O
and O
she O
loves O
me!' O
Besides, O
he O
went O
off O
with O
her O
father O
arm O
in O
arm. O
For O
he O
certainly O
is O
her O
father, O
isn't O
he-- O
the O
ugly O
little O
man O
with O
a O
cock's O
feather O
in O
his O
hat?" O
Despite O
Emma's O
explanations, O
as O
soon O
as O
the O
recitative O
duet O
began O
in O
which O
Gilbert O
lays O
bare O
his O
abominable O
machinations O
to O
his O
master O
Ashton, O
Charles, O
seeing O
the O
false O
troth-ring O
that O
is O
to O
deceive O
Lucie, O
thought O
it O
was O
a O
love-gift O
sent O
by O
Edgar. O
He O
confessed, O
moreover, O
that O
he O
did O
not O
understand O
the O
story O
because O
of O
the O
music, O
which O
interfered O
very O
much O
with O
the O
words. O
"What O
does O
it O
matter?" O
said O
Emma. O
"Do O
be O
quiet!" O
"Yes, O
but O
you O
know," O
he O
went O
on, O
leaning O
against O
her O
shoulder, O
"I O
like O
to O
understand O
things." O
"Be O
quiet! O
be O
quiet!" O
she O
cried O
impatiently. O
Lucie O
advanced, O
half O
supported O
by O
her O
women, O
a O
wreath O
of O
orange O
blossoms O
in O
her O
hair, O
and O
paler O
than O
the O
white O
satin O
of O
her O
gown. O
Emma O
dreamed O
of O
her O
marriage O
day; O
she O
saw O
herself O
at O
home O
again O
amid O
the O
corn O
in O
the O
little O
path O
as O
they O
walked O
to O
the O
church. O
Oh, O
why O
had O
not O
she, O
like O
this O
woman, O
resisted, O
implored? O
She, O
on O
the O
contrary, O
had O
been O
joyous, O
without O
seeing O
the O
abyss O
into O
which O
she O
was O
throwing O
herself. O
Ah! O
if O
in O
the O
freshness O
of O
her O
beauty, O
before O
the O
soiling O
of O
marriage O
and O
the O
disillusions O
of O
adultery, O
she O
could O
have O
anchored O
her O
life O
upon O
some O
great, O
strong O
heart, O
then O
virtue, O
tenderness, O
voluptuousness, O
and O
duty O
blending, O
she O
would O
never O
have O
fallen O
from O
so O
high O
a O
happiness. O
But O
that O
happiness, O
no O
doubt, O
was O
a O
lie O
invented O
for O
the O
despair O
of O
all O
desire. O
She O
now O
knew O
the O
smallness O
of O
the O
passions O
that O
art O
exaggerated. O
So, O
striving O
to O
divert O
her O
thoughts, O
Emma O
determined O
now O
to O
see O
in O
this O
reproduction O
of O
her O
sorrows O
only O
a O
plastic O
fantasy, O
well O
enough O
to O
please O
the O
eye, O
and O
she O
even O
smiled O
internally O
with O
disdainful O
pity O
when O
at O
the O
back O
of O
the O
stage O
under O
the O
velvet O
hangings O
a O
man O
appeared O
in O
a O
black O
cloak. O
His O
large O
Spanish O
hat O
fell O
at O
a O
gesture O
he O
made, O
and O
immediately O
the O
instruments O
and O
the O
singers O
began O
the O
sextet. O
Edgar, O
flashing O
with O
fury, O
dominated O
all O
the O
others O
with O
his O
clearer O
voice; O
Ashton O
hurled O
homicidal O
provocations O
at O
him O
in O
deep O
notes; O
Lucie O
uttered O
her O
shrill O
plaint, O
Arthur O
at O
one O
side, O
his O
modulated O
tones O
in O
the O
middle O
register, O
and O
the O
bass O
of O
the O
minister O
pealed O
forth O
like O
an O
organ, O
while O
the O
voices O
of O
the O
women O
repeating O
his O
words O
took O
them O
up O
in O
chorus O
delightfully. O
They O
were O
all O
in O
a O
row O
gesticulating, O
and O
anger, O
vengeance, O
jealousy, O
terror, O
and O
stupefaction O
breathed O
forth O
at O
once O
from O
their O
half-opened O
mouths. O
The O
outraged O
lover O
brandished O
his O
naked O
sword; O
his O
guipure O
ruffle O
rose O
with O
jerks O
to O
the O
movements O
of O
his O
chest, O
and O
he O
walked O
from O
right O
to O
left O
with O
long O
strides, O
clanking O
against O
the O
boards O
the O
silver-gilt O
spurs O
of O
his O
soft O
boots, O
widening O
out O
at O
the O
ankles. O
He, O
she O
thought O
must O
have O
an O
inexhaustible O
love O
to O
lavish O
it O
upon O
the O
crowd O
with O
such O
effusion. O
All O
her O
small O
fault-findings O
faded O
before O
the O
poetry O
of O
the O
part O
that O
absorbed O
her; O
and, O
drawn O
towards O
this O
man O
by O
the O
illusion O
of O
the O
character, O
she O
tried O
to O
imagine O
to O
herself O
his O
life-- O
that O
life O
resonant, O
extraordinary, O
splendid, O
and O
that O
might O
have O
been O
hers O
if O
fate O
had O
willed O
it. O
They O
would O
have O
known O
one O
another, O
loved O
one O
another. O
With O
him, O
through O
all O
the O
kingdoms O
of O
Europe O
she O
would O
have O
travelled O
from O
capital O
to O
capital, O
sharing O
his O
fatigues O
and O
his O
pride, O
picking O
up O
the O
flowers O
thrown O
to O
him, O
herself O
embroidering O
his O
costumes. O
Then O
each O
evening, O
at O
the O
back O
of O
a O
box, O
behind O
the O
golden O
trellis-work O
she O
would O
have O
drunk O
in O
eagerly O
the O
expansions O
of O
this O
soul O
that O
would O
have O
sung O
for O
her O
alone; O
from O
the O
stage, O
even O
as O
he O
acted, O
he O
would O
have O
looked O
at O
her. O
But O
the O
mad O
idea O
seized O
her O
that O
he O
was O
looking O
at O
her; O
it O
was O
certain. O
She O
longed O
to O
run O
to O
his O
arms, O
to O
take O
refuge O
in O
his O
strength, O
as O
in O
the O
incarnation O
of O
love O
itself, O
and O
to O
say O
to O
him, O
to O
cry O
out, O
"Take O
me O
away! O
carry O
me O
with O
you! O
let O
us O
go! O
Thine, O
thine! O
all O
my O
ardour O
and O
all O
my O
dreams!" O
The O
curtain O
fell. O
The O
smell O
of O
the O
gas O
mingled O
with O
that O
of O
the O
breaths, O
the O
waving O
of O
the O
fans, O
made O
the O
air O
more O
suffocating. O
Emma O
wanted O
to O
go O
out; O
the O
crowd O
filled O
the O
corridors, O
and O
she O
fell O
back O
in O
her O
arm-chair O
with O
palpitations O
that O
choked O
her. O
Charles, O
fearing O
that O
she O
would O
faint, O
ran O
to O
the O
refreshment-room O
to O
get O
a O
glass O
of O
barley-water. O
He O
had O
great O
difficulty O
in O
getting O
back O
to O
his O
seat, O
for O
his O
elbows O
were O
jerked O
at O
every O
step O
because O
of O
the O
glass O
he O
held O
in O
his O
hands, O
and O
he O
even O
spilt O
three-fourths O
on O
the O
shoulders O
of O
a O
Rouen O
lady O
in O
short O
sleeves, O
who O
feeling O
the O
cold O
liquid O
running O
down O
to O
her O
loins, O
uttered O
cries O
like O
a O
peacock, O
as O
if O
she O
were O
being O
assassinated. O
Her O
husband, O
who O
was O
a O
millowner, O
railed O
at O
the O
clumsy O
fellow, O
and O
while O
she O
was O
with O
her O
handkerchief O
wiping O
up O
the O
stains O
from O
her O
handsome O
cherry-coloured O
taffeta O
gown, O
he O
angrily O
muttered O
about O
indemnity, O
costs, O
reimbursement. O
At O
last O
Charles O
reached O
his O
wife, O
saying O
to O
her, O
quite O
out O
of O
breath-- O
"Ma O
foi! O
I O
thought O
I O
should O
have O
had O
to O
stay O
there. O
There O
is O
such O
a O
crowd-- O
SUCH O
a O
crowd!" O
HE O
ADDED-- O
"Just O
guess O
whom O
I O
met O
up O
there! O
Monsieur O
Leon!" O
"Leon?" O
"Himself! O
He's O
coming O
along O
to O
pay O
his O
respects." O
And O
as O
he O
finished O
these O
words O
the O
ex-clerk O
of O
Yonville O
entered O
the O
box. O
He O
held O
out O
his O
hand O
with O
the O
ease O
of O
a O
gentleman; O
and O
Madame O
Bovary O
extended O
hers, O
without O
doubt O
obeying O
the O
attraction O
of O
a O
stronger O
will. O
She O
had O
not O
felt O
it O
since O
that O
spring O
evening O
when O
the O
rain O
fell O
upon O
the O
green O
leaves, O
and O
they O
had O
said O
good-bye O
standing O
at O
the O
window. O
But O
soon O
recalling O
herself O
to O
the O
necessities O
of O
the O
situation, O
with O
an O
effort O
she O
shook O
off O
the O
torpor O
of O
her O
memories, O
and O
began O
stammering O
a O
few O
hurried O
words. O
"Ah, O
good-day! O
What! O
you O
here?" O
"Silence!" O
cried O
a O
voice O
from O
the O
pit, O
for O
the O
third O
act O
was O
beginning. O
"So O
you O
are O
at O
Rouen?" O
"Yes." O
"And O
since O
when?" O
"Turn O
them O
out! O
turn O
them O
out!" O
People O
were O
looking O
at O
them. O
They O
were O
silent. O
But O
from O
that O
moment O
she O
listened O
no O
more; O
and O
the O
chorus O
of O
the O
guests, O
the O
scene O
between O
Ashton O
and O
his O
servant, O
the O
grand O
duet O
in O
D O
major, O
all O
were O
for O
her O
as O
far O
off O
as O
if O
the O
instruments O
had O
grown O
less O
sonorous O
and O
the O
characters O
more O
remote. O
She O
remembered O
the O
games O
at O
cards O
at O
the O
druggist's, O
and O
the O
walk O
to O
the O
nurse's, O
the O
reading O
in O
the O
arbour, O
the O
tete-a-tete O
by O
the O
fireside-- O
all O
that O
poor O
love, O
so O
calm O
and O
so O
protracted, O
so O
discreet, O
so O
tender, O
and O
that O
she O
had O
nevertheless O
forgotten. O
And O
why O
had O
he O
come O
back? O
What O
combination O
of O
circumstances O
had O
brought O
him O
back O
into O
her O
life? O
He O
was O
standing O
behind O
her, O
leaning O
with O
his O
shoulder O
against O
the O
wall O
of O
the O
box; O
now O
and O
again O
she O
felt O
herself O
shuddering O
beneath O
the O
hot O
breath O
from O
his O
nostrils O
falling O
upon O
her O
hair. O
"Does O
this O
amuse O
you?" O
said O
he, O
bending O
over O
her O
so O
closely O
that O
the O
end O
of O
his O
moustache O
brushed O
her O
cheek. O
She O
replied O
carelessly-- O
"Oh, O
dear O
me, O
no, O
not O
much." O
Then O
he O
proposed O
that O
they O
should O
leave O
the O
theatre O
and O
go O
and O
take O
an O
ice O
somewhere. O
"Oh, O
not O
yet; O
let O
us O
stay," O
said O
Bovary. O
"Her O
hair's O
undone; O
this O
is O
going O
to O
be O
tragic." O
But O
the O
mad O
scene O
did O
not O
at O
all O
interest O
Emma, O
and O
the O
acting O
of O
the O
singer O
seemed O
to O
her O
exaggerated. O
"She O
screams O
too O
loud," O
said O
she, O
turning O
to O
Charles, O
who O
was O
listening. O
"Yes O
-- O
a O
little," O
he O
replied, O
undecided O
between O
the O
frankness O
of O
his O
pleasure O
and O
his O
respect O
for O
his O
wife's O
opinion. O
THEN O
WITH O
A O
SIGH O
LEON O
SAID-- O
"The O
heat O
is O
-- O
" O
"Unbearable! O
Yes!" O
"Do O
you O
feel O
unwell?" O
asked O
Bovary. O
"Yes, O
I O
am O
stifling; O
let O
us O
go." O
Monsieur O
Leon O
put O
her O
long O
lace O
shawl O
carefully O
about O
her O
shoulders, O
and O
all O
three O
went O
off O
to O
sit O
down O
in O
the O
harbour, O
in O
the O
open O
air, O
outside O
the O
windows O
of O
a O
cafe. O
First O
they O
spoke O
of O
her O
illness, O
although O
Emma O
interrupted O
Charles O
from O
time O
to O
time, O
for O
fear, O
she O
said, O
of O
boring O
Monsieur O
Leon; O
and O
the O
latter O
told O
them O
that O
he O
had O
come O
to O
spend O
two O
years O
at O
Rouen O
in O
a O
large O
office, O
in O
order O
to O
get O
practice O
in O
his O
profession, O
which O
was O
different O
in O
Normandy O
and O
Paris. O
Then O
he O
inquired O
after O
Berthe, O
the O
Homais, O
Mere O
Lefrancois, O
and O
as O
they O
had, O
in O
the O
husband's O
presence, O
nothing O
more O
to O
say O
to O
one O
another, O
the O
conversation O
soon O
came O
to O
an O
end. O
People O
coming O
out O
of O
the O
theatre O
passed O
along O
the O
pavement, O
humming O
or O
shouting O
at O
the O
top O
of O
their O
voices, O
"O O
bel O
ange, O
ma O
Lucie!" O
Then O
Leon, O
playing O
the O
dilettante, O
began O
to O
talk O
music. O
He O
had O
seen O
Tambourini, O
Rubini, O
Persiani, O
Grisi, O
and, O
compared O
with O
them, O
Lagardy, O
despite O
his O
grand O
outbursts, O
was O
nowhere. O
OH O
BEAUTIFUL O
ANGEL, O
MY O
LUCIE. O
"Yet," O
interrupted O
Charles, O
who O
was O
slowly O
sipping O
his O
rum-sherbet, O
"they O
say O
that O
he O
is O
quite O
admirable O
in O
the O
last O
act. O
I O
regret O
leaving O
before O
the O
end, O
because O
it O
was O
beginning O
to O
amuse O
me." O
"Why," O
said O
the O
clerk, O
"he O
will O
soon O
give O
another O
performance." O
But O
Charles O
replied O
that O
they O
were O
going O
back O
next O
day. O
"Unless," O
he O
added, O
turning O
to O
his O
wife, O
"you O
would O
like O
to O
stay O
alone, O
kitten?" O
And O
changing O
his O
tactics O
at O
this O
unexpected O
opportunity O
that O
presented O
itself O
to O
his O
hopes, O
the O
young O
man O
sang O
the O
praises O
of O
Lagardy O
in O
the O
last O
number. O
It O
was O
really O
superb, O
sublime. O
Then O
Charles O
insisted-- O
"You O
would O
get O
back O
on O
Sunday. O
Come, O
make O
up O
your O
mind. O
You O
are O
wrong O
if O
you O
feel O
that O
this O
is O
doing O
you O
the O
least O
good." O
The O
tables O
round O
them, O
however, O
were O
emptying; O
a O
waiter O
came O
and O
stood O
discreetly O
near O
them. O
Charles, O
who O
understood, O
took O
out O
his O
purse; O
the O
clerk O
held O
back O
his O
arm, O
and O
did O
not O
forget O
to O
leave O
two O
more O
pieces O
of O
silver O
that O
he O
made O
chink O
on O
the O
marble. O
"I O
am O
really O
sorry," O
said O
Bovary, O
"about O
the O
money O
which O
you O
are O
-- O
" O
The O
other O
made O
a O
careless O
gesture O
full O
of O
cordiality, O
and O
taking O
his O
hat O
said-- O
"It O
is O
settled, O
isn't O
it? O
To-morrow O
at O
six O
o'clock?" O
Charles O
explained O
once O
more O
that O
he O
could O
not O
absent O
himself O
longer, O
but O
that O
nothing O
prevented O
Emma-- O
"But," O
she O
stammered, O
with O
a O
strange O
smile, O
"I O
am O
not O
sure O
-- O
" O
"Well, O
you O
must O
think O
it O
over. O
We'll O
see. O
Night O
brings O
counsel." O
Then O
to O
Leon, O
who O
was O
walking O
along O
with O
them, O
"Now O
that O
you O
are O
in O
our O
part O
of O
the O
world, O
I O
hope O
you'll O
come O
and O
ask O
us O
for O
some O
dinner O
now O
and O
then." O
The O
clerk O
declared O
he O
would O
not O
fail O
to O
do O
so, O
being O
obliged, O
moreover, O
to O
go O
to O
Yonville O
on O
some O
business O
for O
his O
office. O
And O
they O
parted O
before O
the O
Saint-Herbland O
Passage O
just O
as O
the O
clock O
in O
the O
cathedral O
struck O
half-past O
eleven. O

 O

 O
PART O
III O
CHAPTER O
ONE O
Monsieur O
Leon, O
while O
studying O
law, O
had O
gone O
pretty O
often O
to O
the O
dancing-rooms, O
where O
he O
was O
even O
a O
great O
success O
amongst O
the O
grisettes, O
who O
thought O
he O
had O
a O
distinguished O
air. O
He O
was O
the O
best-mannered O
of O
the O
students; O
he O
wore O
his O
hair O
neither O
too O
long O
nor O
too O
short, O
didn't O
spend O
all O
his O
quarter's O
money O
on O
the O
first O
day O
of O
the O
month, O
and O
kept O
on O
good O
terms O
with O
his O
professors. O
As O
for O
excesses, O
he O
had O
always O
abstained O
from O
them, O
as O
much O
from O
cowardice O
as O
from O
refinement. O
Often O
when O
he O
stayed O
in O
his O
room O
to O
read, O
or O
else O
when O
sitting O
of O
an O
evening O
under O
the O
lime-trees O
of O
the O
Luxembourg, O
he O
let O
his O
Code O
fall O
to O
the O
ground, O
and O
the O
memory O
of O
Emma O
came O
back O
to O
him. O
But O
gradually O
this O
feeling O
grew O
weaker, O
and O
other O
desires O
gathered O
over O
it, O
although O
it O
still O
persisted O
through O
them O
all. O
For O
Leon O
did O
not O
lose O
all O
hope; O
there O
was O
for O
him, O
as O
it O
were, O
a O
vague O
promise O
floating O
in O
the O
future, O
like O
a O
golden O
fruit O
suspended O
from O
some O
fantastic O
tree. O
Then, O
seeing O
her O
again O
after O
three O
years O
of O
absence O
his O
passion O
reawakened. O
He O
must, O
he O
thought, O
at O
last O
make O
up O
his O
mind O
to O
possess O
her. O
Moreover, O
his O
timidity O
had O
worn O
off O
by O
contact O
with O
his O
gay O
companions, O
and O
he O
returned O
to O
the O
provinces O
despising O
everyone O
who O
had O
not O
with O
varnished O
shoes O
trodden O
the O
asphalt O
of O
the O
boulevards. O
By O
the O
side O
of O
a O
Parisienne O
in O
her O
laces, O
in O
the O
drawing-room O
of O
some O
illustrious O
physician, O
a O
person O
driving O
his O
carriage O
and O
wearing O
many O
orders, O
the O
poor O
clerk O
would O
no O
doubt O
have O
trembled O
like O
a O
child; O
but O
here, O
at O
Rouen, O
on O
the O
harbour, O
with O
the O
wife O
of O
this O
small O
doctor O
he O
felt O
at O
his O
ease, O
sure O
beforehand O
he O
would O
shine. O
Self-possession O
depends O
on O
its O
environment. O
We O
don't O
speak O
on O
the O
first O
floor O
as O
on O
the O
fourth; O
and O
the O
wealthy O
woman O
seems O
to O
have, O
about O
her, O
to O
guard O
her O
virtue, O
all O
her O
banknotes, O
like O
a O
cuirass O
in O
the O
lining O
of O
her O
corset. O
On O
leaving O
the O
Bovarys O
the O
night O
before, O
Leon O
had O
followed O
them O
through O
the O
streets O
at O
a O
distance; O
then O
having O
seen O
them O
stop O
at O
the O
"Croix-Rouge," O
he O
turned O
on O
his O
heel, O
and O
spent O
the O
night O
meditating O
a O
plan. O
So O
the O
next O
day O
about O
five O
o'clock O
he Entity
walked O
into O
the O
kitchen O
of O
the O
inn, O
with O
a O
choking O
sensation O
in O
his O
throat, O
pale O
cheeks, O
and O
that O
resolution O
of O
cowards O
that O
stops O
at O
nothing. O
"The Quotation
gentleman Quotation
isn't Quotation
in," Quotation
answered Cue
a Entity
servant. Entity
This O
seemed O
to O
him O
a O
good O
omen. O
He O
went O
upstairs. O
She O
was O
not O
disturbed O
at O
his Entity
approach; O
on O
the O
contrary, O
she Entity
apologised Cue
for Quotation
having Quotation
neglected Quotation
to Quotation
tell Quotation
him Quotation
where Quotation
they Quotation
were Quotation
staying. Quotation
"Oh, Quotation
I Quotation
divined Quotation
it!" Quotation
said Cue
Leon. Entity
He O
pretended O
he O
had O
been O
guided O
towards O
her O
by O
chance, O
by, O
instinct. O
She O
began O
to O
smile; O
and O
at O
once, O
to O
repair O
his O
folly, O
Leon Entity
told Cue
her Entity
that Quotation
he Quotation
had Quotation
spent Quotation
his Quotation
morning Quotation
in Quotation
looking Quotation
for Quotation
her Quotation
in Quotation
all Quotation
the Quotation
hotels Quotation
in Quotation
the Quotation
town Quotation
one Quotation
after Quotation
the Quotation
other. Quotation
"So Quotation
you Quotation
have Quotation
made Quotation
up Quotation
your Quotation
mind Quotation
to Quotation
stay?" Quotation
he Entity
added. Cue
"Yes," Quotation
she Entity
said, Cue
"and Quotation
I Quotation
am Quotation
wrong. Quotation
One Quotation
ought Quotation
not Quotation
to Quotation
accustom Quotation
oneself Quotation
to Quotation
impossible Quotation
pleasures Quotation
when Quotation
there Quotation
are Quotation
a Quotation
thousand Quotation
demands Quotation
upon Quotation
one." Quotation
"Oh, Quotation
I Quotation
can Quotation
imagine!" Quotation
"Ah! Quotation
no; Quotation
for Quotation
you, Quotation
you Quotation
are Quotation
a Quotation
man!" Quotation
But O
men O
too O
had O
had O
their O
trials, O
and O
the O
conversation O
went O
off O
into O
certain O
philosophical O
reflections. O
Emma Entity
expatiated Cue
much O
on Quotation
the Quotation
misery Quotation
of Quotation
earthly Quotation
affections, Quotation
and Quotation
the Quotation
eternal Quotation
isolation Quotation
in Quotation
which Quotation
the Quotation
heart Quotation
remains Quotation
entombed. Quotation
To O
show O
off, O
or O
from O
a O
naive O
imitation O
of O
this O
melancholy O
which O
called O
forth O
his, O
the Entity
young Entity
man Entity
declared Cue
that Quotation
he Quotation
had Quotation
been Quotation
awfully Quotation
bored Quotation
during Quotation
the Quotation
whole Quotation
course Quotation
of Quotation
his Quotation
studies. Quotation
The O
law O
irritated O
him, O
other O
vocations O
attracted O
him, O
and O
his O
mother O
never O
ceased O
worrying O
him O
in O
every O
one O
of O
her O
letters. O
As O
they O
talked O
they O
explained O
more O
and O
more O
fully O
the O
motives O
of O
their O
sadness, O
working O
themselves O
up O
in O
their O
progressive O
confidence. O
But O
they O
sometimes O
stopped O
short O
of O
the O
complete O
exposition O
of O
their O
thought, O
and O
then O
sought O
to O
invent O
a O
phrase O
that O
might O
express O
it O
all O
the O
same. O
She O
did O
not O
confess O
her O
passion O
for O
another; O
he O
did O
not O
say O
that O
he O
had O
forgotten O
her. O
Perhaps O
he Entity
no O
longer O
remembered O
his O
suppers O
with O
girls O
after O
masked O
balls; O
and O
no O
doubt O
she O
did O
not O
recollect O
the O
rendezvous O
of O
old O
when O
she O
ran O
across O
the O
fields O
in O
the O
morning O
to O
her O
lover's O
house. O
The O
noises O
of O
the O
town O
hardly O
reached O
them, O
and O
the O
room O
seemed O
small, O
as O
if O
on O
purpose O
to O
hem O
in O
their O
solitude O
more O
closely. O
Emma, O
in O
a O
dimity O
dressing-gown, O
leant O
her O
head O
against O
the O
back O
of O
the O
old O
arm-chair; O
the O
yellow O
wall-paper O
formed, O
as O
it O
were, O
a O
golden O
background O
behind O
her, O
and O
her O
bare O
head O
was O
mirrored O
in O
the O
glass O
with O
the O
white O
parting O
in O
the O
middle, O
and O
the O
tip O
of O
her O
ears O
peeping O
out O
from O
the O
folds O
of O
her O
hair. O
"But Quotation
pardon Quotation
me!" Quotation
she Entity
said. Cue
"It Quotation
is Quotation
wrong Quotation
of Quotation
me. Quotation
I Quotation
weary Quotation
you Quotation
with Quotation
my Quotation
eternal Quotation
complaints." Quotation
"No, Quotation
never, Quotation
never!" Quotation
"If Quotation
you Quotation
knew," Quotation
she Entity
went Cue
on, Cue
raising O
to O
the O
ceiling O
her O
beautiful O
eyes, O
in O
which O
a O
tear O
was O
trembling, O
"all Quotation
that Quotation
I Quotation
had Quotation
dreamed!" Quotation
"And Quotation
I! Quotation
Oh, Quotation
I Quotation
too Quotation
have Quotation
suffered! Quotation
Often Quotation
I Quotation
went Quotation
out; Quotation
I Quotation
went Quotation
away. Quotation
I Quotation
dragged Quotation
myself Quotation
along Quotation
the Quotation
quays, Quotation
seeking Quotation
distraction Quotation
amid Quotation
the Quotation
din Quotation
of Quotation
the Quotation
crowd Quotation
without Quotation
being Quotation
able Quotation
to Quotation
banish Quotation
the Quotation
heaviness Quotation
that Quotation
weighed Quotation
upon Quotation
me. Quotation
In Quotation
an Quotation
engraver's Quotation
shop Quotation
on Quotation
the Quotation
boulevard Quotation
there Quotation
is Quotation
an Quotation
Italian Quotation
print Quotation
of Quotation
one Quotation
of Quotation
the Quotation
Muses. Quotation
She Quotation
is Quotation
draped Quotation
in Quotation
a Quotation
tunic, Quotation
and Quotation
she Quotation
is Quotation
looking Quotation
at Quotation
the Quotation
moon, Quotation
with Quotation
forget-me-nots Quotation
in Quotation
her Quotation
flowing Quotation
hair. Quotation
Something Quotation
drove Quotation
me Quotation
there Quotation
continually; Quotation
I Quotation
stayed Quotation
there Quotation
hours Quotation
together." Quotation
Then O
in O
a O
trembling O
voice, O
"She Quotation
resembled Quotation
you Quotation
a Quotation
little." Quotation
Madame Entity
Bovary Entity
turned O
away O
her O
head O
that O
he O
might O
not O
see O
the O
irrepressible O
smile O
she O
felt O
rising O
to O
her O
lips. O
"Often," Quotation
he Entity
went Cue
on, Cue
"I Quotation
wrote Quotation
you Quotation
letters Quotation
that Quotation
I Quotation
tore Quotation
up." Quotation
She Entity
did O
not O
answer. O
He Entity
continued-- Cue
"I Quotation
sometimes Quotation
fancied Quotation
that Quotation
some Quotation
chance Quotation
would Quotation
bring Quotation
you. Quotation
I Quotation
thought Quotation
I Quotation
recognised Quotation
you Quotation
at Quotation
street-corners, Quotation
and Quotation
I Quotation
ran Quotation
after Quotation
all Quotation
the Quotation
carriages Quotation
through Quotation
whose Quotation
windows Quotation
I Quotation
saw Quotation
a Quotation
shawl Quotation
fluttering, Quotation
a Quotation
veil Quotation
like Quotation
yours." Quotation
She O
seemed O
resolved O
to O
let O
him O
go O
on O
speaking O
without O
interruption. O
Crossing O
her O
arms O
and O
bending O
down O
her O
face, O
she O
looked O
at O
the O
rosettes O
on O
her O
slippers, O
and O
at O
intervals O
made O
little O
movements O
inside O
the O
satin O
of O
them O
with O
her O
toes. O
At O
last O
she Entity
sighed. O
"But Quotation
the Quotation
most Quotation
wretched Quotation
thing, Quotation
is Quotation
it Quotation
not-- Quotation
is Quotation
to Quotation
drag Quotation
out, Quotation
as Quotation
I Quotation
do, Quotation
a Quotation
useless Quotation
existence. Quotation
If Quotation
our Quotation
pains Quotation
were Quotation
only Quotation
of Quotation
some Quotation
use Quotation
to Quotation
someone, Quotation
we Quotation
should Quotation
find Quotation
consolation Quotation
in Quotation
the Quotation
thought Quotation
of Quotation
the Quotation
sacrifice." Quotation
He Entity
started O
off O
in O
praise O
of O
virtue, O
duty, O
and O
silent O
immolation, O
having O
himself O
an O
incredible O
longing O
for O
self-sacrifice O
that O
he O
could O
not O
satisfy. O
"I Quotation
should Quotation
much Quotation
like," Quotation
she Entity
said, Cue
"to Quotation
be Quotation
a Quotation
nurse Quotation
at Quotation
a Quotation
hospital." Quotation
"Alas! Quotation
men Quotation
have Quotation
none Quotation
of Quotation
these Quotation
holy Quotation
missions, Quotation
and Quotation
I Quotation
see Quotation
nowhere Quotation
any Quotation
calling-- Quotation
unless Quotation
perhaps Quotation
that Quotation
of Quotation
a Quotation
doctor." Quotation
With O
a O
slight O
shrug O
of O
her O
shoulders, O
Emma Entity
interrupted O
him Entity
to O
speak Cue
of Quotation
her Quotation
illness, Quotation
which Quotation
had Quotation
almost Quotation
killed Quotation
her. Quotation
What O
a O
pity! O
She O
should O
not O
be O
suffering O
now! O
Leon O
at O
once O
envied O
the O
calm O
of O
the O
tomb, O
and O
one O
evening O
he O
had O
even O
made O
his O
will, O
asking O
to O
be O
buried O
in O
that O
beautiful O
rug O
with O
velvet O
stripes O
he O
had O
received O
from O
her. O
For O
this O
was O
how O
they O
would O
have O
wished O
to O
be, O
each O
setting O
up O
an O
ideal O
to O
which O
they O
were O
now O
adapting O
their O
past O
life. O
Besides, O
speech O
is O
a O
rolling-mill O
that O
always O
thins O
out O
the O
sentiment. O
But O
at O
this O
invention O
of O
the O
rug O
she Entity
asked, Cue
"But Quotation
why?" Quotation
"Why?" Quotation
He Entity
hesitated. O
"Because Quotation
I Quotation
loved Quotation
you Quotation
so!" Quotation
And O
congratulating O
himself O
at O
having O
surmounted O
the O
difficulty, O
Leon O
watched O
her O
face O
out O
of O
the O
corner O
of O
his O
eyes. O
It O
was O
like O
the O
sky O
when O
a O
gust O
of O
wind O
drives O
the O
clouds O
across. O
The O
mass O
of O
sad O
thoughts O
that O
darkened O
them O
seemed O
to O
be O
lifted O
from O
her O
blue O
eyes; O
her O
whole O
face O
shone. O
He Entity
waited. O
At O
last O
she Entity
replied-- Cue
"I Quotation
always Quotation
suspected Quotation
it." Quotation
Then O
they Entity
went Cue
over Cue
all Quotation
the Quotation
trifling Quotation
events Quotation
of Quotation
that Quotation
far-off Quotation
existence, Quotation
whose Quotation
joys Quotation
and Quotation
sorrows Quotation
they Quotation
had Quotation
just Quotation
summed Quotation
up Quotation
in Quotation
one Quotation
word. Quotation
They Entity
recalled Cue
the Quotation
arbour Quotation
with Quotation
clematis, Quotation
the Quotation
dresses Quotation
she Quotation
had Quotation
worn, Quotation
the Quotation
furniture Quotation
of Quotation
her Quotation
room, Quotation
the Quotation
whole Quotation
of Quotation
her Quotation
house. Quotation
"And Quotation
our Quotation
poor Quotation
cactuses, Quotation
where Quotation
are Quotation
they?" Quotation
"The Quotation
cold Quotation
killed Quotation
them Quotation
this Quotation
winter." Quotation
"Ah! Quotation
how Quotation
I Quotation
have Quotation
thought Quotation
of Quotation
them, Quotation
do Quotation
you Quotation
know? Quotation
I Quotation
often Quotation
saw Quotation
them Quotation
again Quotation
as Quotation
of Quotation
yore, Quotation
when Quotation
on Quotation
the Quotation
summer Quotation
mornings Quotation
the Quotation
sun Quotation
beat Quotation
down Quotation
upon Quotation
your Quotation
blinds, Quotation
and Quotation
I Quotation
saw Quotation
your Quotation
two Quotation
bare Quotation
arms Quotation
passing Quotation
out Quotation
amongst Quotation
the Quotation
flowers." Quotation
"Poor Quotation
friend!" Quotation
she Entity
said, Cue
holding O
out O
her O
hand O
to O
him. Entity
Leon O
swiftly O
pressed O
his O
lips O
to O
it. O
Then, O
when O
he Entity
had O
taken O
a O
deep O
breath-- O
"At Quotation
that Quotation
time Quotation
you Quotation
were Quotation
to Quotation
me Quotation
I Quotation
know Quotation
not Quotation
what Quotation
incomprehensible Quotation
force Quotation
that Quotation
took Quotation
captive Quotation
my Quotation
life. Quotation
Once, Quotation
for Quotation
instance, Quotation
I Quotation
went Quotation
to Quotation
see Quotation
you; Quotation
but Quotation
you, Quotation
no Quotation
doubt, Quotation
do Quotation
not Quotation
remember Quotation
it." Quotation
"I Quotation
do," Quotation
she Entity
said; Cue
"go Quotation
on." Quotation
"You Quotation
were Quotation
downstairs Quotation
in Quotation
the Quotation
ante-room, Quotation
ready Quotation
to Quotation
go Quotation
out, Quotation
standing Quotation
on Quotation
the Quotation
last Quotation
stair; Quotation
you Quotation
were Quotation
wearing Quotation
a Quotation
bonnet Quotation
with Quotation
small Quotation
blue Quotation
flowers; Quotation
and Quotation
without Quotation
any Quotation
invitation Quotation
from Quotation
you, Quotation
in Quotation
spite Quotation
of Quotation
myself, Quotation
I Quotation
went Quotation
with Quotation
you. Quotation
Every Quotation
moment, Quotation
however, Quotation
I Quotation
grew Quotation
more Quotation
and Quotation
more Quotation
conscious Quotation
of Quotation
my Quotation
folly, Quotation
and Quotation
I Quotation
went Quotation
on Quotation
walking Quotation
by Quotation
you, Quotation
not Quotation
daring Quotation
to Quotation
follow Quotation
you Quotation
completely, Quotation
and Quotation
unwilling Quotation
to Quotation
leave Quotation
you. Quotation
When Quotation
you Quotation
went Quotation
into Quotation
a Quotation
shop, Quotation
I Quotation
waited Quotation
in Quotation
the Quotation
street, Quotation
and Quotation
I Quotation
watched Quotation
you Quotation
through Quotation
the Quotation
window Quotation
taking Quotation
off Quotation
your Quotation
gloves Quotation
and Quotation
counting Quotation
the Quotation
change Quotation
on Quotation
the Quotation
counter. Quotation
Then Quotation
you Quotation
rang Quotation
at Quotation
Madame Quotation
Tuvache's; Quotation
you Quotation
were Quotation
let Quotation
in, Quotation
and Quotation
I Quotation
stood Quotation
like Quotation
an Quotation
idiot Quotation
in Quotation
front Quotation
of Quotation
the Quotation
great Quotation
heavy Quotation
door Quotation
that Quotation
had Quotation
closed Quotation
after Quotation
you." Quotation
Madame O
Bovary, O
as O
she O
listened O
to O
him, Entity
wondered O
that O
she O
was O
so O
old. O
All O
these O
things O
reappearing O
before O
her O
seemed O
to O
widen O
out O
her O
life; O
it O
was O
like O
some O
sentimental O
immensity O
to O
which O
she O
returned; O
and O
from O
time O
to O
time O
she Entity
said Cue
in O
a O
low O
voice, O
her O
eyes O
half O
closed-- O
"Yes, Quotation
it Quotation
is Quotation
true-- Quotation
true-- Quotation
true!" Quotation
They O
heard O
eight O
strike O
on O
the O
different O
clocks O
of O
the O
Beauvoisine O
quarter, O
which O
is O
full O
of O
schools, O
churches, O
and O
large O
empty O
hotels. O
They O
no O
longer O
spoke, O
but O
they O
felt O
as O
they O
looked O
upon O
each O
other O
a O
buzzing O
in O
their O
heads, O
as O
if O
something O
sonorous O
had O
escaped O
from O
the O
fixed O
eyes O
of O
each O
of O
them. O
They O
were O
hand O
in O
hand O
now, O
and O
the O
past, O
the O
future, O
reminiscences O
and O
dreams, O
all O
were O
confounded O
in O
the O
sweetness O
of O
this O
ecstasy. O
Night O
was O
darkening O
over O
the O
walls, O
on O
which O
still O
shone, O
half O
hidden O
in O
the O
shade, O
the O
coarse O
colours O
of O
four O
bills O
representing O
four O
scenes O
from O
the O
"Tour O
de O
Nesle," O
with O
a O
motto O
in O
Spanish O
and O
French O
at O
the O
bottom. O
Through O
the O
sash-window O
a O
patch O
of O
dark O
sky O
was O
seen O
between O
the O
pointed O
roofs. O
She O
rose O
to O
light O
two O
wax-candles O
on O
the O
drawers, O
then O
she O
sat O
down O
again. O
"Well!" Quotation
said Cue
Leon. Entity
"Well!" Quotation
she Entity
replied. Cue
He O
was O
thinking O
how O
to O
resume O
the O
interrupted O
conversation, O
when O
she Entity
said Cue
to O
him-- Entity
"How Quotation
is Quotation
it Quotation
that Quotation
no Quotation
one Quotation
until Quotation
now Quotation
has Quotation
ever Quotation
expressed Quotation
such Quotation
sentiments Quotation
to Quotation
me?" Quotation
The Entity
clerk Entity
said Cue
that Quotation
ideal Quotation
natures Quotation
were Quotation
difficult Quotation
to Quotation
understand. Quotation
He O
from O
the O
first O
moment O
had O
loved O
her, O
and O
he O
despaired O
when O
he O
thought O
of O
the O
happiness O
that O
would O
have O
been O
theirs, O
if O
thanks O
to O
fortune, O
meeting O
her O
earlier, O
they O
had O
been O
indissolubly O
bound O
to O
one O
another. O
"I Quotation
have Quotation
sometimes Quotation
thought Quotation
of Quotation
it," Quotation
she Entity
went Cue
on. Cue
"What Quotation
a Quotation
dream!" Quotation
murmured Cue
Leon. Entity
And O
fingering O
gently O
the O
blue O
binding O
of O
her O
long O
white O
sash, O
he Entity
added, Cue
"And Quotation
who Quotation
prevents Quotation
us Quotation
from Quotation
beginning Quotation
now?" Quotation
"No, Quotation
my Quotation
friend," Quotation
she Entity
replied; Cue
"I Quotation
am Quotation
too Quotation
old; Quotation
you Quotation
are Quotation
too Quotation
young. Quotation
Forget Quotation
me! Quotation
Others Quotation
will Quotation
love Quotation
you; Quotation
you Quotation
will Quotation
love Quotation
them." Quotation
"Not Quotation
as Quotation
you!" Quotation
he Entity
cried. Cue
"What Quotation
a Quotation
child Quotation
you Quotation
are! Quotation
Come, Quotation
let Quotation
us Quotation
be Quotation
sensible. Quotation
I Quotation
wish Quotation
it." Quotation
She Entity
showed O
him O
the O
impossibility O
of O
their O
love, O
and O
that O
they O
must O
remain, O
as O
formerly, O
on O
the O
simple O
terms O
of O
a O
fraternal O
friendship. O
Was O
she O
speaking O
thus O
seriously? O
No O
doubt O
Emma Entity
did O
not O
herself O
know, O
quite O
absorbed O
as O
she O
was O
by O
the O
charm O
of O
the O
seduction, O
and O
the O
necessity O
of O
defending O
herself O
from O
it; O
and O
contemplating O
the O
young O
man O
with O
a O
moved O
look, O
she O
gently O
repulsed O
the O
timid O
caresses O
that O
his O
trembling O
hands O
attempted. O
"Ah! Quotation
forgive Quotation
me!" Quotation
he Entity
cried, Cue
drawing O
back. O
Emma O
was O
seized O
with O
a O
vague O
fear O
at O
this O
shyness, O
more O
dangerous O
to O
her O
than O
the O
boldness O
of O
Rodolphe O
when O
he O
advanced O
to O
her O
open-armed. O
No O
man O
had O
ever O
seemed O
to O
her O
so O
beautiful. O
An O
exquisite O
candour O
emanated O
from O
his O
being. O
He O
lowered O
his O
long O
fine O
eyelashes, O
that O
curled O
upwards. O
His O
cheek, O
with O
the O
soft O
skin O
reddened, O
she O
thought, O
with O
desire O
of O
her O
person, O
and O
Emma O
felt O
an O
invincible O
longing O
to O
press O
her O
lips O
to O
it. O
Then, O
leaning O
towards O
the O
clock O
as O
if O
to O
see O
the O
time-- O
"Ah! Quotation
how Quotation
late Quotation
it Quotation
is!" Quotation
she Entity
said; Cue
"how Quotation
we Quotation
do Quotation
chatter!" Quotation
He Entity
understood O
the O
hint O
and O
took O
up O
his O
hat. O
"It Quotation
has Quotation
even Quotation
made Quotation
me Quotation
forget Quotation
the Quotation
theatre. Quotation
And Quotation
poor Quotation
Bovary Quotation
has Quotation
left Quotation
me Quotation
here Quotation
especially Quotation
for Quotation
that. Quotation
Monsieur Quotation
Lormeaux, Quotation
of Quotation
the Quotation
Rue Quotation
Grand-Pont, Quotation
was Quotation
to Quotation
take Quotation
me Quotation
and Quotation
his Quotation
wife." Quotation
And O
the O
opportunity O
was O
lost, O
as O
she Entity
was O
to O
leave O
the O
next O
day. O
"Really!" Quotation
said Cue
Leon. Entity
"Yes." Quotation
"But Quotation
I Quotation
must Quotation
see Quotation
you Quotation
again," Quotation
he Entity
went Cue
on. Cue
"I Quotation
wanted Quotation
to Quotation
tell Quotation
you Quotation
-- Quotation
" Quotation
"What?" Quotation
"Something-- Quotation
important-- Quotation
serious. Quotation
Oh, Quotation
no! Quotation
Besides, Quotation
you Quotation
will Quotation
not Quotation
go; Quotation
it Quotation
is Quotation
impossible. Quotation
If Quotation
you Quotation
should-- Quotation
listen Quotation
to Quotation
me. Quotation
Then Quotation
you Quotation
have Quotation
not Quotation
understood Quotation
me; Quotation
you Quotation
have Quotation
not Quotation
guessed Quotation
-- Quotation
" Quotation
"Yet Quotation
you Quotation
speak Quotation
plainly," Quotation
said Cue
Emma. Entity
"Ah! Quotation
you Quotation
can Quotation
jest. Quotation
Enough! Quotation
enough! Quotation
Oh, Quotation
for Quotation
pity's Quotation
sake, Quotation
let Quotation
me Quotation
see Quotation
you Quotation
once-- Quotation
only Quotation
once!" Quotation
"Well Quotation
-- Quotation
" Quotation
She Entity
stopped; O
then, O
as O
if O
thinking O
better O
of O
it, O
"Oh, Quotation
not Quotation
here!" Quotation
"Where Quotation
you Quotation
will." Quotation
"Will Quotation
you Quotation
-- Quotation
" Quotation
She Entity
seemed O
to O
reflect; O
then O
abruptly, O
"To-morrow Quotation
at Quotation
eleven Quotation
o'clock Quotation
in Quotation
the Quotation
cathedral." Quotation
"I Quotation
shall Quotation
be Quotation
there," Quotation
he Entity
cried, Cue
seizing O
her Entity
hands, O
which O
she O
disengaged. O
And O
as O
they O
were O
both O
standing O
up, O
he O
behind O
her, O
and O
Emma O
with O
her O
head O
bent, O
he O
stooped O
over O
her O
and O
pressed O
long O
kisses O
on O
her O
neck. O
"You Quotation
are Quotation
mad! Quotation
Ah! Quotation
you Quotation
are Quotation
mad!" Quotation
she Entity
said, Cue
with O
sounding O
little O
laughs, O
while O
the O
kisses O
multiplied. O
Then O
bending O
his O
head O
over O
her O
shoulder, O
he O
seemed O
to O
beg O
the O
consent O
of O
her O
eyes. O
They O
fell O
upon O
him O
full O
of O
an O
icy O
dignity. O
Leon O
stepped O
back O
to O
go O
out. O
He O
stopped O
on O
the O
threshold; O
then O
he Entity
whispered Cue
with O
a O
trembling O
voice, O
"Tomorrow!" Quotation
She Entity
answered O
with O
a O
nod, O
and O
disappeared O
like O
a O
bird O
into O
the O
next O
room. O
In O
the O
evening O
Emma O
wrote O
the O
clerk O
an O
interminable O
letter, O
in O
which O
she O
cancelled O
the O
rendezvous; O
all O
was O
over; O
they O
must O
not, O
for O
the O
sake O
of O
their O
happiness, O
meet O
again. O
But O
when O
the O
letter O
was O
finished, O
as O
she O
did O
not O
know O
Leon's Entity
address, O
she O
was O
puzzled. O
"I'll Quotation
give Quotation
it Quotation
to Quotation
him Quotation
myself," Quotation
she Entity
said; Cue
"he Quotation
will Quotation
come." Quotation
The O
next O
morning, O
at O
the O
open O
window, O
and O
humming O
on O
his O
balcony, O
Leon O
himself O
varnished O
his O
pumps O
with O
several O
coatings. O
He O
put O
on O
white O
trousers, O
fine O
socks, O
a O
green O
coat, O
emptied O
all O
the O
scent O
he O
had O
into O
his O
handkerchief, O
then O
having O
had O
his O
hair O
curled, O
he O
uncurled O
it O
again, O
in O
order O
to O
give O
it O
a O
more O
natural O
elegance. O
"It O
is O
still O
too O
early," O
he O
thought, O
looking O
at O
the O
hairdresser's O
cuckoo-clock, O
that O
pointed O
to O
the O
hour O
of O
nine. O
He O
read O
an O
old O
fashion O
journal, O
went O
out, O
smoked O
a O
cigar, O
walked O
up O
three O
streets, O
thought O
it O
was O
time, O
and O
went O
slowly O
towards O
the O
porch O
of O
Notre O
Dame. O
It O
was O
a O
beautiful O
summer O
morning. O
Silver O
plate O
sparkled O
in O
the O
jeweller's O
windows, O
and O
the O
light O
falling O
obliquely O
on O
the O
cathedral O
made O
mirrors O
of O
the O
corners O
of O
the O
grey O
stones; O
a O
flock O
of O
birds O
fluttered O
in O
the O
grey O
sky O
round O
the O
trefoil O
bell-turrets; O
the O
square, O
resounding O
with O
cries, O
was O
fragrant O
with O
the O
flowers O
that O
bordered O
its O
pavement, O
roses, O
jasmines, O
pinks, O
narcissi, O
and O
tube-roses, O
unevenly O
spaced O
out O
between O
moist O
grasses, O
catmint, O
and O
chickweed O
for O
the O
birds; O
the O
fountains O
gurgled O
in O
the O
centre, O
and O
under O
large O
umbrellas, O
amidst O
melons, O
piled O
up O
in O
heaps, O
flower-women, O
bare-headed, O
were O
twisting O
paper O
round O
bunches O
of O
violets. O
The O
young O
man O
took O
one. O
It O
was O
the O
first O
time O
that O
he O
had O
bought O
flowers O
for O
a O
woman, O
and O
his O
breast, O
as O
he O
smelt O
them, O
swelled O
with O
pride, O
as O
if O
this O
homage O
that O
he O
meant O
for O
another O
had O
recoiled O
upon O
himself. O
But O
he O
was O
afraid O
of O
being O
seen; O
he O
resolutely O
entered O
the O
church. O
The O
beadle, O
who O
was O
just O
then O
standing O
on O
the O
threshold O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
left O
doorway, O
under O
the O
"Dancing O
Marianne," O
with O
feather O
cap, O
and O
rapier O
dangling O
against O
his O
calves, O
came O
in, O
more O
majestic O
than O
a O
cardinal, O
and O
as O
shining O
as O
a O
saint O
on O
a O
holy O
pyx. O
He Entity
came O
towards O
Leon, Entity
and, O
with O
that O
smile O
of O
wheedling O
benignity O
assumed O
by O
ecclesiastics O
when O
they O
question O
children-- O
"The Quotation
gentleman, Quotation
no Quotation
doubt, Quotation
does Quotation
not Quotation
belong Quotation
to Quotation
these Quotation
parts? Quotation
The Quotation
gentleman Quotation
would Quotation
like Quotation
to Quotation
see Quotation
the Quotation
curiosities Quotation
of Quotation
the Quotation
church?" Quotation
"No!" Quotation
said Cue
the Entity
other. Entity
And O
he O
first O
went O
round O
the O
lower O
aisles. O
Then O
he O
went O
out O
to O
look O
at O
the O
Place. O
Emma O
was O
not O
coming O
yet. O
He O
went O
up O
again O
to O
the O
choir. O
The O
nave O
was O
reflected O
in O
the O
full O
fonts O
with O
the O
beginning O
of O
the O
arches O
and O
some O
portions O
of O
the O
glass O
windows. O
But O
the O
reflections O
of O
the O
paintings, O
broken O
by O
the O
marble O
rim, O
were O
continued O
farther O
on O
upon O
the O
flag-stones, O
like O
a O
many-coloured O
carpet. O
The O
broad O
daylight O
from O
without O
streamed O
into O
the O
church O
in O
three O
enormous O
rays O
from O
the O
three O
opened O
portals. O
From O
time O
to O
time O
at O
the O
upper O
end O
a O
sacristan O
passed, O
making O
the O
oblique O
genuflexion O
of O
devout O
persons O
in O
a O
hurry. O
The O
crystal O
lustres O
hung O
motionless. O
In O
the O
choir O
a O
silver O
lamp O
was O
burning, O
and O
from O
the O
side O
chapels O
and O
dark O
places O
of O
the O
church O
sometimes O
rose O
sounds O
like O
sighs, O
with O
the O
clang O
of O
a O
closing O
grating, O
its O
echo O
reverberating O
under O
the O
lofty O
vault. O
Leon O
with O
solemn O
steps O
walked O
along O
by O
the O
walls. O
Life O
had O
never O
seemed O
so O
good O
to O
him. O
She O
would O
come O
directly, O
charming, O
agitated, O
looking O
back O
at O
the O
glances O
that O
followed O
her, O
and O
with O
her O
flounced O
dress, O
her O
gold O
eyeglass, O
her O
thin O
shoes, O
with O
all O
sorts O
of O
elegant O
trifles O
that O
he O
had O
never O
enjoyed, O
and O
with O
the O
ineffable O
seduction O
of O
yielding O
virtue. O
The O
church O
like O
a O
huge O
boudoir O
spread O
around O
her; O
the O
arches O
bent O
down O
to O
gather O
in O
the O
shade O
the O
confession O
of O
her O
love; O
the O
windows O
shone O
resplendent O
to O
illumine O
her O
face, O
and O
the O
censers O
would O
burn O
that O
she O
might O
appear O
like O
an O
angel O
amid O
the O
fumes O
of O
the O
sweet-smelling O
odours. O
But O
she O
did O
not O
come. O
He O
sat O
down O
on O
a O
chair, O
and O
his O
eyes O
fell O
upon O
a O
blue O
stained O
window O
representing O
boatmen O
carrying O
baskets. O
He O
looked O
at O
it O
long, O
attentively, O
and O
he O
counted O
the O
scales O
of O
the O
fishes O
and O
the O
button-holes O
of O
the O
doublets, O
while O
his O
thoughts O
wandered O
off O
towards O
Emma. O
The O
beadle, O
standing O
aloof, O
was O
inwardly O
angry O
at O
this O
individual O
who O
took O
the O
liberty O
of O
admiring O
the O
cathedral O
by O
himself. O
He O
seemed O
to O
him O
to O
be O
conducting O
himself O
in O
a O
monstrous O
fashion, O
to O
be O
robbing O
him O
in O
a O
sort, O
and O
almost O
committing O
sacrilege. O
But O
a O
rustle O
of O
silk O
on O
the O
flags, O
the O
tip O
of O
a O
bonnet, O
a O
lined O
cloak-- O
it O
was O
she! O
Leon O
rose O
and O
ran O
to O
meet O
her. O
Emma O
was O
pale. O
She O
walked O
fast. O
"Read!" Quotation
she Entity
said, Cue
holding O
out O
a O
paper O
to O
him. Entity
"Oh, Quotation
no!" Quotation
And O
she O
abruptly O
withdrew O
her O
hand O
to O
enter O
the O
chapel O
of O
the O
Virgin, O
where, O
kneeling O
on O
a O
chair, O
she O
began O
to O
pray. O
The O
young O
man O
was O
irritated O
at O
this O
bigot O
fancy; O
then O
he O
nevertheless O
experienced O
a O
certain O
charm O
in O
seeing O
her, O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
a O
rendezvous, O
thus O
lost O
in O
her O
devotions, O
like O
an O
Andalusian O
marchioness; O
then O
he O
grew O
bored, O
for O
she O
seemed O
never O
coming O
to O
an O
end. O
Emma O
prayed, O
or O
rather O
strove O
to O
pray, O
hoping O
that O
some O
sudden O
resolution O
might O
descend O
to O
her O
from O
heaven; O
and O
to O
draw O
down O
divine O
aid O
she O
filled O
full O
her O
eyes O
with O
the O
splendours O
of O
the O
tabernacle. O
She O
breathed O
in O
the O
perfumes O
of O
the O
full-blown O
flowers O
in O
the O
large O
vases, O
and O
listened O
to O
the O
stillness O
of O
the O
church, O
that O
only O
heightened O
the O
tumult O
of O
her O
heart. O
She Entity
rose, O
and O
they O
were O
about O
to O
leave, O
when O
the Entity
beadle Entity
came O
forward, O
hurriedly O
saying-- Cue
"Madame, Quotation
no Quotation
doubt, Quotation
does Quotation
not Quotation
belong Quotation
to Quotation
these Quotation
parts? Quotation
Madame Quotation
would Quotation
like Quotation
to Quotation
see Quotation
the Quotation
curiosities Quotation
of Quotation

church?" Quotation
"Oh, Quotation
no!" Quotation
cried Cue
the Entity
clerk. Entity
"Why Quotation
not?" Quotation
said Cue
she. Entity
For O
she O
clung O
with O
her O
expiring O
virtue O
to O
the O
Virgin, O
the O
sculptures, O
the O
tombs-- O
anything. O
Then, O
in O
order O
to O
proceed O
"by O
rule," O
the O
beadle O
conducted O
them Entity
right O
to O
the O
entrance O
near O
the O
square, O
where, O
pointing O
out O
with O
his O
cane O
a O
large O
circle O
of O
block-stones O
without O
inscription O
or O
carving-- O
"This," Quotation
he Entity
said Cue
majestically, O
"is Quotation
the Quotation
circumference Quotation

the Quotation
beautiful Quotation

-- Quotation
" Quotation
"Let Quotation
us Quotation
go Quotation
on," Quotation
said Cue
Leon. Entity
The Entity
old Entity
fellow Entity
started O
off O
again; O
then, O
having O
got O
back O
to O
the O
chapel O
of O
the O
Virgin, O
he O
stretched O
forth O
his O
arm O
with O
an O
all-embracing O
gesture O
of O
demonstration, O
and, O
prouder O
than O
a O
country O
squire O
showing O
you O
his O
espaliers, O
went Cue
on-- Cue

Madame O
Bovary O
put O
up O
her O

Leon, O
motionless, O
looked O
at O
her, O
no O
longer O
even O
attempting O
to O
speak O
a O

to O

THE Entity

WENT Cue
ON-- Cue
"Near Quotation
him, Quotation
this Quotation

Now Quotation
turn Quotation
to Quotation
this Quotation
side; Quotation
here Quotation
are Quotation
the Quotation
tombs Quotation
of Quotation
the Quotation
Ambroise. Quotation
They Quotation
were Quotation
both Quotation
cardinals Quotation
and Quotation
archbishops Quotation
of Quotation
Rouen. Quotation
That Quotation
one Quotation
was Quotation
minister Quotation
under Quotation

He Quotation
did Quotation
a Quotation
great Quotation

In Quotation
his Quotation

And O
without O
stopping, O
still O
talking, O
he O
pushed O
them Entity
into O
a O
chapel O
full O
of O
balustrades, O
some O
put O
away, O
and O
disclosed O
a O
kind O
of O
block O
that O
certainly O
might O
once O
have O
been O
an O
ill-made O
statue. O
"Truly," Quotation
he Entity
said Cue
with O
a O
groan, O
"it Quotation
adorned Quotation
the Quotation
tomb Quotation
of Quotation
Richard Quotation
Coeur Quotation
de Quotation
Lion, Quotation
King Quotation

It Quotation
was Quotation
the Quotation

reduced Quotation
it Quotation

They Quotation

under Quotation

But O
Leon O
hastily O
took O
some O
silver O
from O
his O
pocket O
and O
seized O
Emma's O
arm. O
The O
beadle O
stood O
dumfounded, O
not O
able O
to O
understand O
this O
untimely O
munificence O
when O
there O
were O
still O
so O
many O
things O
for O
the O
stranger O
to O
see. O
So O
calling O
him O
back, O
he Entity
cried-- Cue
"Sir! Quotation
sir! Quotation
The Quotation
steeple! Quotation
the Quotation
steeple!" Quotation
"No, Quotation
thank Quotation
you!" Quotation
said Cue
Leon. Entity
"You Quotation
are Quotation
wrong, Quotation
sir! Quotation

four Quotation
hundred Quotation
and Quotation
forty Quotation
feet Quotation
high, Quotation
nine Quotation
less Quotation
than Quotation
the Quotation
great Quotation
pyramid Quotation
of Quotation
Egypt. Quotation
It Quotation
is Quotation
all Quotation
cast; Quotation
it Quotation
-- Quotation
" Quotation
Leon Entity
was O
fleeing, O
for O
it O
seemed O
to O
him O
that O
his O
love, O
that O
for O
nearly O
two O
hours O
now O
had O
become O
petrified O
in O
the O
church O
like O
the O
stones, O
would O
vanish O
like O
a O
vapour O
through O
that O
sort O
of O
truncated O
funnel, O
of O
oblong O
cage, O
of O
open O
chimney O
that O
rises O
so O
grotesquely O
from O
the O
cathedral O
like O
the O
extravagant O
attempt O
of O
some O
fantastic O
brazier. O
"But Quotation
where Quotation
are Quotation
we Quotation
going?" Quotation
she Entity
said. Cue
Making O
no O
answer, O
he O
walked O
on O
with O
a O
rapid O
step; O
and O
Madame O
Bovary O
was O
already, O
dipping O
her O
finger O
in O
the O
holy O
water O
when O
behind O
them O
they O
heard O
a O
panting O
breath O
interrupted O
by O
the O
regular O
sound O
of O
a O
cane. O
Leon Entity
turned O
back. O
"Sir!" Quotation
"What Quotation
is Quotation
it?" Quotation
And O
he O
recognised O
the Entity
beadle, Entity
holding O
under O
his O
arms O
and O
balancing O
against O
his O
stomach O
some O
twenty O
large O
sewn O
volumes. O
They O
were O
works O
"which O
treated O
of O
the O
cathedral." O
"Idiot!" Quotation
growled Cue
Leon, Entity
rushing O
out O
of O
the O
church. O
A Entity
lad Entity
was O
playing O
about O
the O
close. O
"Go Quotation
and Quotation
get Quotation
me Quotation
a Quotation
cab!" Quotation
The O
child O
bounded O
off O
like O
a O
ball O
by O
the O
Rue O
Quatre-Vents; O
then O
they O
were O
alone O
a O
few O
minutes, O
face O
to O
face, O
and O
a O
little O
embarrassed. O
"Ah! Quotation
Leon! Quotation
Really Quotation
-- Quotation
I Quotation
don't Quotation
know-- Quotation
if Quotation
I Quotation
ought," Quotation
she Entity
whispered. Cue
Then O
with O
a O
more O
serious O
air, O
"Do Quotation
you Quotation
know, Quotation
it Quotation
is Quotation
very Quotation
improper Quotation
-- Quotation
" Quotation
"How Quotation
so?" Quotation
replied Cue
the Entity
clerk. Entity
"It Quotation
is Quotation
done Quotation
at Quotation
Paris." Quotation
And O
that, O
as O
an O
irresistible O
argument, O
decided O
her. O
Still O
the O
cab O
did O
not O
come. O
Leon Entity
was O
afraid O
she O
might O
go O
back O
into O
the O
church. O
At O
last O
the O
cab O
appeared. O
"At Quotation
all Quotation
events, Quotation
go Quotation
out Quotation
by Quotation
the Quotation
north Quotation
porch," Quotation
cried Cue
the Entity
beadle, Entity
who O
was O
left O
alone O
on O
the O
threshold, O
"so Quotation
as Quotation
to Quotation
see Quotation
the Quotation
Resurrection, Quotation
the Quotation
Last Quotation
Judgment, Quotation
Paradise, Quotation
King Quotation
David, Quotation
and Quotation
the Quotation
Condemned Quotation
in Quotation
Hell-flames." Quotation
"Where Quotation
to, Quotation
sir?" Quotation
asked Cue
the Entity
coachman. Entity
"Where Quotation
you Quotation
like," Quotation
said Cue
Leon, Entity
forcing O
Emma O
into O
the O
cab. O
And O
the O
lumbering O
machine O
set O
out. O
It O
went O
down O
the O
Rue O
Grand-Pont, O
crossed O
the O
Place O
des O
Arts, O
the O
Quai O
Napoleon, O
the O
Pont O
Neuf, O
and O
stopped O
short O
before O
the O
statue O
of O
Pierre O
Corneille. O
"Go Quotation
on," Quotation
cried Cue
a Entity
voice Entity
that O
came O
from O
within. O
The O
cab O
went O
on O
again, O
and O
as O
soon O
as O
it O
reached O
the O
Carrefour O
Lafayette, O
set O
off O
down-hill, O
and O
entered O
the O
station O
at O
a O
gallop. O
"No, Quotation
straight Quotation
on!" Quotation
cried Cue
the Entity
same Entity
voice. Entity
The O
cab O
came O
out O
by O
the O
gate, O
and O
soon O
having O
reached O
the O
Cours, O
trotted O
quietly O
beneath O
the O
elm-trees. O
The Entity
coachman Entity
wiped O
his O
brow, O
put O
his O
leather O
hat O
between O
his O
knees, O
and O
drove O
his O
carriage O
beyond O
the O
side O
alley O
by O
the O
meadow O
to O
the O
margin O
of O
the O
waters. O
It O
went O
along O
by O
the O
river, O
along O
the O
towing-path O
paved O
with O
sharp O
pebbles, O
and O
for O
a O
long O
while O
in O
the O
direction O
of O
Oyssel, O
beyond O
the O
isles. O
But O
suddenly O
it O
turned O
with O
a O
dash O
across O
Quatremares, O
Sotteville, O
La O
Grande-Chaussee, O
the O
Rue O
d'Elbeuf, O
and O
made O
its O
third O
halt O
in O
front O
of O
the O
Jardin O
des O
Plantes. O
"Get Quotation
on, Quotation
will Quotation
you?" Quotation
cried Cue
the Entity
voice Entity
more O
furiously. O
And O
at O
once O
resuming O
its O
course, O
it O
passed O
by O
Saint-Sever, O
by O
the O
Quai'des O
Curandiers, O
the O
Quai O
aux O
Meules, O
once O
more O
over O
the O
bridge, O
by O
the O
Place O
du O
Champ O
de O
Mars, O
and O
behind O
the O
hospital O
gardens, O
where O
old O
men O
in O
black O
coats O
were O
walking O
in O
the O
sun O
along O
the O
terrace O
all O
green O
with O
ivy. O
It O
went O
up O
the O
Boulevard O
Bouvreuil, O
along O
the O
Boulevard O
Cauchoise, O
then O
the O
whole O
of O
Mont-Riboudet O
to O
the O
Deville O
hills. O
It O
came O
back; O
and O
then, O
without O
any O
fixed O
plan O
or O
direction, O
wandered O
about O
at O
hazard. O
The O
cab O
was O
seen O
at O
Saint-Pol, O
at O
Lescure, O
at O
Mont O
Gargan, O
at O
La O
Rougue-Marc O
and O
Place O
du O
Gaillardbois; O
in O
the O
Rue O
Maladrerie, O
Rue O
Dinanderie, O
before O
Saint-Romain, O
Saint-Vivien, O
Saint-Maclou, O
Saint-Nicaise-- O
in O
front O
of O
the O
Customs, O
at O
the O
"Vieille O
Tour," O
the O
"Trois O
Pipes," O
and O
the O
Monumental O
Cemetery. O
From O
time O
to O
time O
the O
coachman, O
on O
his O
box O
cast O
despairing O
eyes O
at O
the O
public-houses. O
He O
could O
not O
understand O
what O
furious O
desire O
for O
locomotion O
urged O
these O
individuals O
never O
to O
wish O
to O
stop. O
He O
tried O
to O
now O
and O
then, O
and O
at O
once O
exclamations O
of O
anger O
burst O
forth O
behind O
him. O
Then O
he O
lashed O
his O
perspiring O
jades O
afresh, O
but O
indifferent O
to O
their O
jolting, O
running O
up O
against O
things O
here O
and O
there, O
not O
caring O
if O
he O
did, O
demoralised, O
and O
almost O
weeping O
with O
thirst, O
fatigue, O
and O
depression. O
And O
on O
the O
harbour, O
in O
the O
midst O
of O
the O
drays O
and O
casks, O
and O
in O
the O
streets, O
at O
the O
corners, O
the O
good O
folk O
opened O
large O
wonder-stricken O
eyes O
at O
this O
sight, O
so O
extraordinary O
in O
the O
provinces, O
a O
cab O
with O
blinds O
drawn, O
and O
which O
appeared O
thus O
constantly O
shut O
more O
closely O
than O
a O
tomb, O
and O
tossing O
about O
like O
a O
vessel. O
Once O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
day, O
in O
the O
open O
country, O
just O
as O
the O
sun O
beat O
most O
fiercely O
against O
the O
old O
plated O
lanterns, O
a O
bared O
hand O
passed O
beneath O
the O
small O
blinds O
of O
yellow O
canvas, O
and O
threw O
out O
some O
scraps O
of O
paper O
that O
scattered O
in O
the O
wind, O
and O
farther O
off O
lighted O
like O
white O
butterflies O
on O
a O
field O
of O
red O
clover O
all O
in O
bloom. O
At O
about O
six O
o'clock O
the O
carriage O
stopped O
in O
a O
back O
street O
of O
the O
Beauvoisine O
Quarter, O
and O
a O
woman O
got O
out, O
who O
walked O
with O
her O
veil O
down, O
and O
without O
turning O
her O
head. O
CHAPTER O
TWO O
On O
reaching O
the O
inn, O
Madame O
Bovary O
was O
surprised O
not O
to O
see O
the O
diligence. O
Hivert, O
who O
had O
waited O
for O
her O
fifty-three O
minutes, O
had O
at O
last O
started. O
Yet O
nothing O
forced O
her O
to O
go; O
but O
she O
had O
given O
her O
word O
that O
she O
would O
return O
that O
same O
evening. O
Moreover, O
Charles O
expected O
her, O
and O
in O
her O
heart O
she O
felt O
already O
that O
cowardly O
docility O
that O
is O
for O
some O
women O
at O
once O
the O
chastisement O
and O
atonement O
of O
adultery. O
She O
packed O
her O
box O
quickly, O
paid O
her O
bill, O
took O
a O
cab O
in O
the O
yard, O
hurrying O
on O
the O
driver, O
urging O
him O
on, O
every O
moment O
inquiring O
about O
the O
time O
and O
the O
miles O
traversed. O
He O
succeeded O
in O
catching O
up O
the O
"Hirondelle" O
as O
it O
neared O
the O
first O
houses O
of O
Quincampoix. O
Hardly O
was O
she Entity
seated O
in O
her O
corner O
than O
she O
closed O
her O
eyes, O
and O
opened O
them O
at O
the O
foot O
of O
the O
hill, O
when O
from O
afar O
she O
recognised O
Felicite, O
who O
was O
on O
the O
lookout O
in O
front O
of O
the O
farrier's O
shop. O
Hivert O
pulled O
in O
his O
horses O
and, O
the Entity
servant, Entity
climbing O
up O
to O
the O
window, O
said Cue
mysteriously-- O
"Madame, Quotation
you Quotation
must Quotation
go Quotation
at Quotation
once Quotation
to Quotation
Monsieur Quotation
Homais. Quotation
It's Quotation
for Quotation
something Quotation
important." Quotation
The O
village O
was O
silent O
as O
usual. O
At O
the O
corner O
of O
the O
streets O
were O
small O
pink O
heaps O
that O
smoked O
in O
the O
air, O
for O
this O
was O
the O
time O
for O
jam-making, O
and O
everyone O
at O
Yonville O
prepared O
his O
supply O
on O
the O
same O
day. O
But O
in O
front O
of O
the O
chemist's O
shop O
one O
might O
admire O
a O
far O
larger O
heap, O
and O
that O
surpassed O
the O
others O
with O
the O
superiority O
that O
a O
laboratory O
must O
have O
over O
ordinary O
stores, O
a O
general O
need O
over O
individual O
fancy. O
She O
went O
in. O
The O
large O
arm-chair O
was O
upset, O
and O
even O
the O
"Fanal O
de O
Rouen" O
lay O
on O
the O
ground, O
outspread O
between O
two O
pestles. O
She Entity
pushed O
open O
the O
lobby O
door, O
and O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
kitchen, O
amid O
brown O
jars O
full O
of O
picked O
currants, O
of O
powdered O
sugar O
and O
lump O
sugar, O
of O
the O
scales O
on O
the O
table, O
and O
of O
the O
pans O
on O
the O
fire, O
she O
saw O
all O
the O
Homais, O
small O
and O
large, O
with O
aprons O
reaching O
to O
their O
chins, O
and O
with O
forks O
in O
their O
hands. O
Justin Entity
was O
standing O
up O
with O
bowed O
head, O
and O
the Entity
chemist Entity
was O
screaming-- Cue
"Who Quotation
told Quotation
you Quotation
to Quotation
go Quotation
and Quotation
fetch Quotation
it Quotation
in Quotation
the Quotation
Capharnaum." Quotation
"What Quotation
is Quotation
it? Quotation
What Quotation
is Quotation
the Quotation
matter?" Quotation
"What Quotation
is Quotation
it?" Quotation
replied Cue
the Entity
druggist. Entity
"We Quotation
are Quotation
making Quotation
preserves; Quotation
they Quotation
are Quotation
simmering; Quotation
but Quotation
they Quotation
were Quotation
about Quotation
to Quotation
boil Quotation
over, Quotation
because Quotation
there Quotation
is Quotation
too Quotation
much Quotation
juice, Quotation
and Quotation
I Quotation
ordered Quotation
another Quotation
pan. Quotation
Then Quotation
he, Quotation
from Quotation
indolence, Quotation
from Quotation
laziness, Quotation
went Quotation
and Quotation
took, Quotation
hanging Quotation
on Quotation
its Quotation
nail Quotation
in Quotation
my Quotation
laboratory, Quotation
the Quotation
key Quotation
of Quotation
the Quotation
Capharnaum." Quotation
It O
was O
thus O
the O
druggist O
called O
a O
small O
room O
under O
the O
leads, O
full O
of O
the O
utensils O
and O
the O
goods O
of O
his O
trade. O
He O
often O
spent O
long O
hours O
there O
alone, O
labelling, O
decanting, O
and O
doing O
up O
again; O
and O
he O
looked O
upon O
it O
not O
as O
a O
simple O
store, O
but O
as O
a O
veritable O
sanctuary, O
whence O
there O
afterwards O
issued, O
elaborated O
by O
his O
hands, O
all O
sorts O
of O
pills, O
boluses, O
infusions, O
lotions, O
and O
potions, O
that O
would O
bear O
far O
and O
wide O
his O
celebrity. O
No O
one O
in O
the O
world O
set O
foot O
there, O
and O
he O
respected O
it O
so, O
that O
he O
swept O
it O
himself. O
Finally, O
if O
the O
pharmacy, O
open O
to O
all O
comers, O
was O
the O
spot O
where O
he O
displayed O
his O
pride, O
the O
Capharnaum O
was O
the O
refuge O
where, O
egoistically O
concentrating O
himself, O
Homais O
delighted O
in O
the O
exercise O
of O
his O
predilections, O
so O
that O
Justin's Entity
thoughtlessness O
seemed O
to O
him O
a O
monstrous O
piece O
of O
irreverence, O
and, O
redder O
than O
the O
currants, O
he Entity
repeated-- Cue
"Yes, Quotation
from Quotation
the Quotation
Capharnaum! Quotation
The Quotation
key Quotation
that Quotation
locks Quotation
up Quotation
the Quotation
acids Quotation
and Quotation
caustic Quotation
alkalies! Quotation
To Quotation
go Quotation
and Quotation

a Quotation

a Quotation

and Quotation
that Quotation
I Quotation

her O

"Arsenic! Quotation

Emma, Entity

Madame Entity

And O
seizing O
Justin Entity
by O
the O

he O

a O

out O

The Entity

stooped, O
but O
Homais O
was O
the O
quicker, O
and, O
having O
picked O
up O
the O
volume, O
contemplated O
it O
with O
staring O
eyes O
and O
open O
mouth. O
"CONJUGAL-- Quotation

he Entity
said, Cue
slowly O
separating O
the O
two O
words. O
"Ah! Quotation
very Quotation
good! Quotation
very Quotation
good! Quotation
very Quotation

And Quotation

Oh, Quotation
this Quotation

too Quotation
much!" Quotation
Madame Entity
Homais Entity
came O
forward. O
"No, Quotation

The Entity
children Entity
wanted O
to O
look O

"Leave Quotation
the Quotation

he Entity
said Cue
imperiously; O

they O
went O
out. O
First O
he O
walked O
up O

down O
with O
the O
open O
volume O
in O
his O
hand, O
rolling O
his O
eyes, O
choking, O
tumid, O
apoplectic. O
Then O
he Entity
came O
straight O
to O
his Entity
pupil, Entity
and, O
planting O
himself O
in O
front O
of O
him O
with O
crossed O
arms-- O
"Have Quotation
you Quotation
every Quotation
vice, Quotation
then, Quotation
little Quotation
wretch? Quotation
Take Quotation
care! Quotation
you Quotation
are Quotation
on Quotation
a Quotation
downward Quotation
path. Quotation
Did Quotation
not Quotation
you Quotation
reflect Quotation
that Quotation
this Quotation
infamous Quotation
book Quotation
might Quotation
fall Quotation
in Quotation
the Quotation
hands Quotation
of Quotation
my Quotation
children, Quotation

their Quotation

He Quotation

Are Quotation

anyhow, Quotation
that Quotation

Can Quotation
you Quotation

" Quotation
"But Quotation
really, Quotation

said Cue
Emma, Entity
"you Quotation
wished Quotation

" Quotation
"Ah, Quotation
yes! Quotation
madame. Quotation
Your Quotation
father-in-law Quotation
is Quotation
dead." Quotation
In O
fact, O
Monsieur O
Bovary O
senior O
had O
expired O
the O
evening O
before O
suddenly O
from O
an O
attack O
of O
apoplexy O
as O
he O
got O
up O
from O
table, O
and O
by O
way O
of O
greater O
precaution, O
on O
account O
of O
Emma's O
sensibility, O
Charles O
had O
begged O
Homais O
to O
break O
the O
horrible O
news O
to O
her O
gradually. O
Homais O
had O
thought O
over O
his O
speech; O
he O
had O
rounded, O
polished O
it, O
made O
it O
rhythmical; O
it O
was O
a O
masterpiece O
of O
prudence O
and O
transitions, O
of O
subtle O
turns O
and O
delicacy; O
but O
anger O
had O
got O
the O
better O
of O
rhetoric. O
Emma, O
giving O
up O
all O
chance O
of O
hearing O
any O
details, O
left O
the O
pharmacy; O
for O
Monsieur O
Homais O
had O
taken O
up O
the O
thread O
of O
his O
vituperations. O
However, O
he O
was O
growing O
calmer, O
and O
was O
now O
grumbling O
in O
a O
paternal O
tone O
whilst O
he Entity
fanned O
himself O
with O
his O
skull-cap. O
"It Quotation
is Quotation
not Quotation
that Quotation
I Quotation
entirely Quotation
disapprove Quotation
of Quotation
the Quotation
work. Quotation
Its Quotation
author Quotation
was Quotation
a Quotation
doctor! Quotation
There Quotation
are Quotation
certain Quotation
scientific Quotation
points Quotation
in Quotation
it Quotation
that Quotation
it Quotation
is Quotation
not Quotation
ill Quotation
a Quotation
man Quotation
should Quotation
know, Quotation
and Quotation
I Quotation
would Quotation
even Quotation
venture Quotation
to Quotation
say Quotation
that Quotation
a Quotation
man Quotation
must Quotation
know. Quotation
But Quotation
later-- Quotation
later! Quotation
At Quotation
any Quotation
rate, Quotation
not Quotation
till Quotation
you Quotation
are Quotation
man Quotation
yourself Quotation
and Quotation
your Quotation
temperament Quotation
is Quotation
formed." Quotation
When O
Emma O
knocked O
at O
the O
door. O
Charles, Entity
who O
was O
waiting O
for O
her, O
came O
forward O
with O
open O
arms O
and O
said Cue
to O
her Entity
with O
tears O
in O
his O
voice-- O
"Ah! Quotation
my Quotation
dear!" Quotation
And O
he O
bent O
over O
her O
gently O
to O
kiss O
her. O
But O
at O
the O
contact O
of O
his Entity
lips O
the O
memory O
of O
the O
other O
seized O
her, O
and O
she O
passed O
her O
hand O
over O
her O
face O
shuddering. O
But O
she Entity
made Cue
answer, Cue
"Yes, Quotation
I Quotation
know, Quotation
I Quotation
know!" Quotation
He O
showed O
her O
the O
letter O
in O
which O
his O
mother O
told O
the O
event O
without O
any O
sentimental O
hypocrisy. O
She O
only O
regretted O
her O
husband O
had O
not O
received O
the O
consolations O
of O
religion, O
as O
he O
had O
died O
at O
Daudeville, O
in O
the O
street, O
at O
the O
door O
of O
a O
cafe O
after O
a O
patriotic O
dinner O
with O
some O
ex-officers. O
Emma O
gave O
him O
back O
the O
letter; O
then O
at O
dinner, O
for O
appearance's O
sake, O
she O
affected O
a O
certain O
repugnance. O
But O
as O
he O
urged O
her O
to O
try, O
she O
resolutely O
began O
eating, O
while O
Charles O
opposite O
her O
sat O
motionless O
in O
a O
dejected O
attitude. O
Now O
and O
then O
he O
raised O
his O
head O
and O
gave O
her Entity
a O
long O
look O
full O
of O
distress. O
Once O
he Entity
sighed, Cue
"I Quotation
should Quotation
have Quotation
liked Quotation
to Quotation
see Quotation
him Quotation
again!" Quotation
She O
was O
silent. O
At O
last, O
understanding O
that O
she O
must O
say O
something, O
"How Quotation
old Quotation
was Quotation
your Quotation
father?" Quotation
she Entity
asked. Cue
"Fifty-eight." Quotation
"Ah!" Quotation
And O
that O
was O
all. O
A O
quarter O
of O
an O
hour O
after O
he Entity
added, Cue
"My Quotation
poor Quotation
mother! Quotation
what Quotation
will Quotation
become Quotation
of Quotation
her Quotation
now?" Quotation
She Entity
made O
a O
gesture O
that O
signified O
she O
did O
not O
know. O
Seeing O
her O
so O
taciturn, O
Charles O
imagined O
her O
much O
affected, O
and O
forced O
himself O
to O
say O
nothing, O
not O
to O
reawaken O
this O
sorrow O
which O
moved O
him. O
And, O
shaking O
off O
his O
own-- O
"Did Quotation
you Quotation
enjoy Quotation
yourself Quotation
yesterday?" Quotation
he Entity
asked. Cue
"Yes." Quotation
When O
the O
cloth O
was O
removed, O
Bovary O
did O
not O
rise, O
nor O
did O
Emma; O
and O
as O
she O
looked O
at O
him, O
the O
monotony O
of O
the O
spectacle O
drove O
little O
by O
little O
all O
pity O
from O
her O
heart. O
He O
seemed O
to O
her O
paltry, O
weak, O
a O
cipher-- O
in O
a O
word, O
a O
poor O
thing O
in O
every O
way. O
How O
to O
get O
rid O
of O
him? O
What O
an O
interminable O
evening! O
Something O
stupefying O
like O
the O
fumes O
of O
opium O
seized O
her. O
They O
heard O
in O
the O
passage O
the O
sharp O
noise O
of O
a O
wooden O
leg O
on O
the O
boards. O
It O
was O
Hippolyte O
bringing O
back O
Emma's O
luggage. O
In O
order O
to O
put O
it O
down O
he O
described O
painfully O
a O
quarter O
of O
a O
circle O
with O
his O
stump. O
"He O
doesn't O
even O
remember O
any O
more O
about O
it," O
she O
thought, O
looking O
at O
the O
poor O
devil, O
whose O
coarse O
red O
hair O
was O
wet O
with O
perspiration. O
Bovary O
was O
searching O
at O
the O
bottom O
of O
his O
purse O
for O
a O
centime, O
and O
without O
appearing O
to O
understand O
all O
there O
was O
of O
humiliation O
for O
him O
in O
the O
mere O
presence O
of O
this O
man, O
who O
stood O
there O
like O
a O
personified O
reproach O
to O
his O
incurable O
incapacity. O
"Hallo! Quotation
you've Quotation
a Quotation
pretty Quotation
bouquet," Quotation
he Entity
said, Cue
noticing O
Leon's O
violets O
on O
the O
chimney. O
"Yes," Quotation
she Entity
replied Cue
indifferently; O
"it's Quotation
a Quotation
bouquet Quotation
I Quotation
bought Quotation
just Quotation
now Quotation
from Quotation
a Quotation
beggar." Quotation
Charles O
picked O
up O
the O
flowers, O
and O
freshening O
his O
eyes, O
red O
with O
tears, O
against O
them, O
smelt O
them O
delicately. O
She O
took O
them O
quickly O
from O
his O
hand O
and O
put O
them O
in O
a O
glass O
of O
water. O
The O
next O
day O
Madame O
Bovary O
senior O
arrived. O
She O
and O
her O
son O
wept O
much. O
Emma, O
on O
the O
pretext O
of O
giving O
orders, O
disappeared. O
The O
following O
day O
they O
had O
a O
talk O
over O
the O
mourning. O
They O
went O
and O
sat O
down O
with O
their O
workboxes O
by O
the O
waterside O
under O
the O
arbour. O
Charles O
was O
thinking O
of O
his O
father, O
and O
was O
surprised O
to O
feel O
so O
much O
affection O
for O
this O
man, O
whom O
till O
then O
he O
had O
thought O
he O
cared O
little O
about. O
Madame O
Bovary O
senior O
was O
thinking O
of O
her O
husband. O
The O
worst O
days O
of O
the O
past O
seemed O
enviable O
to O
her. O
All O
was O
forgotten O
beneath O
the O
instinctive O
regret O
of O
such O
a O
long O
habit, O
and O
from O
time O
to O
time O
whilst O
she O
sewed, O
a O
big O
tear O
rolled O
along O
her O
nose O
and O
hung O
suspended O
there O
a O
moment. O
Emma O
was O
thinking O
that O
it O
was O
scarcely O
forty-eight O
hours O
since O
they O
had O
been O
together, O
far O
from O
the O
world, O
all O
in O
a O
frenzy O
of O
joy, O
and O
not O
having O
eyes O
enough O
to O
gaze O
upon O
each O
other. O
She O
tried O
to O
recall O
the O
slightest O
details O
of O
that O
past O
day. O
But O
the O
presence O
of O
her O
husband O
and O
mother-in-law O
worried O
her. O
She O
would O
have O
liked O
to O
hear O
nothing, O
to O
see O
nothing, O
so O
as O
not O
to O
disturb O
the O
meditation O
on O
her O
love, O
that, O
do O
what O
she O
would, O
became O
lost O
in O
external O
sensations. O
She O
was O
unpicking O
the O
lining O
of O
a O
dress, O
and O
the O
strips O
were O
scattered O
around O
her. O
Madame O
Bovary O
senior O
was O
plying O
her O
scissor O
without O
looking O
up, O
and O
Charles, O
in O
his O
list O
slippers O
and O
his O
old O
brown O
surtout O
that O
he O
used O
as O
a O
dressing-gown, O
sat O
with O
both O
hands O
in O
his O
pockets, O
and O
did O
not O
speak O
either; O
near O
them O
Berthe, O
in O
a O
little O
white O
pinafore, O
was O
raking O
sand O
in O
the O
walks O
with O
her O
spade. O
Suddenly O
she O
saw O
Monsieur O
Lheureux, O
the O
linendraper, O
come O
in O
through O
the O
gate. O
He Entity
came O
to O
offer O
his O
services O
"under Quotation
the Quotation
sad Quotation
circumstances." Quotation
Emma Entity
answered Cue
that Quotation
she Quotation
thought Quotation
she Quotation
could Quotation
do Quotation
without. Quotation
The O
shopkeeper O
was O
not O
to O
be O
beaten. O
"I Quotation
beg Quotation
your Quotation
pardon," Quotation
he Entity
said, Cue
"but Quotation
I Quotation
should Quotation
like Quotation
to Quotation
have Quotation
a Quotation
private Quotation
talk Quotation
with Quotation
you." Quotation
Then O
in O
a O
low O
voice, O
"It's Quotation
about Quotation
that Quotation
affair-- Quotation
you Quotation
know." Quotation
Charles Entity
crimsoned O
to O
his O
ears. O
"Oh, Quotation
yes! Quotation
certainly." Quotation
And O
in O
his O
confusion, O
turning O
to O
his Entity
wife, Entity
"Couldn't Quotation
you, Quotation
my Quotation
darling?" Quotation
She O
seemed O
to O
understand O
him, O
for O
she O
rose; O
and O
Charles Entity
said Cue
to O
his Entity
mother, Entity
"It Quotation
is Quotation
nothing Quotation
particular. Quotation
No Quotation
doubt, Quotation
some Quotation
household Quotation
trifle." Quotation
He O
did O
not O
want O
her O
to O
know O
the O
story O
of O
the O
bill, O
fearing O
her O
reproaches. O
As O
soon O
as O
they O
were O
alone, O
Monsieur Entity
Lheureux Entity
in O
sufficiently O
clear O
terms O
began O
to O
congratulate Cue
Emma Entity
on Quotation
the Quotation
inheritance, Quotation
then O
to O
talk Cue
of Quotation
indifferent Quotation
matters, Quotation
of Quotation
the Quotation
espaliers, Quotation
of Quotation
the Quotation
harvest, Quotation
and Quotation
of Quotation
his Quotation
own Quotation
health, Quotation
which Quotation
was Quotation
always Quotation
so-so, Quotation
always Quotation
having Quotation
ups Quotation
and Quotation
downs. Quotation
In O
fact, O
he O
had O
to O
work O
devilish O
hard, O
although O
he O
didn't O
make O
enough, O
in O
spite O
of O
all O
people O
said, O
to O
find O
butter O
for O
his O
bread. O
Emma O
let O
him O
talk O
on. O
She Entity
had O
bored O
herself O
so O
prodigiously O
the O
last O
two O
days. O
"And Quotation
so Quotation
you're Quotation
quite Quotation
well Quotation
again?" Quotation
he Entity
went Cue
on. Cue
"Ma Quotation
foi! Quotation
I Quotation
saw Quotation
your Quotation
husband Quotation
in Quotation
a Quotation
sad Quotation
state. Quotation
He's Quotation
a Quotation
good Quotation
fellow, Quotation
though Quotation
we Quotation
did Quotation
have Quotation
a Quotation
little Quotation
misunderstanding." Quotation
She Entity
asked Cue
what Quotation
misunderstanding, Quotation
for O
Charles O
had O
said O
nothing O
of O
the O
dispute O
about O
the O
goods O
supplied O
to O
her. O
"Why, Quotation
you Quotation
know Quotation
well Quotation
enough," Quotation
cried Cue
Lheureux. Entity
"It Quotation
was Quotation
about Quotation
your Quotation
little Quotation
fancies-- Quotation
the Quotation
travelling Quotation
trunks." Quotation
He O
had O
drawn O
his O
hat O
over O
his O
eyes, O
and, O
with O
his O
hands O
behind O
his O
back, O
smiling O
and O
whistling, O
he O
looked O
straight O
at O
her O
in O
an O
unbearable O
manner. O
Did O
he O
suspect O
anything? O
She Entity
was O
lost O
in O
all O
kinds O
of O
apprehensions. O
At O
last, O
however, O
he Entity
went Cue
on-- Cue
"We Quotation
made Quotation
it Quotation
up, Quotation
all Quotation
the Quotation
same, Quotation
and Quotation
I've Quotation
come Quotation
again Quotation
to Quotation
propose Quotation
another Quotation
arrangement." Quotation
This O
was O
to O
renew O
the O
bill O
Bovary O
had O
signed. O
The O
doctor, O
of O
course, O
would O
do O
as O
he O
pleased; O
he O
was O
not O
to O
trouble O
himself, O
especially O
just O
now, O
when O
he O
would O
have O
a O
lot O
of O
worry. O
"And Quotation
he Quotation
would Quotation
do Quotation
better Quotation
to Quotation
give Quotation
it Quotation
over Quotation
to Quotation
someone Quotation
else-- Quotation
to Quotation
you, Quotation
for Quotation
example. Quotation
With Quotation
a Quotation
power Quotation
of Quotation
attorney Quotation
it Quotation
could Quotation
be Quotation
easily Quotation
managed, Quotation
and Quotation
then Quotation
we Quotation
(you Quotation
and Quotation
I) Quotation
would Quotation
have Quotation
our Quotation
little Quotation
business Quotation
transactions Quotation
together." Quotation
She Entity
did O
not O
understand. O
He O
was O
silent. O
Then, O
passing O
to O
his O
trade, O
Lheureux Entity
declared Cue
that Quotation
madame Quotation
must Quotation
require Quotation
something. Quotation
He Quotation
would Quotation
send Quotation
her Quotation
a Quotation
black Quotation
barege, Quotation
twelve Quotation
yards, Quotation
just Quotation
enough Quotation
to Quotation
make Quotation
a Quotation
gown. Quotation
"The O
one O
you've O
on O
is O
good O
enough O
for O
the O
house, O
but O
you O
want O
another O
for O
calls. O
I O
saw O
that O
the O
very O
moment O
that O
I O
came O
in. O
I've O
the O
eye O
of O
an O
American!" O
He O
did O
not O
send O
the O
stuff; O
he O
brought O
it. O
Then O
he O
came O
again O
to O
measure O
it; O
he O
came O
again O
on O
other O
pretexts, O
always O
trying O
to O
make O
himself O
agreeable, O
useful, O
"enfeoffing O
himself," O
as O
Homais O
would O
have O
said, O
and O
always O
dropping O
some O
hint O
to O
Emma O
about O
the O
power O
of O
attorney. O
He O
never O
mentioned O
the O
bill; O
she O
did O
not O
think O
of O
it. O
Charles, O
at O
the O
beginning O
of O
her O
convalescence, O
had O
certainly O
said O
something O
about O
it O
to O
her, O
but O
so O
many O
emotions O
had O
passed O
through O
her O
head O
that O
she O
no O
longer O
remembered O
it. O
Besides, O
she O
took O
care O
not O
to O
talk O
of O
any O
money O
questions. O
Madame O
Bovary O
seemed O
surprised O
at O
this, O
and O
attributed O
the O
change O
in O
her O
ways O
to O
the O
religious O
sentiments O
she O
had O
contracted O
during O
her O
illness. O
But O
as O
soon O
as O
she O
was O
gone, O
Emma O
greatly O
astounded O
Bovary O
by O
her O
practical O
good O
sense. O
It O
would O
be O
necessary O
to O
make O
inquiries, O
to O
look O
into O
mortgages, O
and O
see O
if O
there O
were O
any O
occasion O
for O
a O
sale O
by O
auction O
or O
a O
liquidation. O
She O
quoted O
technical O
terms O
casually, O
pronounced O
the O
grand O
words O
of O
order, O
the O
future, O
foresight, O
and O
constantly O
exaggerated O
the O
difficulties O
of O
settling O
his O
father's O
affairs O
so O
much, O
that O
at O
last O
one O
day O
she O
showed O
him O
the O
rough O
draft O
of O
a O
power O
of O
attorney O
to O
manage O
and O
administer O
his O
business, O
arrange O
all O
loans, O
sign O
and O
endorse O
all O
bills, O
pay O
all O
sums, O
etc. O
She O
had O
profited O
by O
Lheureux's O
lessons. O
Charles O
naively O
asked O
her O
where O
this O
paper O
came O
from. O
"Monsieur O
Guillaumin"; O
and O
with O
the O
utmost O
coolness O
she O
added, O
"I O
don't O
trust O
him O
overmuch. O
Notaries O
have O
such O
a O
bad O
reputation. O
Perhaps O
we O
ought O
to O
consult-- O
we O
only O
know-- O
no O
one." O
"Unless O
Leon O
-- O
" O
replied O
Charles, O
who O
was O
reflecting. O
But O
it O
was O
difficult O
to O
explain O
matters O
by O
letter. O
Then O
she O
offered O
to O
make O
the O
journey, O
but O
he O
thanked O
her. O
She O
insisted. O
It O
was O
quite O
a O
contest O
of O
mutual O
consideration. O
At O
last O
she O
cried O
with O
affected O
waywardness-- O
"No, O
I O
will O
go!" O
"How O
good O
you O
are!" O
he O
said, O
kissing O
her O
forehead. O
The O
next O
morning O
she O
set O
out O
in O
the O
"Hirondelle" O
to O
go O
to O
Rouen O
to O
consult O
Monsieur O
Leon, O
and O
she O
stayed O
there O
three O
days. O
CHAPTER O
THREE O
They O
were O
three O
full, O
exquisite O
days O
-- O
a O
true O
honeymoon. O
They O
were O
at O
the O
Hotel-de-Boulogne, O
on O
the O
harbour; O
and O
they O
lived O
there, O
with O
drawn O
blinds O
and O
closed O
doors, O
with O
flowers O
on O
the O
floor, O
and O
iced O
syrups O
were O
brought O
them O
early O
in O
the O
morning. O
Towards O
evening O
they O
took O
a O
covered O
boat O
and O
went O
to O
dine O
on O
one O
of O
the O
islands. O
It O
was O
the O
time O
when O
one O
hears O
by O
the O
side O
of O
the O
dockyard O
the O
caulking-mallets O
sounding O
against O
the O
hull O
of O
vessels. O
The O
smoke O
of O
the O
tar O
rose O
up O
between O
the O
trees; O
there O
were O
large O
fatty O
drops O
on O
the O
water, O
undulating O
in O
the O
purple O
colour O
of O
the O
sun, O
like O
floating O
plaques O
of O
Florentine O
bronze. O
They O
rowed O
down O
in O
the O
midst O
of O
moored O
boats, O
whose O
long O
oblique O
cables O
grazed O
lightly O
against O
the O
bottom O
of O
the O
boat. O
The O
din O
of O
the O
town O
gradually O
grew O
distant; O
the O
rolling O
of O
carriages, O
the O
tumult O
of O
voices, O
the O
yelping O
of O
dogs O
on O
the O
decks O
of O
vessels. O
She O
took O
off O
her O
bonnet, O
and O
they O
landed O
on O
their O
island. O
They O
sat O
down O
in O
the O
low-ceilinged O
room O
of O
a O
tavern, O
at O
whose O
door O
hung O
black O
nets. O
They O
ate O
fried O
smelts, O
cream O
and O
cherries. O
They O
lay O
down O
upon O
the O
grass; O
they O
kissed O
behind O
the O
poplars; O
and O
they O
would O
fain, O
like O
two O
Robinsons, O
have O
lived O
for O
ever O
in O
this O
little O
place, O
which O
seemed O
to O
them O
in O
their O
beatitude O
the O
most O
magnificent O
on O
earth. O
It O
was O
not O
the O
first O
time O
that O
they O
had O
seen O
trees, O
a O
blue O
sky, O
meadows; O
that O
they O
had O
heard O
the O
water O
flowing O
and O
the O
wind O
blowing O
in O
the O
leaves; O
but, O
no O
doubt, O
they O
had O
never O
admired O
all O
this, O
as O
if O
Nature O
had O
not O
existed O
before, O
or O
had O
only O
begun O
to O
be O
beautiful O
since O
the O
gratification O
of O
their O
desires. O
At O
night O
they O
returned. O
The O
boat O
glided O
along O
the O
shores O
of O
the O
islands. O
They O
sat O
at O
the O
bottom, O
both O
hidden O
by O
the O
shade, O
in O
silence. O
The O
square O
oars O
rang O
in O
the O
iron O
thwarts, O
and, O
in O
the O
stillness, O
seemed O
to O
mark O
time, O
like O
the O
beating O
of O
a O
metronome, O
while O
at O
the O
stern O
the O
rudder O
that O
trailed O
behind O
never O
ceased O
its O
gentle O
splash O
against O
the O
water. O
Once O
the O
moon O
rose; O
they O
did O
not O
fail O
to O
make O
fine O
phrases, O
finding O
the O
orb O
melancholy O
and O
full O
of O
poetry. O
She O
even O
began O
to O
sing-- O
"One O
night, O
do O
you O
remember, O
we O
were O
sailing," O
etc. O
Her O
musical O
but O
weak O
voice O
died O
away O
along O
the O
waves, O
and O
the O
winds O
carried O
off O
the O
trills O
that O
Leon O
heard O
pass O
like O
the O
flapping O
of O
wings O
about O
him. O
She O
was O
opposite O
him, O
leaning O
against O
the O
partition O
of O
the O
shallop, O
through O
one O
of O
whose O
raised O
blinds O
the O
moon O
streamed O
in. O
Her O
black O
dress, O
whose O
drapery O
spread O
out O
like O
a O
fan, O
made O
her O
seem O
more O
slender, O
taller. O
Her O
head O
was O
raised, O
her O
hands O
clasped, O
her O
eyes O
turned O
towards O
heaven. O
At O
times O
the O
shadow O
of O
the O
willows O
hid O
her O
completely; O
then O
she O
reappeared O
suddenly, O
like O
a O
vision O
in O
the O
moonlight. O
Leon, O
on O
the O
floor O
by O
her O
side, O
found O
under O
his O
hand O
a O
ribbon O
of O
scarlet O
silk. O
The O
boatman O
looked O
at O
it, O
and O
at O
last O
said-- O
"Perhaps O
it O
belongs O
to O
the O
party O
I O
took O
out O
the O
other O
day. O
A O
lot O
of O
jolly O
folk, O
gentlemen O
and O
ladies, O
with O
cakes, O
champagne, O
cornets-- O
everything O
in O
style! O
There O
was O
one O
especially, O
a O
tall O
handsome O
man O
with O
small O
moustaches, O
who O
was O
that O
funny! O
And O
they O
all O
kept O
saying, O
'Now O
tell O
us O
something, O
Adolphe-- O
Dolpe,' O
I O
think." O
She O
shivered. O
"You O
are O
in O
pain?" O
asked O
Leon, O
coming O
closer O
to O
her. O
"Oh, O
it's O
nothing! O
No O
doubt, O
it O
is O
only O
the O
night O
air." O
"And O
who O
doesn't O
want O
for O
women, O
either," O
softly O
added O
the O
sailor, O
thinking O
he O
was O
paying O
the O
stranger O
a O
compliment. O
Then, O
spitting O
on O
his O
hands, O
he O
took O
the O
oars O
again. O
Yet O
they O
had O
to O
part. O
The O
adieux O
were O
sad. O
He O
was O
to O
send O
his O
letters O
to O
Mere O
Rollet, O
and O
she O
gave O
him O
such O
precise O
instructions O
about O
a O
double O
envelope O
that O
he O
admired O
greatly O
her O
amorous O
astuteness. O
"So O
you O
can O
assure O
me O
it O
is O
all O
right?" O
she O
said O
with O
her O
last O
kiss. O
"Yes, O
certainly." O
"But O
why," O
he O
thought O
afterwards O
as O
he O
came O
back O
through O
the O
streets O
alone, O
"is O
she O
so O
very O
anxious O
to O
get O
this O
power O
of O
attorney?" O
CHAPTER O
FOUR O
Leon O
soon O
put O
on O
an O
air O
of O
superiority O
before O
his O
comrades, O
avoided O
their O
company, O
and O
completely O
neglected O
his O
work. O
He O
waited O
for O
her O
letters; O
he O
re-read O
them; O
he O
wrote O
to O
her. O
He O
called O
her O
to O
mind O
with O
all O
the O
strength O
of O
his O
desires O
and O
of O
his O
memories. O
Instead O
of O
lessening O
with O
absence, O
this O
longing O
to O
see O
her O
again O
grew, O
so O
that O
at O
last O
on O
Saturday O
morning O
he O
escaped O
from O
his O
office. O
When, O
from O
the O
summit O
of O
the O
hill, O
he O
saw O
in O
the O
valley O
below O
the O
church-spire O
with O
its O
tin O
flag O
swinging O
in O
the O
wind, O
he O
felt O
that O
delight O
mingled O
with O
triumphant O
vanity O
and O
egoistic O
tenderness O
that O
millionaires O
must O
experience O
when O
they O
come O
back O
to O
their O
native O
village. O
He O
went O
rambling O
round O
her O
house. O
A O
light O
was O
burning O
in O
the O
kitchen. O
He O
watched O
for O
her O
shadow O
behind O
the O
curtains, O
but O
nothing O
appeared. O
Mere O
Lefrancois, O
when O
she O
saw O
him, O
uttered O
many O
exclamations. O
She O
thought O
he O
"had O
grown O
and O
was O
thinner," O
while O
Artemise, O
on O
the O
contrary, O
thought O
him O
stouter O
and O
darker. O
He O
dined O
in O
the O
little O
room O
as O
of O
yore, O
but O
alone, O
without O
the O
tax-gatherer; O
for O
Binet, O
tired O
of O
waiting O
for O
the O
"Hirondelle," O
had O
definitely O
put O
forward O
his O
meal O
one O
hour, O
and O
now O
he O
dined O
punctually O
at O
five, O
and O
yet O
he O
declared O
usually O
the O
rickety O
old O
concern O
"was O
late." O
Leon, O
however, O
made O
up O
his O
mind, O
and O
knocked O
at O
the O
doctor's O
door. O
Madame O
was O
in O
her O
room, O
and O
did O
not O
come O
down O
for O
a O
quarter O
of O
an O
hour. O
The O
doctor O
seemed O
delighted O
to O
see O
him, O
but O
he O
never O
stirred O
out O
that O
evening, O
nor O
all O
the O
next O
day. O
He O
saw O
her O
alone O
in O
the O
evening, O
very O
late, O
behind O
the O
garden O
in O
the O
lane; O
in O
the O
lane, O
as O
she O
had O
the O
other O
one! O
It O
was O
a O
stormy O
night, O
and O
they O
talked O
under O
an O
umbrella O
by O
lightning O
flashes. O
Their O
separation O
was O
becoming O
intolerable. O
"I O
would O
rather O
die!" O
said O
Emma. O
She O
was O
writhing O
in O
his O
arms, O
weeping. O
"Adieu! O
adieu! O
When O
shall O
I O
see O
you O
again?" O
They O
came O
back O
again O
to O
embrace O
once O
more, O
and O
it O
was O
then O
that O
she O
promised O
him O
to O
find O
soon, O
by O
no O
matter O
what O
means, O
a O
regular O
opportunity O
for O
seeing O
one O
another O
in O
freedom O
at O
least O
once O
a O
week. O
Emma O
never O
doubted O
she O
should O
be O
able O
to O
do O
this. O
Besides, O
she O
was O
full O
of O
hope. O
Some O
money O
was O
coming O
to O
her. O
On O
the O
strength O
of O
it O
she O
bought O
a O
pair O
of O
yellow O
curtains O
with O
large O
stripes O
for O
her O
room, O
whose O
cheapness O
Monsieur O
Lheureux O
had O
commended; O
she O
dreamed O
of O
getting O
a O
carpet, O
and O
Lheureux, O
declaring O
that O
it O
wasn't O
"drinking O
the O
sea," O
politely O
undertook O
to O
supply O
her O
with O
one. O
She O
could O
no O
longer O
do O
without O
his O
services. O
Twenty O
times O
a O
day O
she O
sent O
for O
him, O
and O
he O
at O
once O
put O
by O
his O
business O
without O
a O
murmur. O
People O
could O
not O
understand O
either O
why O
Mere O
Rollet O
breakfasted O
with O
her O
every O
day, O
and O
even O
paid O
her O
private O
visits. O
It O
was O
about O
this O
time, O
that O
is O
to O
say, O
the O
beginning O
of O
winter, O
that O
she O
seemed O
seized O
with O
great O
musical O
fervour. O
One O
evening O
when O
Charles O
was O
listening O
to O
her, O
she O
began O
the O
same O
piece O
four O
times O
over, O
each O
time O
with O
much O
vexation, O
while O
he, O
not O
noticing O
any O
difference, O
cried-- O
"Bravo! O
very O
goodl O
You O
are O
wrong O
to O
stop. O
Go O
on!" O
"Oh, O
no; O
it O
is O
execrable! O
My O
fingers O
are O
quite O
rusty." O
The O
next O
day O
he O
begged O
her O
to O
play O
him O
something O
again. O
"Very O
well; O
to O
please O
you!" O
And O
Charles O
confessed O
she O
had O
gone O
off O
a O
little. O
She O
played O
wrong O
notes O
and O
blundered; O
then, O
stopping O
short-- O
"Ah! O
it O
is O
no O
use. O
I O
ought O
to O
take O
some O
lessons; O
but O
-- O
" O
She O
bit O
her O
lips O
and O
added, O
"Twenty O
francs O
a O
lesson, O
that's O
too O
dear!" O
"Yes, O
so O
it O
is-- O
rather," O
said O
Charles, O
giggling O
stupidly. O
"But O
it O
seems O
to O
me O
that O
one O
might O
be O
able O
to O
do O
it O
for O
less; O
for O
there O
are O
artists O
of O
no O
reputation, O
and O
who O
are O
often O
better O
than O
the O
celebrities." O
"Find O
them!" O
said O
Emma. O
The O
next O
day O
when O
he O
came O
home O
he O
looked O
at O
her O
shyly, O
and O
at O
last O
could O
no O
longer O
keep O
back O
the O
words. O
"How O
obstinate O
you O
are O
sometimes! O
I O
went O
to O
Barfucheres O
to-day. O
Well, O
Madame O
Liegard O
assured O
me O
that O
her O
three O
young O
ladies O
who O
are O
at O
La O
Misericorde O
have O
lessons O
at O
fifty O
sous O
apiece, O
and O
that O
from O
an O
excellent O
mistress!" O
She O
shrugged O
her O
shoulders O
and O
did O
not O
open O
her O
piano O
again. O
But O
when O
she O
passed O
by O
it O
(if O
Bovary O
were O
there), O
she O
sighed-- O
"Ah! O
my O
poor O
piano!" O
And O
when O
anyone O
came O
to O
see O
her, O
she O
did O
not O
fail O
to O
inform O
them O
she O
had O
given O
up O
music, O
and O
could O
not O
begin O
again O
now O
for O
important O
reasons. O
THEN O
PEOPLE O
COMMISERATED O
HER-- O
"What O
a O
pity! O
she O
had O
so O
much O
talent!" O
They O
even O
spoke O
to O
Bovary O
about O
it. O
They O
put O
him O
to O
shame, O
and O
especially O
the O
chemist. O
"You O
are O
wrong. O
One O
should O
never O
let O
any O
of O
the O
faculties O
of O
nature O
lie O
fallow. O
Besides, O
just O
think, O
my O
good O
friend, O
that O
by O
inducing O
madame O
to O
study; O
you O
are O
economising O
on O
the O
subsequent O
musical O
education O
of O
your O
child. O
For O
my O
own O
part, O
I O
think O
that O
mothers O
ought O
themselves O
to O
instruct O
their O
children. O
That O
is O
an O
idea O
of O
Rousseau's, O
still O
rather O
new O
perhaps, O
but O
that O
will O
end O
by O
triumphing, O
I O
am O
certain O
of O
it, O
like O
mothers O
nursing O
their O
own O
children O
and O
vaccination." O
So O
Charles O
returned O
once O
more O
to O
this O
question O
of O
the O
piano. O
Emma O
replied O
bitterly O
that O
it O
would O
be O
better O
to O
sell O
it. O
This O
poor O
piano, O
that O
had O
given O
her O
vanity O
so O
much O
satisfaction-- O
to O
see O
it O
go O
was O
to O
Bovary O
like O
the O
indefinable O
suicide O
of O
a O
part O
of O
herself. O
"If O
you O
liked," O
he O
said, O
"a O
lesson O
from O
time O
to O
time, O
that O
wouldn't O
after O
all O
be O
very O
ruinous." O
"But O
lessons," O
she O
replied, O
"are O
only O
of O
use O
when O
followed O
up." O
And O
thus O
it O
was O
she O
set O
about O
obtaining O
her O
husband's O
permission O
to O
go O
to O
town O
once O
a O
week O
to O
see O
her O
lover. O
At O
the O
end O
of O
a O
month O
she O
was O
even O
considered O
to O
have O
made O
considerable O
progress. O
CHAPTER O
FIVE O
She O
went O
on O
Thursdays. O
She O
got O
up O
and O
dressed O
silently, O
in O
order O
not O
to O
awaken O
Charles, O
who O
would O
have O
made O
remarks O
about O
her O
getting O
ready O
too O
early. O
Next O
she O
walked O
up O
and O
down, O
went O
to O
the O
windows, O
and O
looked O
out O
at O
the O
Place. O
The O
early O
dawn O
was O
broadening O
between O
the O
pillars O
of O
the O
market, O
and O
the O
chemist's O
shop, O
with O
the O
shutters O
still O
up, O
showed O
in O
the O
pale O
light O
of O
the O
dawn O
the O
large O
letters O
of O
his O
signboard. O
When O
the O
clock O
pointed O
to O
a O
quarter O
past O
seven, O
she O
went O
off O
to O
the O
"Lion O
d'Or," O
whose O
door O
Artemise O
opened O
yawning. O
The O
girl O
then O
made O
up O
the O
coals O
covered O
by O
the O
cinders, O
and O
Emma O
remained O
alone O
in O
the O
kitchen. O
Now O
and O
again O
she O
went O
out. O
Hivert O
was O
leisurely O
harnessing O
his O
horses, O
listening, O
moreover, O
to O
Mere O
Lefrancois, O
who, O
passing O
her O
head O
and O
nightcap O
through O
a O
grating, O
was O
charging O
him O
with O
commissions O
and O
giving O
him O
explanations O
that O
would O
have O
confused O
anyone O
else. O
Emma O
kept O
beating O
the O
soles O
of O
her O
boots O
against O
the O
pavement O
of O
the O
yard. O
At O
last, O
when O
he O
had O
eaten O
his O
soup, O
put O
on O
his O
cloak, O
lighted O
his O
pipe, O
and O
grasped O
his O
whip, O
he O
calmly O
installed O
himself O
on O
his O
seat. O
The O
"Hirondelle" O
started O
at O
a O
slow O
trot, O
and O
for O
about O
a O
mile O
stopped O
here O
and O
there O
to O
pick O
up O
passengers O
who O
waited O
for O
it, O
standing O
at O
the O
border O
of O
the O
road, O
in O
front O
of O
their O
yard O
gates. O
Those O
who O
had O
secured O
seats O
the O
evening O
before O
kept O
it O
waiting; O
some O
even O
were O
still O
in O
bed O
in O
their O
houses. O
Hivert O
called, O
shouted, O
swore; O
then O
he O
got O
down O
from O
his O
seat O
and O
went O
and O
knocked O
loudly O
at O
the O
doors. O
The O
wind O
blew O
through O
the O
cracked O
windows. O
The O
four O
seats, O
however, O
filled O
up. O
The O
carriage O
rolled O
off; O
rows O
of O
apple-trees O
followed O
one O
upon O
another, O
and O
the O
road O
between O
its O
two O
long O
ditches, O
full O
of O
yellow O
water, O
rose, O
constantly O
narrowing O
towards O
the O
horizon. O
Emma O
knew O
it O
from O
end O
to O
end; O
she O
knew O
that O
after O
a O
meadow O
there O
was O
a O
sign-post, O
next O
an O
elm, O
a O
barn, O
or O
the O
hut O
of O
a O
lime-kiln O
tender. O
Sometimes O
even, O
in O
the O
hope O
of O
getting O
some O
surprise, O
she O
shut O
her O
eyes, O
but O
she O
never O
lost O
the O
clear O
perception O
of O
the O
distance O
to O
be O
traversed. O
At O
last O
the O
brick O
houses O
began O
to O
follow O
one O
another O
more O
closely, O
the O
earth O
resounded O
beneath O
the O
wheels, O
the O
"Hirondelle" O
glided O
between O
the O
gardens, O
where O
through O
an O
opening O
one O
saw O
statues, O
a O
periwinkle O
plant, O
clipped O
yews, O
and O
a O
swing. O
Then O
on O
a O
sudden O
the O
town O
appeared. O
Sloping O
down O
like O
an O
amphitheatre, O
and O
drowned O
in O
the O
fog, O
it O
widened O
out O
beyond O
the O
bridges O
confusedly. O
Then O
the O
open O
country O
spread O
away O
with O
a O
monotonous O
movement O
till O
it O
touched O
in O
the O
distance O
the O
vague O
line O
of O
the O
pale O
sky. O
Seen O
thus O
from O
above, O
the O
whole O
landscape O
looked O
immovable O
as O
a O
picture; O
the O
anchored O
ships O
were O
massed O
in O
one O
corner, O
the O
river O
curved O
round O
the O
foot O
of O
the O
green O
hills, O
and O
the O
isles, O
oblique O
in O
shape, O
lay O
on O
the O
water, O
like O
large, O
motionless, O
black O
fishes. O
The O
factory O
chimneys O
belched O
forth O
immense O
brown O
fumes O
that O
were O
blown O
away O
at O
the O
top. O
One O
heard O
the O
rumbling O
of O
the O
foundries, O
together O
with O
the O
clear O
chimes O
of O
the O
churches O
that O
stood O
out O
in O
the O
mist. O
The O
leafless O
trees O
on O
the O
boulevards O
made O
violet O
thickets O
in O
the O
midst O
of O
the O
houses, O
and O
the O
roofs, O
all O
shining O
with O
the O
rain, O
threw O
back O
unequal O
reflections, O
according O
to O
the O
height O
of O
the O
quarters O
in O
which O
they O
were. O
Sometimes O
a O
gust O
of O
wind O
drove O
the O
clouds O
towards O
the O
Saint O
Catherine O
hills, O
like O
aerial O
waves O
that O
broke O
silently O
against O
a O
cliff. O
A O
giddiness O
seemed O
to O
her O
to O
detach O
itself O
from O
this O
mass O
of O
existence, O
and O
her O
heart O
swelled O
as O
if O
the O
hundred O
and O
twenty O
thousand O
souls O
that O
palpitated O
there O
had O
all O
at O
once O
sent O
into O
it O
the O
vapour O
of O
the O
passions O
she O
fancied O
theirs. O
Her O
love O
grew O
in O
the O
presence O
of O
this O
vastness, O
and O
expanded O
with O
tumult O
to O
the O
vague O
murmurings O
that O
rose O
towards O
her. O
She O
poured O
it O
out O
upon O
the O
square, O
on O
the O
walks, O
on O
the O
streets, O
and O
the O
old O
Norman O
city O
outspread O
before O
her O
eyes O
as O
an O
enormous O
capital, O
as O
a O
Babylon O
into O
which O
she O
was O
entering. O
She O
leant O
with O
both O
hands O
against O
the O
window, O
drinking O
in O
the O
breeze; O
the O
three O
horses O
galloped, O
the O
stones O
grated O
in O
the O
mud, O
the O
diligence O
rocked, O
and O
Hivert, O
from O
afar, O
hailed O
the O
carts O
on O
the O
road, O
while O
the O
bourgeois O
who O
had O
spent O
the O
night O
at O
the O
Guillaume O
woods O
came O
quietly O
down O
the O
hill O
in O
their O
little O
family O
carriages. O
They O
stopped O
at O
the O
barrier; O
Emma O
undid O
her O
overshoes, O
put O
on O
other O
gloves, O
rearranged O
her O
shawl, O
and O
some O
twenty O
paces O
farther O
she O
got O
down O
from O
the O
"Hirondelle." O
The O
town O
was O
then O
awakening. O
Shop-boys O
in O
caps O
were O
cleaning O
up O
the O
shop-fronts, O
and O
women O
with O
baskets O
against O
their O
hips, O
at O
intervals O
uttered O
sonorous O
cries O
at O
the O
corners O
of O
streets. O
She O
walked O
with O
downcast O
eyes, O
close O
to O
the O
walls, O
and O
smiling O
with O
pleasure O
under O
her O
lowered O
black O
veil. O
For O
fear O
of O
being O
seen, O
she O
did O
not O
usually O
take O
the O
most O
direct O
road. O
She O
plunged O
into O
dark O
alleys, O
and, O
all O
perspiring, O
reached O
the O
bottom O
of O
the O
Rue O
Nationale, O
near O
the O
fountain O
that O
stands O
there. O
It, O
is O
the O
quarter O
for O
theatres, O
public-houses, O
and O
whores. O
Often O
a O
cart O
would O
pass O
near O
her, O
bearing O
some O
shaking O
scenery. O
Waiters O
in O
aprons O
were O
sprinkling O
sand O
on O
the O
flagstones O
between O
green O
shrubs. O
It O
all O
smelt O
of O
absinthe, O
cigars, O
and O
oysters. O
She O
turned O
down O
a O
street; O
she O
recognised O
him O
by O
his O
curling O
hair O
that O
escaped O
from O
beneath O
his O
hat. O
Leon O
walked O
along O
the O
pavement. O
She O
followed O
him O
to O
the O
hotel. O
He O
went O
up, O
opened O
the O
door, O
entered-- O
What O
an O
embrace! O
Then, O
after O
the O
kisses, O
the O
words O
gushed O
forth. O
They O
told O
each O
other O
the O
sorrows O
of O
the O
week, O
the O
presentiments, O
the O
anxiety O
for O
the O
letters; O
but O
now O
everything O
was O
forgotten; O
they O
gazed O
into O
each O
other's O
faces O
with O
voluptuous O
laughs, O
and O
tender O
names. O
The O
bed O
was O
large, O
of O
mahogany, O
in O
the O
shape O
of O
a O
boat. O
The O
curtains O
were O
in O
red O
levantine, O
that O
hung O
from O
the O
ceiling O
and O
bulged O
out O
too O
much O
towards O
the O
bell-shaped O
bedside; O
and O
nothing O
in O
the O
world O
was O
so O
lovely O
as O
her O
brown O
head O
and O
white O
skin O
standing O
out O
against O
this O
purple O
colour, O
when, O
with O
a O
movement O
of O
shame, O
she O
crossed O
her O
bare O
arms, O
hiding O
her O
face O
in O
her O
hands. O
The O
warm O
room, O
with O
its O
discreet O
carpet, O
its O
gay O
ornaments, O
and O
its O
calm O
light, O
seemed O
made O
for O
the O
intimacies O
of O
passion. O
The O
curtain-rods, O
ending O
in O
arrows, O
their O
brass O
pegs, O
and O
the O
great O
balls O
of O
the O
fire-dogs O
shone O
suddenly O
when O
the O
sun O
came O
in. O
On O
the O
chimney O
between O
the O
candelabra O
there O
were O
two O
of O
those O
pink O
shells O
in O
which O
one O
hears O
the O
murmur O
of O
the O
sea O
if O
one O
holds O
them O
to O
the O
ear. O
How O
they O
loved O
that O
dear O
room, O
so O
full O
of O
gaiety, O
despite O
its O
rather O
faded O
splendour! O
They O
always O
found O
the O
furniture O
in O
the O
same O
place, O
and O
sometimes O
hairpins, O
that O
she O
had O
forgotten O
the O
Thursday O
before, O
under O
the O
pedestal O
of O
the O
clock. O
They O
lunched O
by O
the O
fireside O
on O
a O
little O
round O
table, O
inlaid O
with O
rosewood. O
Emma O
carved, O
put O
bits O
on O
his O
plate O
with O
all O
sorts O
of O
coquettish O
ways, O
and O
she O
laughed O
with O
a O
sonorous O
and O
libertine O
laugh O
when O
the O
froth O
of O
the O
champagne O
ran O
over O
from O
the O
glass O
to O
the O
rings O
on O
her O
fingers. O
They O
were O
so O
completely O
lost O
in O
the O
possession O
of O
each O
other O
that O
they O
thought O
themselves O
in O
their O
own O
house, O
and O
that O
they O
would O
live O
there O
till O
death, O
like O
two O
spouses O
eternally O
young. O
They O
said O
"our O
room," O
"our O
carpet," O
she O
even O
said O
"my O
slippers," O
a O
gift O
of O
Leon's, O
a O
whim O
she O
had O
had. O
They O
were O
pink O
satin, O
bordered O
with O
swansdown. O
When O
she O
sat O
on O
his O
knees, O
her O
leg, O
then O
too O
short, O
hung O
in O
the O
air, O
and O
the O
dainty O
shoe, O
that O
had O
no O
back O
to O
it, O
was O
held O
only O
by O
the O
toes O
to O
her O
bare O
foot. O
He O
for O
the O
first O
time O
enjoyed O
the O
inexpressible O
delicacy O
of O
feminine O
refinements. O
He O
had O
never O
met O
this O
grace O
of O
language, O
this O
reserve O
of O
clothing, O
these O
poses O
of O
the O
weary O
dove. O
He O
admired O
the O
exaltation O
of O
her O
soul O
and O
the O
lace O
on O
her O
petticoat. O
Besides, O
was O
she O
not O
"a O
lady" O
and O
a O
married O
woman O
-- O
a O
real O
mistress, O
in O
fine? O
By O
the O
diversity O
of O
her O
humour, O
in O
turn O
mystical O
or O
mirthful, O
talkative, O
taciturn, O
passionate, O
careless, O
she O
awakened O
in O
him O
a O
thousand O
desires, O
called O
up O
instincts O
or O
memories. O
She O
was O
the O
mistress O
of O
all O
the O
novels, O
the O
heroine O
of O
all O
the O
dramas, O
the O
vague O
"she" O
of O
all O
the O
volumes O
of O
verse. O
He O
found O
again O
on O
her O
shoulder O
the O
amber O
colouring O
of O
the O
"Odalisque O
Bathing"; O
she O
had O
the O
long O
waist O
of O
feudal O
chatelaines, O
and O
she O
resembled O
the O
"Pale O
Woman O
of O
Barcelona." O
But O
above O
all O
she O
was O
the O
Angel! O
Often O
looking O
at O
her, O
it O
seemed O
to O
him O
that O
his O
soul, O
escaping O
towards O
her, O
spread O
like O
a O
wave O
about O
the O
outline O
of O
her O
head, O
and O
descended O
drawn O
down O
into O
the O
whiteness O
of O
her O
breast. O
He O
knelt O
on O
the O
ground O
before O
her, O
and O
with O
both O
elbows O
on O
her O
knees O
looked O
at O
her O
with O
a O
smile, O
his O
face O
upturned. O
She O
bent O
over O
him, O
and O
murmured, O
as O
if O
choking O
with O
intoxication-- O
"Oh, O
do O
not O
move! O
do O
not O
speak! O
look O
at O
me! O
Something O
so O
sweet O
comes O
from O
your O
eyes O
that O
helps O
me O
so O
much!" O
She O
called O
him O
"child." O
"Child, O
do O
you O
love O
me?" O
And O
she O
did O
not O
listen O
for O
his O
answer O
in O
the O
haste O
of O
her O
lips O
that O
fastened O
to O
his O
mouth. O
On O
the O
clock O
there O
was O
a O
bronze O
cupid, O
who O
smirked O
as O
he O
bent O
his O
arm O
beneath O
a O
golden O
garland. O
They O
had O
laughed O
at O
it O
many O
a O
time, O
but O
when O
they O
had O
to O
part O
everything O
seemed O
serious O
to O
them. O
Motionless O
in O
front O
of O
each O
other, O
they O
kept O
repeating, O
"Till O
Thursday, O
till O
Thursday." O
Suddenly O
she O
seized O
his O
head O
between O
her O
hands, O
kissed O
him O
hurriedly O
on O
the O
forehead, O
crying, O
"Adieu!" O
and O
rushed O
down O
the O
stairs. O
She O
went O
to O
a O
hairdresser's O
in O
the O
Rue O
de O
la O
Comedie O
to O
have O
her O
hair O
arranged. O
Night O
fell; O
the O
gas O
was O
lighted O
in O
the O
shop. O
She O
heard O
the O
bell O
at O
the O
theatre O
calling O
the O
mummers O
to O
the O
performance, O
and O
she O
saw, O
passing O
opposite, O
men O
with O
white O
faces O
and O
women O
in O
faded O
gowns O
going O
in O
at O
the O
stage-door. O
It O
was O
hot O
in O
the O
room, O
small, O
and O
too O
low O
where O
the O
stove O
was O
hissing O
in O
the O
midst O
of O
wigs O
and O
pomades. O
The O
smell O
of O
the O
tongs, O
together O
with O
the O
greasy O
hands O
that O
handled O
her O
head, O
soon O
stunned O
her, O
and O
she O
dozed O
a O
little O
in O
her O
wrapper. O
Often, O
as O
he O
did O
her O
hair, O
the O
man O
offered O
her O
tickets O
for O
a O
masked O
ball. O
Then O
she O
went O
away. O
She O
went O
up O
the O
streets; O
reached O
the O
Croix-Rouge, O
put O
on O
her O
overshoes, O
that O
she O
had O
hidden O
in O
the O
morning O
under O
the O
seat, O
and O
sank O
into O
her O
place O
among O
the O
impatient O
passengers. O
Some O
got O
out O
at O
the O
foot O
of O
the O
hill. O
She O
remained O
alone O
in O
the O
carriage. O
At O
every O
turning O
all O
the O
lights O
of O
the O
town O
were O
seen O
more O
and O
more O
completely, O
making O
a O
great O
luminous O
vapour O
about O
the O
dim O
houses. O
Emma O
knelt O
on O
the O
cushions O
and O
her O
eyes O
wandered O
over O
the O
dazzling O
light. O
She O
sobbed; O
called O
on O
Leon, O
sent O
him O
tender O
words O
and O
kisses O
lost O
in O
the O
wind. O
On O
the O
hillside O
a O
poor O
devil O
wandered O
about O
with O
his O
stick O
in O
the O
midst O
of O
the O
diligences. O
A O
mass O
of O
rags O
covered O
his O
shoulders, O
and O
an O
old O
staved-in O
beaver, O
turned O
out O
like O
a O
basin, O
hid O
his O
face; O
but O
when O
he O
took O
it O
off O
he O
discovered O
in O
the O
place O
of O
eyelids O
empty O
and O
bloody O
orbits. O
The O
flesh O
hung O
in O
red O
shreds, O
and O
there O
flowed O
from O
it O
liquids O
that O
congealed O
into O
green O
scale O
down O
to O
the O
nose, O
whose O
black O
nostrils O
sniffed O
convulsively. O
To O
speak O
to O
you O
he O
threw O
back O
his O
head O
with O
an O
idiotic O
laugh; O
then O
his O
bluish O
eyeballs, O
rolling O
constantly, O
at O
the O
temples O
beat O
against O
the O
edge O
of O
the O
open O
wound. O
He O
sang O
a O
little O
song O
as O
he O
followed O
the O
carriages-- O
"Maids O
an O
the O
warmth O
of O
a O
summer O
day O
Dream O
of O
love, O
and O
of O
love O
always" O
And O
all O
the O
rest O
was O
about O
birds O
and O
sunshine O
and O
green O
leaves. O
Sometimes O
he O
appeared O
suddenly O
behind O
Emma, O
bareheaded, O
and O
she O
drew O
back O
with O
a O
cry. O
Hivert O
made O
fun O
of O
him. O
He O
would O
advise O
him O
to O
get O
a O
booth O
at O
the O
Saint O
Romain O
fair, O
or O
else O
ask O
him, O
laughing, O
how O
his O
young O
woman O
was. O
Often O
they O
had O
started O
when, O
with O
a O
sudden O
movement, O
his O
hat O
entered O
the O
diligence O
through O
the O
small O
window, O
while O
he O
clung O
with O
his O
other O
arm O
to O
the O
footboard, O
between O
the O
wheels O
splashing O
mud. O
His O
voice, O
feeble O
at O
first O
and O
quavering, O
grew O
sharp; O
it O
resounded O
in O
the O
night O
like O
the O
indistinct O
moan O
of O
a O
vague O
distress; O
and O
through O
the O
ringing O
of O
the O
bells, O
the O
murmur O
of O
the O
trees, O
and O
the O
rumbling O
of O
the O
empty O
vehicle, O
it O
had O
a O
far-off O
sound O
that O
disturbed O
Emma. O
It O
went O
to O
the O
bottom O
of O
her O
soul, O
like O
a O
whirlwind O
in O
an O
abyss, O
and O
carried O
her O
away O
into O
the O
distances O
of O
a O
boundless O
melancholy. O
But O
Hivert, O
noticing O
a O
weight O
behind, O
gave O
the O
blind O
man O
sharp O
cuts O
with O
his O
whip. O
The O
thong O
lashed O
his O
wounds, O
and O
he O
fell O
back O
into O
the O
mud O
with O
a O
yell. O
Then O
the O
passengers O
in O
the O
"Hirondelle" O
ended O
by O
falling O
asleep, O
some O
with O
open O
mouths, O
others O
with O
lowered O
chins, O
leaning O
against O
their O
neighbour's O
shoulder, O
or O
with O
their O
arm O
passed O
through O
the O
strap, O
oscillating O
regularly O
with O
the O
jolting O
of O
the O
carriage; O
and O
the O
reflection O
of O
the O
lantern O
swinging O
without, O
on O
the O
crupper O
of O
the O
wheeler; O
penetrating O
into O
the O
interior O
through O
the O
chocolate O
calico O
curtains, O
threw O
sanguineous O
shadows O
over O
all O
these O
motionless O
people. O
Emma, O
drunk O
with O
grief, O
shivered O
in O
her O
clothes, O
feeling O
her O
feet O
grow O
colder O
and O
colder, O
and O
death O
in O
her O
soul. O
Charles O
at O
home O
was O
waiting O
for O
her; O
the O
"Hirondelle" O
was O
always O
late O
on O
Thursdays. O
Madame O
arrived O
at O
last, O
and O
scarcely O
kissed O
the O
child. O
The O
dinner O
was O
not O
ready. O
No O
matter! O
She O
excused O
the O
servant. O
This O
girl O
now O
seemed O
allowed O
to O
do O
just O
as O
she O
liked. O
Often O
her O
husband, O
noting O
her O
pallor, O
asked O
if O
she O
were O
unwell. O
"No," O
said O
Emma. O
"But," O
he O
replied, O
"you O
seem O
so O
strange O
this O
evening." O
"Oh, O
it's O
nothing! O
nothing!" O
There O
were O
even O
days O
when O
she O
had O
no O
sooner O
come O
in O
than O
she O
went O
up O
to O
her O
room; O
and O
Justin, O
happening O
to O
be O
there, O
moved O
about O
noiselessly, O
quicker O
at O
helping O
her O
than O
the O
best O
of O
maids. O
He O
put O
the O
matches O
ready, O
the O
candlestick, O
a O
book, O
arranged O
her O
nightgown, O
turned O
back O
the O
bedclothes. O
"Come!" O
said O
she, O
"that O
will O
do. O
Now O
you O
can O
go." O
For O
he O
stood O
there, O
his O
hands O
hanging O
down O
and O
his O
eyes O
wide O
open, O
as O
if O
enmeshed O
in O
the O
innumerable O
threads O
of O
a O
sudden O
reverie. O
The O
following O
day O
was O
frightful, O
and O
those O
that O
came O
after O
still O
more O
unbearable, O
because O
of O
her O
impatience O
to O
once O
again O
seize O
her O
happiness; O
an O
ardent O
lust, O
inflamed O
by O
the O
images O
of O
past O
experience, O
and O
that O
burst O
forth O
freely O
on O
the O
seventh O
day O
beneath O
Leon's O
caresses. O
His O
ardours O
were O
hidden O
beneath O
outbursts O
of O
wonder O
and O
gratitude. O
Emma O
tasted O
this O
love O
in O
a O
discreet, O
absorbed O
fashion, O
maintained O
it O
by O
all O
the O
artifices O
of O
her O
tenderness, O
and O
trembled O
a O
little O
lest O
it O
should O
be O
lost O
later O
on. O
She O
often O
said O
to O
him, O
with O
her O
sweet, O
melancholy O
voice-- O
"Ah! O
you O
too, O
you O
will O
leave O
me! O
You O
will O
marry! O
You O
will O
be O
like O
all O
the O
others." O
He O
asked, O
"What O
others?" O
"Why, O
like O
all O
men," O
she O
replied. O
Then O
added, O
repulsing O
him O
with O
a O
languid O
movement-- O
"You O
are O
all O
evil!" O
One O
day, O
as O
they O
were O
talking O
philosophically O
of O
earthly O
disillusions, O
to O
experiment O
on O
his O
jealousy, O
or O
yielding, O
perhaps, O
to O
an O
over-strong O
need O
to O
pour O
out O
her O
heart, O
she O
told O
him O
that O
formerly, O
before O
him, O
she O
had O
loved O
someone. O
"Not O
like O
you," O
she O
went O
on O
quickly, O
protesting O
by O
the O
head O
of O
her O
child O
that O
"nothing O
had O
passed O
between O
them." O
The O
young O
man O
believed O
her, O
but O
none O
the O
less O
questioned O
her O
to O
find O
out O
what O
he O
was. O
"He O
was O
a O
ship's O
captain, O
my O
dear." O
Was O
this O
not O
preventing O
any O
inquiry, O
and, O
at O
the O
same O
time, O
assuming O
a O
higher O
ground O
through O
this O
pretended O
fascination O
exercised O
over O
a O
man O
who O
must O
have O
been O
of O
warlike O
nature O
and O
accustomed O
to O
receive O
homage? O
The O
clerk O
then O
felt O
the O
lowliness O
of O
his O
position; O
he O
longed O
for O
epaulettes, O
crosses, O
titles. O
All O
that O
would O
please O
her-- O
he O
gathered O
that O
from O
her O
spendthrift O
habits. O
Emma O
nevertheless O
concealed O
many O
of O
these O
extravagant O
fancies, O
such O
as O
her O
wish O
to O
have O
a O
blue O
tilbury O
to O
drive O
into O
Rouen, O
drawn O
by O
an O
English O
horse O
and O
driven O
by O
a O
groom O
in O
top-boots. O
It O
was O
Justin O
who O
had O
inspired O
her O
with O
this O
whim, O
by O
begging O
her O
to O
take O
him O
into O
her O
service O
as O
valet-de-chambre, O
and O
if O
the O
privation O
of O
it O
did O
not O
lessen O
the O
pleasure O
of O
her O
arrival O
at O
each O
rendezvous, O
it O
certainly O
augmented O
the O
bitterness O
of O
the O
return. O
MANSERVANT. O
Often, O
when O
they O
talked O
together O
of O
Paris, O
she O
ended O
by O
murmuring, O
"Ah! O
how O
happy O
we O
should O
be O
there!" O
"Are O
we O
not O
happy?" O
gently O
answered O
the O
young O
man O
passing O
his O
hands O
over O
her O
hair. O
"Yes, O
that O
is O
true," O
she O
said. O
"I O
am O
mad. O
Kiss O
me!" O
To O
her O
husband O
she O
was O
more O
charming O
than O
ever. O
She O
made O
him O
pistachio-creams, O
and O
played O
him O
waltzes O
after O
dinner. O
So O
he O
thought O
himself O
the O
most O
fortunate O
of O
men O
and O
Emma O
was O
without O
uneasiness, O
when, O
one O
evening O
suddenly O
he O
said-- O
"It O
is O
Mademoiselle O
Lempereur, O
isn't O
it, O
who O
gives O
you O
lessons?" O
"Yes." O
"Well, O
I O
saw O
her O
just O
now," O
Charles O
went O
on, O
"at O
Madame O
Liegeard's. O
I O
spoke O
to O
her O
about O
you, O
and O
she O
doesn't O
know O
you." O
This O
was O
like O
a O
thunderclap. O
However, O
she O
replied O
quite O
naturally-- O
"Ah! O
no O
doubt O
she O
forgot O
my O
name." O
"But O
perhaps," O
said O
the O
doctor, O
"there O
are O
several O
Demoiselles O
Lempereur O
at O
Rouen O
who O
are O
music-mistresses." O
"Possibly!" O
Then O
quickly-- O
"But O
I O
have O
my O
receipts O
here. O
See!" O
And O
she O
went O
to O
the O
writing-table, O
ransacked O
all O
the O
drawers, O
rummaged O
the O
papers, O
and O
at O
last O
lost O
her O
head O
so O
completely O
that O
Charles O
earnestly O
begged O
her O
not O
to O
take O
so O
much O
trouble O
about O
those O
wretched O
receipts. O
"Oh, O
I O
will O
find O
them," O
she O
said. O
And, O
in O
fact, O
on O
the O
following O
Friday, O
as O
Charles O
was O
putting O
on O
one O
of O
his O
boots O
in O
the O
dark O
cabinet O
where O
his O
clothes O
were O
kept, O
he O
felt O
a O
piece O
of O
paper O
between O
the O
leather O
and O
his O
sock. O
He O
took O
it O
out O
and O
read-- O
"Received, O
for O
three O
months' O
lessons O
and O
several O
pieces O
of O
music, O
the O
sum O
of O
sixty-three O
francs.-- O
Felicie O
Lempereur, O
professor O
of O
music." O
"How O
the O
devil O
did O
it O
get O
into O
my O
boots?" O
"It O
must," O
she O
replied, O
"have O
fallen O
from O
the O
old O
box O
of O
bills O
that O
is O
on O
the O
edge O
of O
the O
shelf." O
From O
that O
moment O
her O
existence O
was O
but O
one O
long O
tissue O
of O
lies, O
in O
which O
she O
enveloped O
her O
love O
as O
in O
veils O
to O
hide O
it. O
It O
was O
a O
want, O
a O
mania, O
a O
pleasure O
carried O
to O
such O
an O
extent O
that O
if O
she O
said O
she O
had O
the O
day O
before O
walked O
on O
the O
right O
side O
of O
a O
road, O
one O
might O
know O
she O
had O
taken O
the O
left. O
One O
morning, O
when O
she O
had O
gone, O
as O
usual, O
rather O
lightly O
clothed, O
it O
suddenly O
began O
to O
snow, O
and O
as O
Charles O
was O
watching O
the O
weather O
from O
the O
window, O
he O
caught O
sight O
of O
Monsieur O
Bournisien O
in O
the O
chaise O
of O
Monsieur O
Tuvache, O
who O
was O
driving O
him O
to O
Rouen. O
Then O
he O
went O
down O
to O
give O
the O
priest O
a O
thick O
shawl O
that O
he O
was O
to O
hand O
over O
to O
Emma O
as O
soon O
as O
he O
reached O
the O
"Croix-Rouge." O
When O
he O
got O
to O
the O
inn, O
Monsieur O
Bournisien O
asked O
for O
the O
wife O
of O
the O
Yonville O
doctor. O
The O
landlady O
replied O
that O
she O
very O
rarely O
came O
to O
her O
establishment. O
So O
that O
evening, O
when O
he O
recognised O
Madame O
Bovary O
in O
the O
"Hirondelle," O
the O
cure O
told O
her O
his O
dilemma, O
without, O
however, O
appearing O
to O
attach O
much O
importance O
to O
it, O
for O
he O
began O
praising O
a O
preacher O
who O
was O
doing O
wonders O
at O
the O
Cathedral, O
and O
whom O
all O
the O
ladies O
were O
rushing O
to O
hear. O
Still, O
if O
he O
did O
not O
ask O
for O
any O
explanation, O
others, O
later O
on, O
might O
prove O
less O
discreet. O
So O
she O
thought O
well O
to O
get O
down O
each O
time O
at O
the O
"Croix-Rouge," O
so O
that O
the O
good O
folk O
of O
her O
village O
who O
saw O
her O
on O
the O
stairs O
should O
suspect O
nothing. O
One O
day, O
however, O
Monsieur O
Lheureux O
met O
her O
coming O
out O
of O
the O
Hotel O
de O
Boulogne O
on O
Leon's O
arm; O
and O
she O
was O
frightened, O
thinking O
he O
would O
gossip. O
He O
was O
not O
such O
a O
fool. O
But O
three O
days O
after O
he O
came O
to O
her O
room, O
shut O
the O
door, O
and O
said, O
"I O
must O
have O
some O
money." O
She O
declared O
she O
could O
not O
give O
him O
any. O
Lheureux O
burst O
into O
lamentations O
and O
reminded O
her O
of O
all O
the O
kindnesses O
he O
had O
shown O
her. O
In O
fact, O
of O
the O
two O
bills O
signed O
by O
Charles, O
Emma O
up O
to O
the O
present O
had O
paid O
only O
one. O
As O
to O
the O
second, O
the O
shopkeeper, O
at O
her O
request, O
had O
consented O
to O
replace O
it O
by O
another, O
which O
again O
had O
been O
renewed O
for O
a O
long O
date. O
Then O
he O
drew O
from O
his O
pocket O
a O
list O
of O
goods O
not O
paid O
for; O
to O
wit, O
the O
curtains, O
the O
carpet, O
the O
material O
for O
the O
armchairs, O
several O
dresses, O
and O
divers O
articles O
of O
dress, O
the O
bills O
for O
which O
amounted O
to O
about O
two O
thousand O
francs. O
She O
bowed O
her O
head. O
He O
went O
on-- O
"But O
if O
you O
haven't O
any O
ready O
money, O
you O
have O
an O
estate." O
And O
he O
reminded O
her O
of O
a O
miserable O
little O
hovel O
situated O
at O
Barneville, O
near O
Aumale, O
that O
brought O
in O
almost O
nothing. O
It O
had O
formerly O
been O
part O
of O
a O
small O
farm O
sold O
by O
Monsieur O
Bovary O
senior; O
for O
Lheureux O
knew O
everything, O
even O
to O
the O
number O
of O
acres O
and O
the O
names O
of O
the O
neighbours. O
"If O
I O
were O
in O
your O
place," O
he O
said, O
"I O
should O
clear O
myself O
of O
my O
debts, O
and O
have O
money O
left O
over." O
She O
pointed O
out O
the O
difficulty O
of O
getting O
a O
purchaser. O
He O
held O
out O
the O
hope O
of O
finding O
one; O
but O
she O
asked O
him O
how O
she O
should O
manage O
to O
sell O
it. O
"Haven't O
you O
your O
power O
of O
attorney?" O
he O
replied. O
The O
phrase O
came O
to O
her O
like O
a O
breath O
of O
fresh O
air. O
"Leave O
me O
the O
bill," O
said O
Emma. O
"Oh, O
it O
isn't O
worth O
while," O
answered O
Lheureux. O
He O
came O
back O
the O
following O
week O
and O
boasted O
of O
having, O
after O
much O
trouble, O
at O
last O
discovered O
a O
certain O
Langlois, O
who, O
for O
a O
long O
time, O
had O
had O
an O
eye O
on O
the O
property, O
but O
without O
mentioning O
his O
price. O
"Never O
mind O
the O
price!" O
she O
cried. O
But O
they O
would, O
on O
the O
contrary, O
have O
to O
wait, O
to O
sound O
the O
fellow. O
The O
thing O
was O
worth O
a O
journey, O
and, O
as O
she O
could O
not O
undertake O
it, O
he O
offered O
to O
go O
to O
the O
place O
to O
have O
an O
interview O
with O
Langlois. O
On O
his O
return O
he O
announced O
that O
the O
purchaser O
proposed O
four O
thousand O
francs. O
Emma O
was O
radiant O
at O
this O
news. O
"Frankly," O
he O
added, O
"that's O
a O
good O
price." O
She O
drew O
half O
the O
sum O
at O
once, O
and O
when O
she O
was O
about O
to O
pay O
her O
account O
the O
shopkeeper O
said-- O
"It O
really O
grieves O
me, O
on O
my O
word! O
to O
see O
you O
depriving O
yourself O
all O
at O
once O
of O
such O
a O
big O
sum O
as O
that." O
Then O
she O
looked O
at O
the O
bank-notes, O
and O
dreaming O
of O
the O
unlimited O
number O
of O
rendezvous O
represented O
by O
those O
two O
thousand O
francs, O
she O
stammered-- O
"What! O
what!" O
"Oh!" O
he O
went O
on, O
laughing O
good-naturedly, O
"one O
puts O
anything O
one O
likes O
on O
receipts. O
Don't O
you O
think O
I O
know O
what O
household O
affairs O
are?" O
And O
he O
looked O
at O
her O
fixedly, O
while O
in O
his O
hand O
he O
held O
two O
long O
papers O
that O
he O
slid O
between O
his O
nails. O
At O
last, O
opening O
his O
pocket-book, O
he O
spread O
out O
on O
the O
table O
four O
bills O
to O
order, O
each O
for O
a O
thousand O
francs. O
"Sign O
these," O
he O
said, O
"and O
keep O
it O
all!" O
She O
cried O
out, O
scandalised. O
"But O
if O
I O
give O
you O
the O
surplus," O
replied O
Monsieur O
Lheureux O
impudently, O
"is O
that O
not O
helping O
you?" O
And O
taking O
a O
pen O
he O
wrote O
at O
the O
bottom O
of O
the O
account, O
"Received O
of O
Madame O
Bovary O
four O
thousand O
francs." O
"Now O
who O
can O
trouble O
you, O
since O
in O
six O
months O
you'll O
draw O
the O
arrears O
for O
your O
cottage, O
and O
I O
don't O
make O
the O
last O
bill O
due O
till O
after O
you've O
been O
paid?" O
Emma O
grew O
rather O
confused O
in O
her O
calculations, O
and O
her O
ears O
tingled O
as O
if O
gold O
pieces, O
bursting O
from O
their O
bags, O
rang O
all O
round O
her O
on O
the O
floor. O
At O
last O
Lheureux O
explained O
that O
he O
had O
a O
very O
good O
friend, O
Vincart, O
a O
broker O
at O
Rouen, O
who O
would O
discount O
these O
four O
bills. O
Then O
he O
himself O
would O
hand O
over O
to O
madame O
the O
remainder O
after O
the O
actual O
debt O
was O
paid. O
But O
instead O
of O
two O
thousand O
francs O
he O
brought O
only O
eighteen O
hundred, O
for O
the O
friend O
Vincart O
(which O
was O
only O
fair) O
had O
deducted O
two O
hundred O
francs O
for O
commission O
and O
discount. O
Then O
he O
carelessly O
asked O
for O
a O
receipt. O
"You O
understand-- O
in O
business-- O
sometimes. O
And O
with O
the O
date, O
if O
you O
please, O
with O
the O
date." O
A O
horizon O
of O
realisable O
whims O
opened O
out O
before O
Emma. O
She O
was O
prudent O
enough O
to O
lay O
by O
a O
thousand O
crowns, O
with O
which O
the O
first O
three O
bills O
were O
paid O
when O
they O
fell O
due; O
but O
the O
fourth, O
by O
chance, O
came O
to O
the O
house O
on O
a O
Thursday, O
and O
Charles, O
quite O
upset, O
patiently O
awaited O
his O
wife's O
return O
for O
an O
explanation. O
If O
she O
had O
not O
told O
him O
about O
this O
bill, O
it O
was O
only O
to O
spare O
him O
such O
domestic O
worries; O
she O
sat O
on O
his O
knees, O
caressed O
him, O
cooed O
to O
him, O
gave O
him O
a O
long O
enumeration O
of O
all O
the O
indispensable O
things O
that O
had O
been O
got O
on O
credit. O
"Really, O
you O
must O
confess, O
considering O
the O
quantity, O
it O
isn't O
too O
dear." O
Charles, O
at O
his O
wit's O
end, O
soon O
had O
recourse O
to O
the O
eternal O
Lheureux, O
who O
swore O
he O
would O
arrange O
matters O
if O
the O
doctor O
would O
sign O
him O
two O
bills, O
one O
of O
which O
was O
for O
seven O
hundred O
francs, O
payable O
in O
three O
months. O
In O
order O
to O
arrange O
for O
this O
he O
wrote O
his O
mother O
a O
pathetic O
letter. O
Instead O
of O
sending O
a O
reply O
she O
came O
herself; O
and O
when O
Emma O
wanted O
to O
know O
whether O
he O
had O
got O
anything O
out O
of O
her, O
"Yes," O
he O
replied; O
"but O
she O
wants O
to O
see O
the O
account." O
The O
next O
morning O
at O
daybreak O
Emma O
ran O
to O
Lheureux O
to O
beg O
him O
to O
make O
out O
another O
account O
for O
not O
more O
than O
a O
thousand O
francs, O
for O
to O
show O
the O
one O
for O
four O
thousand O
it O
would O
be O
necessary O
to O
say O
that O
she O
had O
paid O
two-thirds, O
and O
confess, O
consequently, O
the O
sale O
of O
the O
estate O
-- O
a O
negotiation O
admirably O
carried O
out O
by O
the O
shopkeeper, O
and O
which, O
in O
fact, O
was O
only O
actually O
known O
later O
on. O
Despite O
the O
low O
price O
of O
each O
article, O
Madame O
Bovary O
senior, O
of O
course, O
thought O
the O
expenditure O
extravagant. O
"Couldn't O
you O
do O
without O
a O
carpet? O
Why O
have O
recovered O
the O
arm-chairs? O
In O
my O
time O
there O
was O
a O
single O
arm-chair O
in O
a O
house, O
for O
elderly O
persons-- O
at O
any O
rate O
it O
was O
so O
at O
my O
mother's, O
who O
was O
a O
good O
woman, O
I O
can O
tell O
you. O
Everybody O
can't O
be O
rich! O
No O
fortune O
can O
hold O
out O
against O
waste! O
I O
should O
be O
ashamed O
to O
coddle O
myself O
as O
you O
do! O
And O
yet O
I O
am O
old. O
I O
need O
looking O
after. O
And O
there! O
there! O
fitting O
up O
gowns! O
fallals! O
What! O
silk O
for O
lining O
at O
two O
francs, O
when O
you O
can O
get O
jaconet O
for O
ten O
sous, O
or O
even O
for O
eight, O
that O
would O
do O
well O
enough!" O
Emma, O
lying O
on O
a O
lounge, O
replied O
as O
quietly O
as O
possible-- O
"Ah! O
Madame, O
enough! O
enough!" O
The O
other O
went O
on O
lecturing O
her, O
predicting O
they O
would O
end O
in O
the O
workhouse. O
But O
it O
was O
Bovary's O
fault. O
Luckily O
he O
had O
promised O
to O
destroy O
that O
power O
of O
attorney. O
"What?" O
"Ah! O
he O
swore O
he O
would," O
went O
on O
the O
good O
woman. O
Emma O
opened O
the O
window, O
called O
Charles, O
and O
the O
poor O
fellow O
was O
obliged O
to O
confess O
the O
promise O
torn O
from O
him O
by O
his O
mother. O
Emma O
disappeared, O
then O
came O
back O
quickly, O
and O
majestically O
handed O
her O
a O
thick O
piece O
of O
paper. O
"Thank O
you," O
said O
the O
old O
woman. O
And O
she O
threw O
the O
power O
of O
attorney O
into O
the O
fire. O
Emma O
began O
to O
laugh, O
a O
strident, O
piercing, O
continuous O
laugh; O
she O
had O
an O
attack O
of O
hysterics. O
"Oh, O
my O
God!" O
cried O
Charles. O
"Ah! O
you O
really O
are O
wrong! O
You O
come O
here O
and O
make O
scenes O
with O
her!" O
His O
mother, O
shrugging O
her O
shoulders, O
declared O
it O
was O
"all O
put O
on." O
But O
Charles, O
rebelling O
for O
the O
first O
time, O
took O
his O
wife's O
part, O
so O
that O
Madame O
Bovary, O
senior, O
said O
she O
would O
leave. O
She O
went O
the O
very O
next O
day, O
and O
on O
the O
threshold, O
as O
he O
was O
trying O
to O
detain O
her, O
she O
replied-- O
"No, O
no! O
You O
love O
her O
better O
than O
me, O
and O
you O
are O
right. O
It O
is O
natural. O
For O
the O
rest, O
so O
much O
the O
worse! O
You O
will O
see. O
Good O
day-- O
for O
I O
am O
not O
likely O
to O
come O
soon O
again, O
as O
you O
say, O
to O
make O
scenes." O
Charles O
nevertheless O
was O
very O
crestfallen O
before O
Emma, O
who O
did O
not O
hide O
the O
resentment O
she O
still O
felt O
at O
his O
want O
of O
confidence, O
and O
it O
needed O
many O
prayers O
before O
she O
would O
consent O
to O
have O
another O
power O
of O
attorney. O
He O
even O
accompanied O
her O
to O
Monsieur O
Guillaumin O
to O
have O
a O
second O
one, O
just O
like O
the O
other, O
drawn O
up. O
"I O
understand," O
said O
the O
notary; O
"a O
man O
of O
science O
can't O
be O
worried O
with O
the O
practical O
details O
of O
life." O
And O
Charles O
felt O
relieved O
by O
this O
comfortable O
reflection, O
which O
gave O
his O
weakness O
the O
flattering O
appearance O
of O
higher O
pre-occupation. O
And O
what O
an O
outburst O
the O
next O
Thursday O
at O
the O
hotel O
in O
their O
room O
with O
Leon! O
She O
laughed, O
cried, O
sang, O
sent O
for O
sherbets, O
wanted O
to O
smoke O
cigarettes, O
seemed O
to O
him O
wild O
and O
extravagant, O
but O
adorable, O
superb. O
He O
did O
not O
know O
what O
recreation O
of O
her O
whole O
being O
drove O
her O
more O
and O
more O
to O
plunge O
into O
the O
pleasures O
of O
life. O
She O
was O
becoming O
irritable, O
greedy, O
voluptuous; O
and O
she O
walked O
about O
the O
streets O
with O
him O
carrying O
her O
head O
high, O
without O
fear, O
so O
she O
said, O
of O
compromising O
herself. O
At O
times, O
however, O
Emma O
shuddered O
at O
the O
sudden O
thought O
of O
meeting O
Rodolphe, O
for O
it O
seemed O
to O
her O
that, O
although O
they O
were O
separated O
forever, O
she O
was O
not O
completely O
free O
from O
her O
subjugation O
to O
him. O
One O
night O
she O
did O
not O
return O
to O
Yonville O
at O
all. O
Charles O
lost O
his O
head O
with O
anxiety, O
and O
little O
Berthe O
would O
not O
go O
to O
bed O
without O
her O
mamma, O
and O
sobbed O
enough O
to O
break O
her O
heart. O
Justin O
had O
gone O
out O
searching O
the O
road O
at O
random. O
Monsieur O
Homais O
even O
had O
left O
his O
pharmacy. O
At O
last, O
at O
eleven O
o'clock, O
able O
to O
bear O
it O
no O
longer, O
Charles O
harnessed O
his O
chaise, O
jumped O
in, O
whipped O
up O
his O
horse, O
and O
reached O
the O
"Croix-Rouge" O
about O
two O
o'clock O
in O
the O
morning. O
No O
one O
there! O
He O
thought O
that O
the O
clerk O
had O
perhaps O
seen O
her; O
but O
where O
did O
he O
live? O
Happily, O
Charles O
remembered O
his O
employer's O
address, O
and O
rushed O
off O
there. O
Day O
was O
breaking, O
and O
he O
could O
distinguish O
the O
escutcheons O
over O
the O
door, O
and O
knocked. O
Someone, O
without O
opening O
the O
door, O
shouted O
out O
the O
required O
information, O
adding O
a O
few O
insults O
to O
those O
who O
disturb O
people O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
night. O
The O
house O
inhabited O
by O
the O
clerk O
had O
neither O
bell, O
knocker, O
nor O
porter. O
Charles O
knocked O
loudly O
at O
the O
shutters O
with O
his O
hands. O
A O
policeman O
happened O
to O
pass O
by. O
Then O
he O
was O
frightened, O
and O
went O
away. O
"I O
am O
mad," O
he O
said; O
"no O
doubt O
they O
kept O
her O
to O
dinner O
at O
Monsieur O
Lormeaux'." O
But O
the O
Lormeaux O
no O
longer O
lived O
at O
Rouen. O
"She O
probably O
stayed O
to O
look O
after O
Madame O
Dubreuil. O
Why, O
Madame O
Dubreuil O
has O
been O
dead O
these O
ten O
months! O
Where O
can O
she O
be?" O
An O
idea O
occurred O
to O
him. O
At O
a O
cafe O
he O
asked O
for O
a O
Directory, O
and O
hurriedly O
looked O
for O
the O
name O
of O
Mademoiselle O
Lempereur, O
who O
lived O
at O
No. O
74 O
Rue O
de O
la O
Renelle-des-Maroquiniers. O
As O
he O
was O
turning O
into O
the O
street, O
Emma O
herself O
appeared O
at O
the O
other O
end O
of O
it. O
He O
threw O
himself O
upon O
her O
rather O
than O
embraced O
her, O
crying-- O
"What O
kept O
you O
yesterday?" O
"I O
was O
not O
well." O
"What O
was O
it? O
Where? O
How?" O
She O
passed O
her O
hand O
over O
her O
forehead O
and O
answered, O
"At O
Mademoiselle O
Lempereur's." O
"I O
was O
sure O
of O
it! O
I O
was O
going O
there." O
"Oh, O
it O
isn't O
worth O
while," O
said O
Emma. O
"She O
went O
out O
just O
now; O
but O
for O
the O
future O
don't O
worry. O
I O
do O
not O
feel O
free, O
you O
see, O
if O
I O
know O
that O
the O
least O
delay O
upsets O
you O
like O
this." O
This O
was O
a O
sort O
of O
permission O
that O
she O
gave O
herself, O
so O
as O
to O
get O
perfect O
freedom O
in O
her O
escapades. O
And O
she O
profited O
by O
it O
freely, O
fully. O
When O
she O
was O
seized O
with O
the O
desire O
to O
see O
Leon, O
she O
set O
out O
upon O
any O
pretext; O
and O
as O
he O
was O
not O
expecting O
her O
on O
that O
day, O
she O
went O
to O
fetch O
him O
at O
his O
office. O
It O
was O
a O
great O
delight O
at O
first, O
but O
soon O
he O
no O
longer O
concealed O
the O
truth, O
which O
was, O
that O
his O
master O
complained O
very O
much O
about O
these O
interruptions. O
"Pshaw! O
come O
along," O
she O
said. O
And O
he O
slipped O
out. O
She O
wanted O
him O
to O
dress O
all O
in O
black, O
and O
grow O
a O
pointed O
beard, O
to O
look O
like O
the O
portraits O
of O
Louis O
XIII. O
She O
wanted O
to O
see O
his O
lodgings; O
thought O
them O
poor. O
He O
blushed O
at O
them, O
but O
she O
did O
not O
notice O
this, O
then O
advised O
him O
to O
buy O
some O
curtains O
like O
hers, O
and O
as O
he O
objected O
to O
the O
expense-- O
"Ah! O
ah! O
you O
care O
for O
your O
money," O
she O
said O
laughing. O
Each O
time O
Leon O
had O
to O
tell O
her O
everything O
that O
he O
had O
done O
since O
their O
last O
meeting. O
She O
asked O
him O
for O
some O
verses-- O
some O
verses O
"for O
herself," O
a O
"love O
poem" O
in O
honour O
of O
her. O
But O
he O
never O
succeeded O
in O
getting O
a O
rhyme O
for O
the O
second O
verse; O
and O
at O
last O
ended O
by O
copying O
a O
sonnet O
in O
a O
"Keepsake." O
This O
was O
less O
from O
vanity O
than O
from O
the O
one O
desire O
of O
pleasing O
her. O
He O
did O
not O
question O
her O
ideas; O
he O
accepted O
all O
her O
tastes; O
he O
was O
rather O
becoming O
her O
mistress O
than O
she O
his. O
She O
had O
tender O
words O
and O
kisses O
that O
thrilled O
his O
soul. O
Where O
could O
she O
have O
learnt O
this O
corruption O
almost O
incorporeal O
in O
the O
strength O
of O
its O
profanity O
and O
dissimulation? O
CHAPTER O
SIX O
During O
the O
journeys O
he O
made O
to O
see O
her, O
Leon O
had O
often O
dined O
at O
the O
chemist's, O
and O
he O
felt O
obliged O
from O
politeness O
to O
invite O
him O
in O
turn. O
"With O
pleasure!" O
Monsieur O
Homais O
replied; O
"besides, O
I O
must O
invigorate O
my O
mind, O
for O
I O
am O
getting O
rusty O
here. O
We'll O
go O
to O
the O
theatre, O
to O
the O
restaurant; O
we'll O
make O
a O
night O
of O
it." O
"Oh, O
my O
dear!" O
tenderly O
murmured O
Madame O
Homais, O
alarmed O
at O
the O
vague O
perils O
he O
was O
preparing O
to O
brave. O
"Well, O
what? O
Do O
you O
think O
I'm O
not O
sufficiently O
ruining O
my O
health O
living O
here O
amid O
the O
continual O
emanations O
of O
the O
pharmacy? O
But O
there! O
that O
is O
the O
way O
with O
women! O
They O
are O
jealous O
of O
science, O
and O
then O
are O
opposed O
to O
our O
taking O
the O
most O
legitimate O
distractions. O
No O
matter! O
Count O
upon O
me. O
One O
of O
these O
days O
I O
shall O
turn O
up O
at O
Rouen, O
and O
we'll O
go O
the O
pace O
together." O
The O
druggist O
would O
formerly O
have O
taken O
good O
care O
not O
to O
use O
such O
an O
expression, O
but O
he O
was O
cultivating O
a O
gay O
Parisian O
style, O
which O
he O
thought O
in O
the O
best O
taste; O
and, O
like O
his O
neighbour, O
Madame O
Bovary, O
he O
questioned O
the O
clerk O
curiously O
about O
the O
customs O
of O
the O
capital; O
he O
even O
talked O
slang O
to O
dazzle O
the O
bourgeois, O
saying O
bender, O
crummy, O
dandy, O
macaroni, O
the O
cheese, O
cut O
my O
stick O
and O
"I'll O
hook O
it," O
for O
"I O
am O
going." O
So O
one O
Thursday O
Emma O
was O
surprised O
to O
meet O
Monsieur O
Homais O
in O
the O
kitchen O
of O
the O
"Lion O
d'Or," O
wearing O
a O
traveller's O
costume, O
that O
is O
to O
say, O
wrapped O
in O
an O
old O
cloak O
which O
no O
one O
knew O
he O
had, O
while O
he O
carried O
a O
valise O
in O
one O
hand O
and O
the O
foot-warmer O
of O
his O
establishment O
in O
the O
other. O
He O
had O
confided O
his O
intentions O
to O
no O
one, O
for O
fear O
of O
causing O
the O
public O
anxiety O
by O
his O
absence. O
The O
idea O
of O
seeing O
again O
the O
place O
where O
his O
youth O
had O
been O
spent O
no O
doubt O
excited O
him, O
for O
during O
the O
whole O
journey O
he O
never O
ceased O
talking, O
and O
as O
soon O
as O
he O
had O
arrived, O
he O
jumped O
quickly O
out O
of O
the O
diligence O
to O
go O
in O
search O
of O
Leon. O
In O
vain O
the O
clerk O
tried O
to O
get O
rid O
of O
him. O
Monsieur O
Homais O
dragged O
him O
off O
to O
the O
large O
Cafe O
de O
la O
Normandie, O
which O
he O
entered O
majestically, O
not O
raising O
his O
hat, O
thinking O
it O
very O
provincial O
to O
uncover O
in O
any O
public O
place. O
Emma O
waited O
for O
Leon O
three O
quarters O
of O
an O
hour. O
At O
last O
she O
ran O
to O
his O
office; O
and, O
lost O
in O
all O
sorts O
of O
conjectures, O
accusing O
him O
of O
indifference, O
and O
reproaching O
herself O
for O
her O
weakness, O
she O
spent O
the O
afternoon, O
her O
face O
pressed O
against O
the O
window-panes. O
At O
two O
o'clock O
they O
were O
still O
at O
a O
table O
opposite O
each O
other. O
The O
large O
room O
was O
emptying; O
the O
stove-pipe, O
in O
the O
shape O
of O
a O
palm-tree, O
spread O
its O
gilt O
leaves O
over O
the O
white O
ceiling, O
and O
near O
them, O
outside O
the O
window, O
in O
the O
bright O
sunshine, O
a O
little O
fountain O
gurgled O
in O
a O
white O
basin, O
where; O
in O
the O
midst O
of O
watercress O
and O
asparagus, O
three O
torpid O
lobsters O
stretched O
across O
to O
some O
quails O
that O
lay O
heaped O
up O
in O
a O
pile O
on O
their O
sides. O
Homais O
was O
enjoying O
himself. O
Although O
he O
was O
even O
more O
intoxicated O
with O
the O
luxury O
than O
the O
rich O
fare, O
the O
Pommard O
wine O
all O
the O
same O
rather O
excited O
his O
faculties; O
and O
when O
the O
omelette O
au O
rhum O
appeared, O
he O
began O
propounding O
immoral O
theories O
about O
women. O
What O
seduced O
him O
above O
all O
else O
was O
chic. O
He O
admired O
an O
elegant O
toilette O
in O
a O
well-furnished O
apartment, O
and O
as O
to O
bodily O
qualities, O
he O
didn't O
dislike O
a O
young O
girl. O
IN O
RUM. O
Leon O
watched O
the O
clock O
in O
despair. O
The O
druggist O
went O
on O
drinking, O
eating, O
and O
talking. O
"You O
must O
be O
very O
lonely," O
he O
said O
suddenly, O
"here O
at O
Rouen. O
To O
be O
sure O
your O
lady-love O
doesn't O
live O
far O
away." O
AND O
THE O
OTHER O
BLUSHED-- O
"Come O
now, O
be O
frank. O
Can O
you O
deny O
that O
at O
Yonville O
-- O
" O
The O
young O
man O
stammered O
something. O
"At O
Madame O
Bovary's, O
you're O
not O
making O
love O
to O
-- O
" O
"To O
whom?" O
"The O
servant!" O
He O
was O
not O
joking; O
but O
vanity O
getting O
the O
better O
of O
all O
prudence, O
Leon, O
in O
spite O
of O
himself O
protested. O
Besides, O
he O
only O
liked O
dark O
women. O
"I O
approve O
of O
that," O
said O
the O
chemist; O
"they O
have O
more O
passion." O
And O
whispering O
into O
his O
friend's O
ear, O
he O
pointed O
out O
the O
symptoms O
by O
which O
one O
could O
find O
out O
if O
a O
woman O
had O
passion. O
He O
even O
launched O
into O
an O
ethnographic O
digression: O
the O
German O
was O
vapourish, O
the O
French O
woman O
licentious, O
the O
Italian O
passionate. O
"And O
negresses?" O
asked O
the O
clerk. O
"They O
are O
an O
artistic O
taste!" O
said O
Homais. O
"Waiter! O
two O
cups O
of O
coffee!" O
"Are O
we O
going?" O
at O
last O
asked O
Leon O
impatiently. O
"Ja!" O
But O
before O
leaving O
he O
wanted O
to O
see O
the O
proprietor O
of O
the O
establishment O
and O
made O
him O
a O
few O
compliments. O
Then O
the O
young O
man, O
to O
be O
alone, O
alleged O
he O
had O
some O
business O
engagement. O
"Ah! O
I O
will O
escort O
you," O
said O
Homais. O
And O
all O
the O
while O
he O
was O
walking O
through O
the O
streets O
with O
him O
he O
talked O
of O
his O
wife, O
his O
children; O
of O
their O
future, O
and O
of O
his O
business; O
told O
him O
in O
what O
a O
decayed O
condition O
it O
had O
formerly O
been, O
and O
to O
what O
a O
degree O
of O
perfection O
he O
had O
raised O
it. O
Arrived O
in O
front O
of O
the O
Hotel O
de O
Boulogne, O
Leon O
left O
him O
abruptly, O
ran O
up O
the O
stairs, O
and O
found O
his O
mistress O
in O
great O
excitement. O
At O
mention O
of O
the O
chemist O
she O
flew O
into O
a O
passion. O
He, O
however, O
piled O
up O
good O
reasons; O
it O
wasn't O
his O
fault; O
didn't O
she O
know O
Homais-- O
did O
she O
believe O
that O
he O
would O
prefer O
his O
company? O
But O
she O
turned O
away; O
he O
drew O
her O
back, O
and, O
sinking O
on O
his O
knees, O
clasped O
her O
waist O
with O
his O
arms O
in O
a O
languorous O
pose, O
full O
of O
concupiscence O
and O
supplication. O
She O
was O
standing O
up, O
her O
large O
flashing O
eyes O
looked O
at O
him O
seriously, O
almost O
terribly. O
Then O
tears O
obscured O
them, O
her O
red O
eyelids O
were O
lowered, O
she O
gave O
him O
her O
hands, O
and O
Leon O
was O
pressing O
them O
to O
his O
lips O
when O
a O
servant O
appeared O
to O
tell O
the O
gentleman O
that O
he O
was O
wanted. O
"You O
will O
come O
back?" O
she O
said. O
"Yes." O
"But O
when?" O
"Immediately." O
"It's O
a O
trick," O
said O
the O
chemist, O
when O
he O
saw O
Leon. O
"I O
wanted O
to O
interrupt O
this O
visit, O
that O
seemed O
to O
me O
to O
annoy O
you. O
Let's O
go O
and O
have O
a O
glass O
of O
garus O
at O
Bridoux'." O
Leon O
vowed O
that O
he O
must O
get O
back O
to O
his O
office. O
Then O
the O
druggist O
joked O
him O
about O
quill-drivers O
and O
the O
law. O
"Leave O
Cujas O
and O
Barthole O
alone O
a O
bit. O
Who O
the O
devil O
prevents O
you? O
Be O
a O
man! O
Let's O
go O
to O
Bridoux'. O
You'll O
see O
his O
dog. O
It's O
very O
interesting." O
AND O
AS O
THE O
CLERK O
STILL O
INSISTED-- O
"I'll O
go O
with O
you. O
I'll O
read O
a O
paper O
while O
I O
wait O
for O
you, O
or O
turn O
over O
the O
leaves O
of O
a O
'Code.'" O
Leon, O
bewildered O
by O
Emma's O
anger, O
Monsieur O
Homais' O
chatter, O
and, O
perhaps, O
by O
the O
heaviness O
of O
the O
luncheon, O
was O
undecided, O
and, O
as O
it O
were, O
fascinated O
by O
the O
chemist, O
who O
kept O
repeating-- O
"Let's O
go O
to O
Bridoux'. O
It's O
just O
by O
here, O
in O
the O
Rue O
Malpalu." O
Then, O
through O
cowardice, O
through O
stupidity, O
through O
that O
indefinable O
feeling O
that O
drags O
us O
into O
the O
most O
distasteful O
acts, O
he O
allowed O
himself O
to O
be O
led O
off O
to O
Bridoux', O
whom O
they O
found O
in O
his O
small O
yard, O
superintending O
three O
workmen, O
who O
panted O
as O
they O
turned O
the O
large O
wheel O
of O
a O
machine O
for O
making O
seltzer-water. O
Homais O
gave O
them O
some O
good O
advice. O
He O
embraced O
Bridoux; O
they O
took O
some O
garus. O
Twenty O
times O
Leon O
tried O
to O
escape, O
but O
the O
other O
seized O
him O
by O
the O
arm O
saying-- O
"Presently! O
I'm O
coming! O
We'll O
go O
to O
the O
'Fanal O
de O
Rouen' O
to O
see O
the O
fellows O
there. O
I'll O
introduce O
you O
to O
Thornassin." O
At O
last O
he O
managed O
to O
get O
rid O
of O
him, O
and O
rushed O
straight O
to O
the O
hotel. O
Emma O
was O
no O
longer O
there. O
She O
had O
just O
gone O
in O
a O
fit O
of O
anger. O
She O
detested O
him O
now. O
This O
failing O
to O
keep O
their O
rendezvous O
seemed O
to O
her O
an O
insult, O
and O
she O
tried O
to O
rake O
up O
other O
reasons O
to O
separate O
herself O
from O
him. O
He O
was O
incapable O
of O
heroism, O
weak, O
banal, O
more O
spiritless O
than O
a O
woman, O
avaricious O
too, O
and O
cowardly. O
Then, O
growing O
calmer, O
she O
at O
length O
discovered O
that O
she O
had, O
no O
doubt, O
calumniated O
him. O
But O
the O
disparaging O
of O
those O
we O
love O
always O
alienates O
us O
from O
them O
to O
some O
extent. O
We O
must O
not O
touch O
our O
idols; O
the O
gilt O
sticks O
to O
our O
fingers. O
They O
gradually O
came O
to O
talking O
more O
frequently O
of O
matters O
outside O
their O
love, O
and O
in O
the O
letters O
that O
Emma O
wrote O
him O
she O
spoke O
of O
flowers, O
verses, O
the O
moon O
and O
the O
stars, O
naive O
resources O
of O
a O
waning O
passion O
striving O
to O
keep O
itself O
alive O
by O
all O
external O
aids. O
She O
was O
constantly O
promising O
herself O
a O
profound O
felicity O
on O
her O
next O
journey. O
Then O
she O
confessed O
to O
herself O
that O
she O
felt O
nothing O
extraordinary. O
This O
disappointment O
quickly O
gave O
way O
to O
a O
new O
hope, O
and O
Emma O
returned O
to O
him O
more O
inflamed, O
more O
eager O
than O
ever. O
She O
undressed O
brutally, O
tearing O
off O
the O
thin O
laces O
of O
her O
corset O
that O
nestled O
around O
her O
hips O
like O
a O
gliding O
snake. O
She O
went O
on O
tiptoe, O
barefooted, O
to O
see O
once O
more O
that O
the O
door O
was O
closed, O
then, O
pale, O
serious, O
and, O
without O
speaking, O
with O
one O
movement, O
she O
threw O
herself O
upon O
his O
breast O
with O
a O
long O
shudder. O
Yet O
there O
was O
upon O
that O
brow O
covered O
with O
cold O
drops, O
on O
those O
quivering O
lips, O
in O
those O
wild O
eyes, O
in O
the O
strain O
of O
those O
arms, O
something O
vague O
and O
dreary O
that O
seemed O
to O
Leon O
to O
glide O
between O
them O
subtly O
as O
if O
to O
separate O
them. O
He O
did O
not O
dare O
to O
question O
her; O
but, O
seeing O
her O
so O
skilled, O
she O
must O
have O
passed, O
he O
thought, O
through O
every O
experience O
of O
suffering O
and O
of O
pleasure. O
What O
had O
once O
charmed O
now O
frightened O
him O
a O
little. O
Besides, O
he O
rebelled O
against O
his O
absorption, O
daily O
more O
marked, O
by O
her O
personality. O
He O
begrudged O
Emma O
this O
constant O
victory. O
He O
even O
strove O
not O
to O
love O
her; O
then, O
when O
he O
heard O
the O
creaking O
of O
her O
boots, O
he O
turned O
coward, O
like O
drunkards O
at O
the O
sight O
of O
strong O
drinks. O
She O
did O
not O
fail, O
in O
truth, O
to O
lavish O
all O
sorts O
of O
attentions O
upon O
him, O
from O
the O
delicacies O
of O
food O
to O
the O
coquettries O
of O
dress O
and O
languishing O
looks. O
She O
brought O
roses O
to O
her O
breast O
from O
Yonville, O
which O
she O
threw O
into O
his O
face; O
was O
anxious O
about O
his O
health, O
gave O
him O
advice O
as O
to O
his O
conduct; O
and, O
in O
order O
the O
more O
surely O
to O
keep O
her O
hold O
on O
him, O
hoping O
perhaps O
that O
heaven O
would O
take O
her O
part, O
she O
tied O
a O
medal O
of O
the O
Virgin O
round O
his O
neck. O
She O
inquired O
like O
a O
virtuous O
mother O
about O
his O
companions. O
She O
said O
to O
him-- O
"Don't O
see O
them; O
don't O
go O
out; O
think O
only O
of O
ourselves; O
love O
me!" O
She O
would O
have O
liked O
to O
be O
able O
to O
watch O
over O
his O
life; O
and O
the O
idea O
occurred O
to O
her O
of O
having O
him O
followed O
in O
the O
streets. O
Near O
the O
hotel O
there O
was O
always O
a O
kind O
of O
loafer O
who O
accosted O
travellers, O
and O
who O
would O
not O
refuse. O
But O
her O
pride O
revolted O
at O
this. O
"Bah! O
so O
much O
the O
worse. O
Let O
him O
deceive O
me! O
What O
does O
it O
matter O
to O
me? O
As O
If O
I O
cared O
for O
him!" O
One O
day, O
when O
they O
had O
parted O
early O
and O
she O
was O
returning O
alone O
along O
the O
boulevard, O
she O
saw O
the O
walls O
of O
her O
convent; O
then O
she O
sat O
down O
on O
a O
form O
in O
the O
shade O
of O
the O
elm-trees. O
How O
calm O
that O
time O
had O
been! O
How O
she O
longed O
for O
the O
ineffable O
sentiments O
of O
love O
that O
she O
had O
tried O
to O
figure O
to O
herself O
out O
of O
books! O
The O
first O
month O
of O
her O
marriage, O
her O
rides O
in O
the O
wood, O
the O
viscount O
that O
waltzed, O
and O
Lagardy O
singing, O
all O
repassed O
before O
her O
eyes. O
And O
Leon O
suddenly O
appeared O
to O
her O
as O
far O
off O
as O
the O
others. O
"Yet O
I O
love O
him," O
she O
said O
to O
herself. O
No O
matter! O
She O
was O
not O
happy-- O
she O
never O
had O
been. O
Whence O
came O
this O
insufficiency O
in O
life-- O
this O
instantaneous O
turning O
to O
decay O
of O
everything O
on O
which O
she O
leant? O
But O
if O
there O
were O
somewhere O
a O
being O
strong O
and O
beautiful, O
a O
valiant O
nature, O
full O
at O
once O
of O
exaltation O
and O
refinement, O
a O
poet's O
heart O
in O
an O
angel's O
form, O
a O
lyre O
with O
sounding O
chords O
ringing O
out O
elegiac O
epithalamia O
to O
heaven, O
why, O
perchance, O
should O
she O
not O
find O
him? O
Ah! O
how O
impossible! O
Besides, O
nothing O
was O
worth O
the O
trouble O
of O
seeking O
it; O
everything O
was O
a O
lie. O
Every O
smile O
hid O
a O
yawn O
of O
boredom, O
every O
joy O
a O
curse, O
all O
pleasure O
satiety, O
and O
the O
sweetest O
kisses O
left O
upon O
your O
lips O
only O
the O
unattainable O
desire O
for O
a O
greater O
delight. O
A O
metallic O
clang O
droned O
through O
the O
air, O
and O
four O
strokes O
were O
heard O
from O
the O
convent-clock. O
Four O
o'clock! O
And O
it O
seemed O
to O
her O
that O
she O
had O
been O
there O
on O
that O
form O
an O
eternity. O
But O
an O
infinity O
of O
passions O
may O
be O
contained O
in O
a O
minute, O
like O
a O
crowd O
in O
a O
small O
space. O
Emma O
lived O
all O
absorbed O
in O
hers, O
and O
troubled O
no O
more O
about O
money O
matters O
than O
an O
archduchess. O
Once, O
however, O
a O
wretched-looking O
man, O
rubicund O
and O
bald, O
came O
to O
her O
house, O
saying O
he O
had O
been O
sent O
by O
Monsieur O
Vincart O
of O
Rouen. O
He O
took O
out O
the O
pins O
that O
held O
together O
the O
side-pockets O
of O
his O
long O
green O
overcoat, O
stuck O
them O
into O
his O
sleeve, O
and O
politely O
handed O
her O
a O
paper. O
It O
was O
a O
bill O
for O
seven O
hundred O
francs, O
signed O
by O
her, O
and O
which O
Lheureux, O
in O
spite O
of O
all O
his O
professions, O
had O
paid O
away O
to O
Vincart. O
She O
sent O
her O
servant O
for O
him. O
He O
could O
not O
come. O
Then O
the O
stranger, O
who O
had O
remained O
standing, O
casting O
right O
and O
left O
curious O
glances, O
that O
his O
thick, O
fair O
eyebrows O
hid, O
asked O
with O
a O
naive O
air-- O
"What O
answer O
am O
I O
to O
take O
Monsieur O
Vincart?" O
"Oh," O
said O
Emma, O
"tell O
him O
that O
I O
haven't O
it. O
I O
will O
send O
next O
week; O
he O
must O
wait; O
yes, O
till O
next O
week." O
And O
the O
fellow O
went O
without O
another O
word. O
But O
the O
next O
day O
at O
twelve O
o'clock O
she O
received O
a O
summons, O
and O
the O
sight O
of O
the O
stamped O
paper, O
on O
which O
appeared O
several O
times O
in O
large O
letters, O
"Maitre O
Hareng, O
bailiff O
at O
Buchy," O
so O
frightened O
her O
that O
she O
rushed O
in O
hot O
haste O
to O
the O
linendraper's. O
She O
found O
him O
in O
his O
shop, O
doing O
up O
a O
parcel. O
"Your O
obedient!" O
he O
said; O
"I O
am O
at O
your O
service." O
But O
Lheureux, O
all O
the O
same, O
went O
on O
with O
his O
work, O
helped O
by O
a O
young O
girl O
of O
about O
thirteen, O
somewhat O
hunch-backed, O
who O
was O
at O
once O
his O
clerk O
and O
his O
servant. O
Then, O
his O
clogs O
clattering O
on O
the O
shop-boards, O
he O
went O
up O
in O
front O
of O
Madame O
Bovary O
to O
the O
first O
door, O
and O
introduced O
her O
into O
a O
narrow O
closet, O
where, O
in O
a O
large O
bureau O
in O
sapon-wood, O
lay O
some O
ledgers, O
protected O
by O
a O
horizontal O
padlocked O
iron O
bar. O
Against O
the O
wall, O
under O
some O
remnants O
of O
calico, O
one O
glimpsed O
a O
safe, O
but O
of O
such O
dimensions O
that O
it O
must O
contain O
something O
besides O
bills O
and O
money. O
Monsieur O
Lheureux, O
in O
fact, O
went O
in O
for O
pawnbroking, O
and O
it O
was O
there O
that O
he O
had O
put O
Madame O
Bovary's O
gold O
chain, O
together O
with O
the O
earrings O
of O
poor O
old O
Tellier, O
who, O
at O
last O
forced O
to O
sell O
out, O
had O
bought O
a O
meagre O
store O
of O
grocery O
at O
Quincampoix, O
where O
he O
was O
dying O
of O
catarrh O
amongst O
his O
candles, O
that O
were O
less O
yellow O
than O
his O
face. O
Lheureux O
sat O
down O
in O
a O
large O
cane O
arm-chair, O
saying: O
"What O
news?" O
"See!" O
And O
she O
showed O
him O
the O
paper. O
"Well O
how O
can O
I O
help O
it?" O
Then O
she O
grew O
angry, O
reminding O
him O
of O
the O
promise O
he O
had O
given O
not O
to O
pay O
away O
her O
bills. O
He O
acknowledged O
it. O
"But O
I O
was O
pressed O
myself; O
the O
knife O
was O
at O
my O
own O
throat." O
"And O
what O
will O
happen O
now?" O
she O
went O
on. O
"Oh, O
it's O
very O
simple; O
a O
judgment O
and O
then O
a O
distraint-- O
that's O
about O
it!" O
Emma O
kept O
down O
a O
desire O
to O
strike O
him, O
and O
asked O
gently O
if O
there O
was O
no O
way O
of O
quieting O
Monsieur O
Vincart. O
"I O
dare O
say! O
Quiet O
Vincart! O
You O
don't O
know O
him; O
he's O
more O
ferocious O
than O
an O
Arab!" O
Still O
Monsieur O
Lheureux O
must O
interfere. O
"Well, O
listen. O
It O
seems O
to O
me O
so O
far O
I've O
been O
very O
good O
to O
you." O
And O
opening O
one O
of O
his O
ledgers, O
"See," O
he O
said. O
Then O
running O
up O
the O
page O
with O
his O
finger, O
"Let's O
see! O
let's O
see! O
August O
3d, O
two O
hundred O
francs; O
June O
17th, O
a O
hundred O
and O
fifty; O
March O
23d, O
forty-six. O
In O
April O
-- O
" O
He O
stopped, O
as O
if O
afraid O
of O
making O
some O
mistake. O
"Not O
to O
speak O
of O
the O
bills O
signed O
by O
Monsieur O
Bovary, O
one O
for O
seven O
hundred O
francs, O
and O
another O
for O
three O
hundred. O
As O
to O
your O
little O
installments, O
with O
the O
interest, O
why, O
there's O
no O
end O
to O
'em; O
one O
gets O
quite O
muddled O
over O
'em. O
I'll O
have O
nothing O
more O
to O
do O
with O
it." O
She O
wept; O
she O
even O
called O
him O
"her O
good O
Monsieur O
Lheureux." O
But O
he O
always O
fell O
back O
upon O
"that O
rascal O
Vincart." O
Besides, O
he O
hadn't O
a O
brass O
farthing; O
no O
one O
was O
paying O
him O
now-a-days; O
they O
were O
eating O
his O
coat O
off O
his O
back; O
a O
poor O
shopkeeper O
like O
him O
couldn't O
advance O
money. O
Emma O
was O
silent, O
and O
Monsieur O
Lheureux, O
who O
was O
biting O
the O
feathers O
of O
a O
quill, O
no O
doubt O
became O
uneasy O
at O
her O
silence, O
for O
he O
went O
on-- O
"Unless O
one O
of O
these O
days O
I O
have O
something O
coming O
in, O
I O
might O
-- O
" O
"Besides," O
said O
she, O
"as O
soon O
as O
the O
balance O
of O
Barneville O
-- O
" O
"What!" O
And O
on O
hearing O
that O
Langlois O
had O
not O
yet O
paid O
he O
seemed O
much O
surprised. O
THEN O
IN O
A O
HONIED O
VOICE-- O
"And O
we O
agree, O
you O
say?" O
"Oh! O
to O
anything O
you O
like." O
On O
this O
he O
closed O
his O
eyes O
to O
reflect, O
wrote O
down O
a O
few O
figures, O
and O
declaring O
it O
would O
be O
very O
difficult O
for O
him, O
that O
the O
affair O
was O
shady, O
and O
that O
he O
was O
being O
bled, O
he O
wrote O
out O
four O
bills O
for O
two O
hundred O
and O
fifty O
francs O
each, O
to O
fall O
due O
month O
by O
month. O
"Provided O
that O
Vincart O
will O
listen O
to O
me! O
However, O
it's O
settled. O
I O
don't O
play O
the O
fool; O
I'm O
straight O
enough." O
Next O
he O
carelessly O
showed O
her O
several O
new O
goods, O
not O
one O
of O
which, O
however, O
was O
in O
his O
opinion O
worthy O
of O
madame. O
"When O
I O
think O
that O
there's O
a O
dress O
at O
threepence-halfpenny O
a O
yard, O
and O
warranted O
fast O
colours! O
And O
yet O
they O
actually O
swallow O
it! O
Of O
course O
you O
understand O
one O
doesn't O
tell O
them O
what O
it O
really O
is!" O
He O
hoped O
by O
this O
confession O
of O
dishonesty O
to O
others O
to O
quite O
convince O
her O
of O
his O
probity O
to O
her. O
Then O
he O
called O
her O
back O
to O
show O
her O
three O
yards O
of O
guipure O
that O
he O
had O
lately O
picked O
up O
"at O
a O
sale." O
"Isn't O
it O
lovely?" O
said O
Lheureux. O
"It O
is O
very O
much O
used O
now O
for O
the O
backs O
of O
arm-chairs. O
It's O
quite O
the O
rage." O
And, O
more O
ready O
than O
a O
juggler, O
he O
wrapped O
up O
the O
guipure O
in O
some O
blue O
paper O
and O
put O
it O
in O
Emma's O
hands. O
"But O
at O
least O
let O
me O
know O
-- O
" O
"Yes, O
another O
time," O
he O
replied, O
turning O
on O
his O
heel. O
That O
same O
evening O
she O
urged O
Bovary O
to O
write O
to O
his O
mother, O
to O
ask O
her O
to O
send O
as O
quickly O
as O
possible O
the O
whole O
of O
the O
balance O
due O
from O
the O
father's O
estate. O
The O
mother-in-law O
replied O
that O
she O
had O
nothing O
more, O
the O
winding O
up O
was O
over, O
and O
there O
was O
due O
to O
them O
besides O
Barneville O
an O
income O
of O
six O
hundred O
francs, O
that O
she O
would O
pay O
them O
punctually. O
Then O
Madame O
Bovary O
sent O
in O
accounts O
to O
two O
or O
three O
patients, O
and O
she O
made O
large O
use O
of O
this O
method, O
which O
was O
very O
successful. O
She O
was O
always O
careful O
to O
add O
a O
postscript: O
"Do O
not O
mention O
this O
to O
my O
husband; O
you O
know O
how O
proud O
he O
is. O
Excuse O
me. O
Yours O
obediently." O
There O
were O
some O
complaints; O
she O
intercepted O
them. O
To O
get O
money O
she O
began O
selling O
her O
old O
gloves, O
her O
old O
hats, O
the O
old O
odds O
and O
ends, O
and O
she O
bargained O
rapaciously, O
her O
peasant O
blood O
standing O
her O
in O
good O
stead. O
Then O
on O
her O
journey O
to O
town O
she O
picked O
up O
nick-nacks O
secondhand, O
that, O
in O
default O
of O
anyone O
else, O
Monsieur O
Lheureux O
would O
certainly O
take O
off O
her O
hands. O
She O
bought O
ostrich O
feathers, O
Chinese O
porcelain, O
and O
trunks; O
she O
borrowed O
from O
Felicite, O
from O
Madame O
Lefrancois, O
from O
the O
landlady O
at O
the O
Croix-Rouge, O
from O
everybody, O
no O
matter O
where. O
With O
the O
money O
she O
at O
last O
received O
from O
Barneville O
she O
paid O
two O
bills; O
the O
other O
fifteen O
hundred O
francs O
fell O
due. O
She O
renewed O
the O
bills, O
and O
thus O
it O
was O
continually. O
Sometimes, O
it O
is O
true, O
she O
tried O
to O
make O
a O
calculation, O
but O
she O
discovered O
things O
so O
exorbitant O
that O
she O
could O
not O
believe O
them O
possible. O
Then O
she O
recommenced, O
soon O
got O
confused, O
gave O
it O
all O
up, O
and O
thought O
no O
more O
about O
it. O
The O
house O
was O
very O
dreary O
now. O
Tradesmen O
were O
seen O
leaving O
it O
with O
angry O
faces. O
Handkerchiefs O
were O
lying O
about O
on O
the O
stoves, O
and O
little O
Berthe, O
to O
the O
great O
scandal O
of O
Madame O
Homais, O
wore O
stockings O
with O
holes O
in O
them. O
If O
Charles O
timidly O
ventured O
a O
remark, O
she O
answered O
roughly O
that O
it O
wasn't O
her O
fault. O
What O
was O
the O
meaning O
of O
all O
these O
fits O
of O
temper? O
He O
explained O
everything O
through O
her O
old O
nervous O
illness, O
and O
reproaching O
himself O
with O
having O
taken O
her O
infirmities O
for O
faults, O
accused O
himself O
of O
egotism, O
and O
longed O
to O
go O
and O
take O
her O
in O
his O
arms. O
"Ah, O
no!" O
he O
said O
to O
himself; O
"I O
should O
worry O
her." O
And O
he O
did O
not O
stir. O
After O
dinner O
he O
walked O
about O
alone O
in O
the O
garden; O
he O
took O
little O
Berthe O
on O
his O
knees, O
and O
unfolding O
his O
medical O
journal, O
tried O
to O
teach O
her O
to O
read. O
But O
the O
child, O
who O
never O
had O
any O
lessons, O
soon O
looked O
up O
with O
large, O
sad O
eyes O
and O
began O
to O
cry. O
Then O
he O
comforted O
her; O
went O
to O
fetch O
water O
in O
her O
can O
to O
make O
rivers O
on O
the O
sand O
path, O
or O
broke O
off O
branches O
from O
the O
privet O
hedges O
to O
plant O
trees O
in O
the O
beds. O
This O
did O
not O
spoil O
the O
garden O
much, O
all O
choked O
now O
with O
long O
weeds. O
They O
owed O
Lestiboudois O
for O
so O
many O
days. O
Then O
the O
child O
grew O
cold O
and O
asked O
for O
her O
mother. O
"Call O
the O
servant," O
said O
Charles. O
"You O
know, O
dearie, O
that O
mamma O
does O
not O
like O
to O
be O
disturbed." O
Autumn O
was O
setting O
in, O
and O
the O
leaves O
were O
already O
falling, O
as O
they O
did O
two O
years O
ago O
when O
she O
was O
ill. O
Where O
would O
it O
all O
end? O
And O
he O
walked O
up O
and O
down, O
his O
hands O
behind O
his O
back. O
Madame O
was O
in O
her O
room, O
which O
no O
one O
entered. O
She O
stayed O
there O
all O
day O
long, O
torpid, O
half O
dressed, O
and O
from O
time O
to O
time O
burning O
Turkish O
pastilles O
which O
she O
had O
bought O
at O
Rouen O
in O
an O
Algerian's O
shop. O
In O
order O
not O
to O
have O
at O
night O
this O
sleeping O
man O
stretched O
at O
her O
side, O
by O
dint O
of O
manoeuvring, O
she O
at O
last O
succeeded O
in O
banishing O
him O
to O
the O
second O
floor, O
while O
she O
read O
till O
morning O
extravagant O
books, O
full O
of O
pictures O
of O
orgies O
and O
thrilling O
situations. O
Often, O
seized O
with O
fear, O
she O
cried O
out, O
and O
Charles O
hurried O
to O
her. O
"Oh, O
go O
away!" O
she O
would O
say. O
Or O
at O
other O
times, O
consumed O
more O
ardently O
than O
ever O
by O
that O
inner O
flame O
to O
which O
adultery O
added O
fuel, O
panting, O
tremulous, O
all O
desire, O
she O
threw O
open O
her O
window, O
breathed O
in O
the O
cold O
air, O
shook O
loose O
in O
the O
wind O
her O
masses O
of O
hair, O
too O
heavy, O
and, O
gazing O
upon O
the O
stars, O
longed O
for O
some O
princely O
love. O
She O
thought O
of O
him, O
of O
Leon. O
She O
would O
then O
have O
given O
anything O
for O
a O
single O
one O
of O
those O
meetings O
that O
surfeited O
her. O
These O
were O
her O
gala O
days. O
She O
wanted O
them O
to O
be O
sumptuous, O
and O
when O
he O
alone O
could O
not O
pay O
the O
expenses, O
she O
made O
up O
the O
deficit O
liberally, O
which O
happened O
pretty O
well O
every O
time. O
He O
tried O
to O
make O
her O
understand O
that O
they O
would O
be O
quite O
as O
comfortable O
somewhere O
else, O
in O
a O
smaller O
hotel, O
but O
she O
always O
found O
some O
objection. O
One O
day O
she O
drew O
six O
small O
silver-gilt O
spoons O
from O
her O
bag O
(they O
were O
old O
Roualt's O
wedding O
present), O
begging O
him O
to O
pawn O
them O
at O
once O
for O
her, O
and O
Leon O
obeyed, O
though O
the O
proceeding O
annoyed O
him. O
He O
was O
afraid O
of O
compromising O
himself. O
Then, O
on, O
reflection, O
he O
began O
to O
think O
his O
mistress's O
ways O
were O
growing O
odd, O
and O
that O
they O
were O
perhaps O
not O
wrong O
in O
wishing O
to O
separate O
him O
from O
her. O
In O
fact O
someone O
had O
sent O
his O
mother O
a O
long O
anonymous O
letter O
to O
warn O
her O
that O
he O
was O
"ruining O
himself O
with O
a O
married O
woman," O
and O
the O
good O
lady O
at O
once O
conjuring O
up O
the O
eternal O
bugbear O
of O
families, O
the O
vague O
pernicious O
creature, O
the O
siren, O
the O
monster, O
who O
dwells O
fantastically O
in O
depths O
of O
love, O
wrote O
to O
Lawyer O
Dubocage, O
his O
employer, O
who O
behaved O
perfectly O
in O
the O
affair. O
He O
kept O
him O
for O
three O
quarters O
of O
an O
hour O
trying O
to O
open O
his O
eyes, O
to O
warn O
him O
of O
the O
abyss O
into O
which O
he O
was O
falling. O
Such O
an O
intrigue O
would O
damage O
him O
later O
on, O
when O
he O
set O
up O
for O
himself. O
He O
implored O
him O
to O
break O
with O
her, O
and, O
if O
he O
would O
not O
make O
this O
sacrifice O
in O
his O
own O
interest, O
to O
do O
it O
at O
least O
for O
his, O
Dubocage's O
sake. O
At O
last O
Leon O
swore O
he O
would O
not O
see O
Emma O
again, O
and O
he O
reproached O
himself O
with O
not O
having O
kept O
his O
word, O
considering O
all O
the O
worry O
and O
lectures O
this O
woman O
might O
still O
draw O
down O
upon O
him, O
without O
reckoning O
the O
jokes O
made O
by O
his O
companions O
as O
they O
sat O
round O
the O
stove O
in O
the O
morning. O
Besides, O
he O
was O
soon O
to O
be O
head O
clerk; O
it O
was O
time O
to O
settle O
down. O
So O
he O
gave O
up O
his O
flute, O
exalted O
sentiments, O
and O
poetry; O
for O
every O
bourgeois O
in O
the O
flush O
of O
his O
youth, O
were O
it O
but O
for O
a O
day, O
a O
moment, O
has O
believed O
himself O
capable O
of O
immense O
passions, O
of O
lofty O
enterprises. O
The O
most O
mediocre O
libertine O
has O
dreamed O
of O
sultanas; O
every O
notary O
bears O
within O
him O
the O
debris O
of O
a O
poet. O
He O
was O
bored O
now O
when O
Emma O
suddenly O
began O
to O
sob O
on O
his O
breast, O
and O
his O
heart, O
like O
the O
people O
who O
can O
only O
stand O
a O
certain O
amount O
of O
music, O
dozed O
to O
the O
sound O
of O
a O
love O
whose O
delicacies O
he O
no O
longer O
noted. O
They O
knew O
one O
another O
too O
well O
for O
any O
of O
those O
surprises O
of O
possession O
that O
increase O
its O
joys O
a O
hundred-fold. O
She O
was O
as O
sick O
of O
him O
as O
he O
was O
weary O
of O
her. O
Emma O
found O
again O
in O
adultery O
all O
the O
platitudes O
of O
marriage. O
But O
how O
to O
get O
rid O
of O
him? O
Then, O
though O
she O
might O
feel O
humiliated O
at O
the O
baseness O
of O
such O
enjoyment, O
she O
clung O
to O
it O
from O
habit O
or O
from O
corruption, O
and O
each O
day O
she O
hungered O
after O
them O
the O
more, O
exhausting O
all O
felicity O
in O
wishing O
for O
too O
much O
of O
it. O
She O
accused O
Leon O
of O
her O
baffled O
hopes, O
as O
if O
he O
had O
betrayed O
her; O
and O
she O
even O
longed O
for O
some O
catastrophe O
that O
would O
bring O
about O
their O
separation, O
since O
she O
had O
not O
the O
courage O
to O
make O
up O
her O
mind O
to O
it O
herself. O
She O
none O
the O
less O
went O
on O
writing O
him O
love O
letters, O
in O
virtue O
of O
the O
notion O
that O
a O
woman O
must O
write O
to O
her O
lover. O
But O
whilst O
she O
wrote O
it O
was O
another O
man O
she O
saw, O
a O
phantom O
fashioned O
out O
of O
her O
most O
ardent O
memories, O
of O
her O
finest O
reading, O
her O
strongest O
lusts, O
and O
at O
last O
he O
became O
so O
real, O
so O
tangible, O
that O
she O
palpitated O
wondering, O
without, O
however, O
the O
power O
to O
imagine O
him O
clearly, O
so O
lost O
was O
he, O
like O
a O
god, O
beneath O
the O
abundance O
of O
his O
attributes. O
He O
dwelt O
in O
that O
azure O
land O
where O
silk O
ladders O
hang O
from O
balconies O
under O
the O
breath O
of O
flowers, O
in O
the O
light O
of O
the O
moon. O
She O
felt O
him O
near O
her; O
he O
was O
coming, O
and O
would O
carry O
her O
right O
away O
in O
a O
kiss. O
Then O
she O
fell O
back O
exhausted, O
for O
these O
transports O
of O
vague O
love O
wearied O
her O
more O
than O
great O
debauchery. O
She O
now O
felt O
constant O
ache O
all O
over O
her. O
Often O
she O
even O
received O
summonses, O
stamped O
paper O
that O
she O
barely O
looked O
at. O
She O
would O
have O
liked O
not O
to O
be O
alive, O
or O
to O
be O
always O
asleep. O
On O
Mid-Lent O
she O
did O
not O
return O
to O
Yonville, O
but O
in O
the O
evening O
went O
to O
a O
masked O
ball. O
She O
wore O
velvet O
breeches, O
red O
stockings, O
a O
club O
wig, O
and O
three-cornered O
hat O
cocked O
on O
one O
side. O
She O
danced O
all O
night O
to O
the O
wild O
tones O
of O
the O
trombones; O
people O
gathered O
round O
her, O
and O
in O
the O
morning O
she O
found O
herself O
on O
the O
steps O
of O
the O
theatre O
together O
with O
five O
or O
six O
masks, O
debardeuses O
and O
sailors, O
Leon's O
comrades, O
who O
were O
talking O
about O
having O
supper. O
PEOPLE O
DRESSED O
AS O
LONGSHOREMEN. O
The O
neighbouring O
cafes O
were O
full. O
They O
caught O
sight O
of O
one O
on O
the O
harbour, O
a O
very O
indifferent O
restaurant, O
whose O
proprietor O
showed O
them O
to O
a O
little O
room O
on O
the O
fourth O
floor. O
The O
men O
were O
whispering O
in O
a O
corner, O
no O
doubt O
consorting O
about O
expenses. O
There O
were O
a O
clerk, O
two O
medical O
students, O
and O
a O
shopman-- O
what O
company O
for O
her! O
As O
to O
the O
women, O
Emma O
soon O
perceived O
from O
the O
tone O
of O
their O
voices O
that O
they O
must O
almost O
belong O
to O
the O
lowest O
class. O
Then O
she O
was O
frightened, O
pushed O
back O
her O
chair, O
and O
cast O
down O
her O
eyes. O
The O
others O
began O
to O
eat; O
she O
ate O
nothing. O
Her O
head O
was O
on O
fire, O
her O
eyes O
smarted, O
and O
her O
skin O
was O
ice-cold. O
In O
her O
head O
she O
seemed O
to O
feel O
the O
floor O
of O
the O
ball-room O
rebounding O
again O
beneath O
the O
rhythmical O
pulsation O
of O
the O
thousands O
of O
dancing O
feet. O
And O
now O
the O
smell O
of O
the O
punch, O
the O
smoke O
of O
the O
cigars, O
made O
her O
giddy. O
She O
fainted, O
and O
they O
carried O
her O
to O
the O
window. O
Day O
was O
breaking, O
and O
a O
great O
stain O
of O
purple O
colour O
broadened O
out O
in O
the O
pale O
horizon O
over O
the O
St. O
Catherine O
hills. O
The O
livid O
river O
was O
shivering O
in O
the O
wind; O
there O
was O
no O
one O
on O
the O
bridges; O
the O
street O
lamps O
were O
going O
out. O
She O
revived, O
and O
began O
thinking O
of O
Berthe O
asleep O
yonder O
in O
the O
servant's O
room. O
Then O
a O
cart O
filled O
with O
long O
strips O
of O
iron O
passed O
by, O
and O
made O
a O
deafening O
metallic O
vibration O
against O
the O
walls O
of O
the O
houses. O
She O
slipped O
away O
suddenly, O
threw O
off O
her O
costume, O
told O
Leon O
she O
must O
get O
back, O
and O
at O
last O
was O
alone O
at O
the O
Hotel O
de O
Boulogne. O
Everything, O
even O
herself, O
was O
now O
unbearable O
to O
her. O
She O
wished O
that, O
taking O
wing O
like O
a O
bird, O
she O
could O
fly O
somewhere, O
far O
away O
to O
regions O
of O
purity, O
and O
there O
grow O
young O
again. O
She O
went O
out, O
crossed O
the O
Boulevard, O
the O
Place O
Cauchoise, O
and O
the O
Faubourg, O
as O
far O
as O
an O
open O
street O
that O
overlooked O
some O
gardens. O
She O
walked O
rapidly; O
the O
fresh O
air O
calming O
her; O
and, O
little O
by O
little, O
the O
faces O
of O
the O
crowd, O
the O
masks, O
the O
quadrilles, O
the O
lights, O
the O
supper, O
those O
women, O
all O
disappeared O
like O
mists O
fading O
away. O
Then, O
reaching O
the O
"Croix-Rouge," O
she O
threw O
herself O
on O
the O
bed O
in O
her O
little O
room O
on O
the O
second O
floor, O
where O
there O
were O
pictures O
of O
the O
"Tour O
de O
Nesle." O
At O
four O
o'clock O
Hivert O
awoke O
her. O
When O
she O
got O
home, O
Felicite O
showed O
her O
behind O
the O
clock O
a O
grey O
paper. O
SHE O
READ-- O
"In O
virtue O
of O
the O
seizure O
in O
execution O
of O
a O
judgment." O
What O
judgment? O
As O
a O
matter O
of O
fact, O
the O
evening O
before O
another O
paper O
had O
been O
brought O
that O
she O
had O
not O
yet O
seen, O
and O
she O
was O
stunned O
by O
these O
words-- O
"By O
order O
of O
the O
king, O
law, O
and O
justice, O
to O
Madame O
Bovary." O
Then, O
skipping O
several O
lines, O
she O
read, O
"Within O
twenty-four O
hours, O
without O
fail O
-- O
" O
But O
what? O
"To O
pay O
the O
sum O
of O
eight O
thousand O
francs." O
And O
there O
was O
even O
at O
the O
bottom, O
"She O
will O
be O
constrained O
thereto O
by O
every O
form O
of O
law, O
and O
notably O
by O
a O
writ O
of O
distraint O
on O
her O
furniture O
and O
effects." O
What O
was O
to O
be O
done? O
In O
twenty-four O
hours-- O
tomorrow. O
Lheureux, O
she O
thought, O
wanted O
to O
frighten O
her O
again; O
for O
she O
saw O
through O
all O
his O
devices, O
the O
object O
of O
his O
kindnesses. O
What O
reassured O
her O
was O
the O
very O
magnitude O
of O
the O
sum. O
However, O
by O
dint O
of O
buying O
and O
not O
paying, O
of O
borrowing, O
signing O
bills, O
and O
renewing O
these O
bills O
that O
grew O
at O
each O
new O
falling-in, O
she O
had O
ended O
by O
preparing O
a O
capital O
for O
Monsieur O
Lheureux O
which O
he O
was O
impatiently O
awaiting O
for O
his O
speculations. O
She O
presented O
herself O
at O
his O
place O
with O
an O
offhand O
air. O
"You O
know O
what O
has O
happened O
to O
me? O
No O
doubt O
it's O
a O
joke!" O
"How O
so?" O
He O
turned O
away O
slowly, O
and, O
folding O
his O
arms, O
said O
to O
her-- O
"My O
good O
lady, O
did O
you O
think O
I O
should O
go O
on O
to O
all O
eternity O
being O
your O
purveyor O
and O
banker, O
for O
the O
love O
of O
God? O
Now O
be O
just. O
I O
must O
get O
back O
what O
I've O
laid O
out. O
Now O
be O
just." O
She O
cried O
out O
against O
the O
debt. O
"Ah! O
so O
much O
the O
worse. O
The O
court O
has O
admitted O
it. O
There's O
a O
judgment. O
It's O
been O
notified O
to O
you. O
Besides, O
it O
isn't O
my O
fault. O
It's O
Vincart's." O
"Could O
you O
not-- O
?" O
"Oh, O
nothing O
whatever." O
"But O
still, O
now O
talk O
it O
over." O
And O
she O
began O
beating O
about O
the O
bush; O
she O
had O
known O
nothing O
about O
it; O
it O
was O
a O
surprise. O
"Whose O
fault O
is O
that?" O
said O
Lheureux, O
bowing O
ironically. O
"While O
I'm O
slaving O
like O
a O
nigger, O
you O
go O
gallivanting O
about." O
"Ah! O
no O
lecturing." O
"It O
never O
does O
any O
harm," O
he O
replied. O
She O
turned O
coward; O
she O
implored O
him; O
she O
even O
pressed O
her O
pretty O
white O
and O
slender O
hand O
against O
the O
shopkeeper's O
knee. O
"There, O
that'll O
do! O
Anyone'd O
think O
you O
wanted O
to O
seduce O
me!" O
"You O
are O
a O
wretch!" O
she O
cried. O
"Oh, O
oh! O
go O
it! O
go O
it!" O
"I O
will O
show O
you O
up. O
I O
shall O
tell O
my O
husband." O
"All O
right! O
I O
too. O
I'll O
show O
your O
husband O
something." O
And O
Lheureux O
drew O
from O
his O
strong O
box O
the O
receipt O
for O
eighteen O
hundred O
francs O
that O
she O
had O
given O
him O
when O
Vincart O
had O
discounted O
the O
bills. O
"Do O
you O
think," O
he O
added, O
"that O
he'll O
not O
understand O
your O
little O
theft, O
the O
poor O
dear O
man?" O
She O
collapsed, O
more O
overcome O
than O
if O
felled O
by O
the O
blow O
of O
a O
pole-axe. O
He O
was O
walking O
up O
and O
down O
from O
the O
window O
to O
the O
bureau, O
repeating O
all O
the O
while-- O
"Ah! O
I'll O
show O
him! O
I'll O
show O
him!" O
Then O
he O
approached O
her, O
and O
in O
a O
soft O
voice O
said-- O
"It O
isn't O
pleasant, O
I O
know; O
but, O
after O
all, O
no O
bones O
are O
broken, O
and, O
since O
that O
is O
the O
only O
way O
that O
is O
left O
for O
you O
paying O
back O
my O
money O
-- O
" O
"But O
where O
am O
I O
to O
get O
any?" O
said O
Emma, O
wringing O
her O
hands. O
"Bah! O
when O
one O
has O
friends O
like O
you!" O
And O
he O
looked O
at O
her O
in O
so O
keen, O
so O
terrible O
a O
fashion, O
that O
she O
shuddered O
to O
her O
very O
heart. O
"I O
promise O
you," O
she O
said, O
"to O
sign O
-- O
" O
"I've O
enough O
of O
your O
signatures." O
"I O
will O
sell O
something." O
"Get O
along!" O
he O
said, O
shrugging O
his O
shoulders; O
"you've O
not O
got O
anything." O
And O
he O
called O
through O
the O
peep-hole O
that O
looked O
down O
into O
the O
shop-- O
"Annette, O
don't O
forget O
the O
three O
coupons O
of O
No. O
14." O
The O
servant O
appeared. O
Emma O
understood, O
and O
asked O
how O
much O
money O
would O
be O
wanted O
to O
put O
a O
stop O
to O
the O
proceedings. O
"It O
is O
too O
late." O
"But O
if O
I O
brought O
you O
several O
thousand O
francs O
-- O
a O
quarter O
of O
the O
sum O
-- O
a O
third-- O
perhaps O
the O
whole?" O
"No; O
it's O
no O
use!" O
And O
he O
pushed O
her O
gently O
towards O
the O
staircase. O
"I O
implore O
you, O
Monsieur O
Lheureux, O
just O
a O
few O
days O
more!" O
She O
was O
sobbing. O
"There! O
tears O
now!" O
"You O
are O
driving O
me O
to O
despair!" O
"What O
do O
I O
care?" O
said O
he, O
shutting O
the O
door. O
CHAPTER O
SEVEN O
She O
was O
stoical O
the O
next O
day O
when O
Maitre O
Hareng, O
the O
bailiff, O
with O
two O
assistants, O
presented O
himself O
at O
her O
house O
to O
draw O
up O
the O
inventory O
for O
the O
distraint. O
They O
began O
with O
Bovary's O
consulting-room, O
and O
did O
not O
write O
down O
the O
phrenological O
head, O
which O
was O
considered O
an O
"instrument O
of O
his O
profession"; O
but O
in O
the O
kitchen O
they O
counted O
the O
plates; O
the O
saucepans, O
the O
chairs, O
the O
candlesticks, O
and O
in O
the O
bedroom O
all O
the O
nick-nacks O
on O
the O
whatnot. O
They O
examined O
her O
dresses, O
the O
linen, O
the O
dressing-room; O
and O
her O
whole O
existence O
to O
its O
most O
intimate O
details, O
was, O
like O
a O
corpse O
on O
whom O
a O
post-mortem O
is O
made, O
outspread O
before O
the O
eyes O
of O
these O
three O
men. O
Maitre O
Hareng, O
buttoned O
up O
in O
his O
thin O
black O
coat, O
wearing O
a O
white O
choker O
and O
very O
tight O
foot-straps, O
repeated O
from O
time O
to O
time-- O
"Allow O
me, O
madame. O
You O
allow O
me?" O
Often O
he O
uttered O
exclamations. O
"Charming! O
very O
pretty." O
Then O
he O
began O
writing O
again, O
dipping O
his O
pen O
into O
the O
horn O
inkstand O
in O
his O
left O
hand. O
When O
they O
had O
done O
with O
the O
rooms O
they O
went O
up O
to O
the O
attic. O
She O
kept O
a O
desk O
there O
in O
which O
Rodolphe's O
letters O
were O
locked. O
It O
had O
to O
be O
opened. O
"Ah! O
a O
correspondence," O
said O
Maitre O
Hareng, O
with O
a O
discreet O
smile. O
"But O
allow O
me, O
for O
I O
must O
make O
sure O
the O
box O
contains O
nothing O
else." O
And O
he O
tipped O
up O
the O
papers O
lightly, O
as O
if O
to O
shake O
out O
napoleons. O
Then O
she O
grew O
angered O
to O
see O
this O
coarse O
hand, O
with O
fingers O
red O
and O
pulpy O
like O
slugs, O
touching O
these O
pages O
against O
which O
her O
heart O
had O
beaten. O
They O
went O
at O
last. O
Felicite O
came O
back. O
Emma O
had O
sent O
her O
out O
to O
watch O
for O
Bovary O
in O
order O
to O
keep O
him O
off, O
and O
they O
hurriedly O
installed O
the O
man O
in O
possession O
under O
the O
roof, O
where O
he O
swore O
he O
would O
remain. O
During O
the O
evening O
Charles O
seemed O
to O
her O
careworn. O
Emma O
watched O
him O
with O
a O
look O
of O
anguish, O
fancying O
she O
saw O
an O
accusation O
in O
every O
line O
of O
his O
face. O
Then, O
when O
her O
eyes O
wandered O
over O
the O
chimney-piece O
ornamented O
with O
Chinese O
screens, O
over O
the O
large O
curtains, O
the O
armchairs, O
all O
those O
things, O
in O
a O
word, O
that O
had, O
softened O
the O
bitterness O
of O
her O
life, O
remorse O
seized O
her O
or O
rather O
an O
immense O
regret, O
that, O
far O
from O
crushing, O
irritated O
her O
passion. O
Charles O
placidly O
poked O
the O
fire, O
both O
his O
feet O
on O
the O
fire-dogs. O
Once O
the O
man, O
no O
doubt O
bored O
in O
his O
hiding-place, O
made O
a O
slight O
noise. O
"Is O
anyone O
walking O
upstairs?" O
said O
Charles. O
"No," O
she O
replied; O
"it O
is O
a O
window O
that O
has O
been O
left O
open, O
and O
is O
rattling O
in O
the O
wind." O
The O
next O
day, O
Sunday, O
she O
went O
to O
Rouen O
to O
call O
on O
all O
the O
brokers O
whose O
names O
she O
knew. O
They O
were O
at O
their O
country-places O
or O
on O
journeys. O
She O
was O
not O
discouraged; O
and O
those O
whom O
she O
did O
manage O
to O
see O
she O
asked O
for O
money, O
declaring O
she O
must O
have O
some, O
and O
that O
she O
would O
pay O
it O
back. O
Some O
laughed O
in O
her O
face; O
all O
refused. O
At O
two O
o'clock O
she O
hurried O
to O
Leon, O
and O
knocked O
at O
the O
door. O
No O
one O
answered. O
At O
length O
he O
appeared. O
"What O
brings O
you O
here?" O
"Do O
I O
disturb O
you?" O
"No; O
but O
-- O
" O
And O
he O
admitted O
that O
his O
landlord O
didn't O
like O
his O
having O
"women" O
there. O
"I O
must O
speak O
to O
you," O
she O
went O
on. O
Then O
he O
took O
down O
the O
key, O
but O
she O
stopped O
him. O
"No, O
no! O
Down O
there, O
in O
our O
home!" O
And O
they O
went O
to O
their O
room O
at O
the O
Hotel O
de O
Boulogne. O
On O
arriving O
she O
drank O
off O
a O
large O
glass O
of O
water. O
She O
was O
very O
pale. O
She O
said O
to O
him-- O
"Leon, O
you O
will O
do O
me O
a O
service?" O
And, O
shaking O
him O
by O
both O
hands O
that O
she O
grasped O
tightly, O
she O
added-- O
"Listen, O
I O
want O
eight O
thousand O
francs." O
"But O
you O
are O
mad!" O
"Not O
yet." O
And O
thereupon, O
telling O
him O
the O
story O
of O
the O
distraint, O
she O
explained O
her O
distress O
to O
him; O
for O
Charles O
knew O
nothing O
of O
it; O
her O
mother-in-law O
detested O
her; O
old O
Rouault O
could O
do O
nothing; O
but O
he, O
Leon, O
he O
would O
set O
about O
finding O
this O
indispensable O
sum. O
"How O
on O
earth O
can O
I?" O
"What O
a O
coward O
you O
are!" O
she O
cried. O
Then O
he O
said O
stupidly, O
"You O
are O
exaggerating O
the O
difficulty. O
Perhaps, O
with O
a O
thousand O
crowns O
or O
so O
the O
fellow O
could O
be O
stopped." O
All O
the O
greater O
reason O
to O
try O
and O
do O
something; O
it O
was O
impossible O
that O
they O
could O
not O
find O
three O
thousand O
francs. O
Besides, O
Leon, O
could O
be O
security O
instead O
of O
her. O
"Go, O
try, O
try! O
I O
will O
love O
you O
so!" O
He O
went O
out, O
and O
came O
back O
at O
the O
end O
of O
an O
hour, O
saying, O
with O
solemn O
face-- O
"I O
have O
been O
to O
three O
people O
with O
no O
success." O
Then O
they O
remained O
sitting O
face O
to O
face O
at O
the O
two O
chimney O
corners, O
motionless, O
in O
silence. O
Emma O
shrugged O
her O
shoulders O
as O
she O
stamped O
her O
feet. O
He O
heard O
her O
murmuring-- O
"If O
I O
were O
in O
your O
place O
I O
should O
soon O
get O
some." O
"But O
where?" O
"At O
your O
office." O
And O
she O
looked O
at O
him. O
An O
infernal O
boldness O
looked O
out O
from O
her O
burning O
eyes, O
and O
their O
lids O
drew O
close O
together O
with O
a O
lascivious O
and O
encouraging O
look, O
so O
that O
the O
young O
man O
felt O
himself O
growing O
weak O
beneath O
the O
mute O
will O
of O
this O
woman O
who O
was O
urging O
him O
to O
a O
crime. O
Then O
he O
was O
afraid, O
and O
to O
avoid O
any O
explanation O
he O
smote O
his O
forehead, O
crying-- O
"Morel O
is O
to O
come O
back O
to-night; O
he O
will O
not O
refuse O
me, O
I O
hope" O
(this O
was O
one O
of O
his O
friends, O
the O
son O
of O
a O
very O
rich O
merchant); O
"and O
I O
will O
bring O
it O
you O
to-morrow," O
he O
added. O
Emma O
did O
not O
seem O
to O
welcome O
this O
hope O
with O
all O
the O
joy O
he O
had O
expected. O
Did O
she O
suspect O
the O
lie? O
He O
went O
on, O
blushing-- O
"However, O
if O
you O
don't O
see O
me O
by O
three O
o'clock O
do O
not O
wait O
for O
me, O
my O
darling. O
I O
must O
be O
off O
now; O
forgive O
me! O
Goodbye!" O
He O
pressed O
her O
hand, O
but O
it O
felt O
quite O
lifeless. O
Emma O
had O
no O
strength O
left O
for O
any O
sentiment. O
Four O
o'clock O
struck, O
and O
she O
rose O
to O
return O
to O
Yonville, O
mechanically O
obeying O
the O
force O
of O
old O
habits. O
The O
weather O
was O
fine. O
It O
was O
one O
of O
those O
March O
days, O
clear O
and O
sharp, O
when O
the O
sun O
shines O
in O
a O
perfectly O
white O
sky. O
The O
Rouen O
folk, O
in O
Sunday-clothes, O
were O
walking O
about O
with O
happy O
looks. O
She O
reached O
the O
Place O
du O
Parvis. O
People O
were O
coming O
out O
after O
vespers; O
the O
crowd O
flowed O
out O
through O
the O
three O
doors O
like O
a O
stream O
through O
the O
three O
arches O
of O
a O
bridge, O
and O
in O
the O
middle O
one, O
more O
motionless O
than O
a O
rock, O
stood O
the O
beadle. O
Then O
she O
remembered O
the O
day O
when, O
all O
anxious O
and O
full O
of O
hope, O
she O
had O
entered O
beneath O
this O
large O
nave, O
that O
had O
opened O
out O
before O
her, O
less O
profound O
than O
her O
love; O
and O
she O
walked O
on O
weeping O
beneath O
her O
veil, O
giddy, O
staggering, O
almost O
fainting. O
"Take O
care!" O
cried O
a O
voice O
issuing O
from O
the O
gate O
of O
a O
courtyard O
that O
was O
thrown O
open. O
She O
stopped O
to O
let O
pass O
a O
black O
horse, O
pawing O
the O
ground O
between O
the O
shafts O
of O
a O
tilbury, O
driven O
by O
a O
gentleman O
in O
sable O
furs. O
Who O
was O
it? O
She O
knew O
him. O
The O
carriage O
darted O
by O
and O
disappeared. O
Why, O
it O
was O
he-- O
the O
Viscount. O
She O
turned O
away; O
the O
street O
was O
empty. O
She O
was O
so O
overwhelmed, O
so O
sad, O
that O
she O
had O
to O
lean O
against O
a O
wall O
to O
keep O
herself O
from O
falling. O
Then O
she O
thought O
she O
had O
been O
mistaken. O
Anyhow, O
she O
did O
not O
know. O
All O
within O
her O
and O
around O
her O
was O
abandoning O
her. O
She O
felt O
lost, O
sinking O
at O
random O
into O
indefinable O
abysses, O
and O
it O
was O
almost O
with O
joy O
that, O
on O
reaching O
the O
"Croix-Rouge," O
she O
saw O
the O
good O
Homais, O
who O
was O
watching O
a O
large O
box O
full O
of O
pharmaceutical O
stores O
being O
hoisted O
on O
to O
the O
"Hirondelle." O
In O
his O
hand O
he O
held O
tied O
in O
a O
silk O
handkerchief O
six O
cheminots O
for O
his O
wife. O
Madame O
Homais O
was O
very O
fond O
of O
these O
small, O
heavy O
turban-shaped O
loaves, O
that O
are O
eaten O
in O
Lent O
with O
salt O
butter; O
a O
last O
vestige O
of O
Gothic O
food O
that O
goes O
back, O
perhaps, O
to O
the O
time O
of O
the O
Crusades, O
and O
with O
which O
the O
robust O
Normans O
gorged O
themselves O
of O
yore, O
fancying O
they O
saw O
on O
the O
table, O
in O
the O
light O
of O
the O
yellow O
torches, O
between O
tankards O
of O
hippocras O
and O
huge O
boars' O
heads, O
the O
heads O
of O
Saracens O
to O
be O
devoured. O
The O
druggist's O
wife O
crunched O
them O
up O
as O
they O
had O
done-- O
heroically, O
despite O
her O
wretched O
teeth. O
And O
so O
whenever O
Homais O
journeyed O
to O
town, O
he O
never O
failed O
to O
bring O
her O
home O
some O
that O
he O
bought O
at O
the O
great O
baker's O
in O
the O
Rue O
Massacre. O
"Charmed O
to O
see O
you," O
he O
said, O
offering O
Emma O
a O
hand O
to O
help O
her O
into O
the O
"Hirondelle." O
Then O
he O
hung O
up O
his O
cheminots O
to O
the O
cords O
of O
the O
netting, O
and O
remained O
bare-headed O
in O
an O
attitude O
pensive O
and O
Napoleonic. O
But O
when O
the O
blind O
man O
appeared O
as O
usual O
at O
the O
foot O
of O
the O
hill O
he O
exclaimed-- O
"I O
can't O
understand O
why O
the O
authorities O
tolerate O
such O
culpable O
industries. O
Such O
unfortunates O
should O
be O
locked O
up O
and O
forced O
to O
work. O
Progress, O
my O
word! O
creeps O
at O
a O
snail's O
pace. O
We O
are O
floundering O
about O
in O
mere O
barbarism." O
The O
blind O
man O
held O
out O
his O
hat, O
that O
flapped O
about O
at O
the O
door, O
as O
if O
it O
were O
a O
bag O
in O
the O
lining O
that O
had O
come O
unnailed. O
"This," O
said O
the O
chemist, O
"is O
a O
scrofulous O
affection." O
And O
though O
he O
knew O
the O
poor O
devil, O
he O
pretended O
to O
see O
him O
for O
the O
first O
time, O
murmured O
something O
about O
"cornea," O
"opaque O
cornea," O
"sclerotic," O
"facies," O
then O
asked O
him O
in O
a O
paternal O
tone-- O
"My O
friend, O
have O
you O
long O
had O
this O
terrible O
infirmity? O
Instead O
of O
getting O
drunk O
at O
the O
public, O
you'd O
do O
better O
to O
die O
yourself." O
He O
advised O
him O
to O
take O
good O
wine, O
good O
beer, O
and O
good O
joints. O
The O
blind O
man O
went O
on O
with O
his O
song; O
he O
seemed, O
moreover, O
almost O
idiotic. O
At O
last O
MONSIEUR O
HOMAIS O
OPENED O
HIS O
PURSE-- O
"Now O
there's O
a O
sou; O
give O
me O
back O
two O
lairds, O
and O
don't O
forget O
my O
advice: O
you'll O
be O
the O
better O
for O
it." O
Hivert O
openly O
cast O
some O
doubt O
on O
the O
efficacy O
of O
it. O
But O
the O
druggist O
said O
that O
he O
would O
cure O
himself O
with O
an O
antiphlogistic O
pomade O
of O
his O
own O
composition, O
and O
he O
gave O
his O
address-- O
"Monsieur O
Homais, O
near O
the O
market, O
pretty O
well O
known." O
"Now," O
said O
Hivert, O
"for O
all O
this O
trouble O
you'll O
give O
us O
your O
performance." O
The O
blind O
man O
sank O
down O
on O
his O
haunches, O
with O
his O
head O
thrown O
back, O
whilst O
he O
rolled O
his O
greenish O
eyes, O
lolled O
out O
his O
tongue, O
and O
rubbed O
his O
stomach O
with O
both O
hands O
as O
he O
uttered O
a O
kind O
of O
hollow O
yell O
like O
a O
famished O
dog. O
Emma, O
filled O
with O
disgust, O
threw O
him O
over O
her O
shoulder O
a O
five-franc O
piece. O
It O
was O
all O
her O
fortune. O
It O
seemed O
to O
her O
very O
fine O
thus O
to O
throw O
it O
away. O
The O
coach O
had O
gone O
on O
again O
when O
suddenly O
Monsieur O
Homais O
leant O
out O
through O
the O
window, O
crying-- O
"No O
farinaceous O
or O
milk O
food, O
wear O
wool O
next O
the O
skin, O
and O
expose O
the O
diseased O
parts O
to O
the O
smoke O
of O
juniper O
berries." O
The O
sight O
of O
the O
well-known O
objects O
that O
defiled O
before O
her O
eyes O
gradually O
diverted O
Emma O
from O
her O
present O
trouble. O
An O
intolerable O
fatigue O
overwhelmed O
her, O
and O
she O
reached O
her O
home O
stupefied, O
discouraged, O
almost O
asleep. O
"Come O
what O
may O
come!" O
she O
said O
to O
herself. O
"And O
then, O
who O
knows? O
Why, O
at O
any O
moment O
could O
not O
some O
extraordinary O
event O
occur? O
Lheureux O
even O
might O
die!" O
At O
nine O
o'clock O
in O
the O
morning O
she O
was O
awakened O
by O
the O
sound O
of O
voices O
in O
the O
Place. O
There O
was O
a O
crowd O
round O
the O
market O
reading O
a O
large O
bill O
fixed O
to O
one O
of O
the O
posts, O
and O
she O
saw O
Justin, O
who O
was O
climbing O
on O
to O
a O
stone O
and O
tearing O
down O
the O
bill. O
But O
at O
this O
moment O
the O
rural O
guard O
seized O
him O
by O
the O
collar. O
Monsieur O
Homais O
came O
out O
of O
his O
shop, O
and O
Mere O
Lefrangois, O
in O
the O
midst O
of O
the O
crowd, O
seemed O
to O
be O
perorating. O
"Madame! O
madame!" O
cried O
Felicite, O
running O
in, O
"it's O
abominable!" O
And O
the O
poor O
girl, O
deeply O
moved, O
handed O
her O
a O
yellow O
paper O
that O
she O
had O
just O
torn O
off O
the O
door. O
Emma O
read O
with O
a O
glance O
that O
all O
her O
furniture O
was O
for O
sale. O
Then O
they O
looked O
at O
one O
another O
silently. O
The O
servant O
and O
mistress O
had O
no O
secret O
one O
from O
the O
other. O
At O
last O
Felicite O
sighed-- O
"If O
I O
were O
you, O
madame, O
I O
should O
go O
to O
Monsieur O
Guillaumin." O
"Do O
you O
think O
-- O
" O
AND O
THIS O
QUESTION O
MEANT O
TO O
SAY-- O
"You O
who O
know O
the O
house O
through O
the O
servant, O
has O
the O
master O
spoken O
sometimes O
of O
me?" O
"Yes, O
you'd O
do O
well O
to O
go O
there." O
She O
dressed, O
put O
on O
her O
black O
gown, O
and O
her O
hood O
with O
jet O
beads, O
and O
that O
she O
might O
not O
be O
seen O
(there O
was O
still O
a O
crowd O
on O
the O
Place), O
she O
took O
the O
path O
by O
the O
river, O
outside O
the O
village. O
She O
reached O
the O
notary's O
gate O
quite O
breathless. O
The O
sky O
was O
sombre, O
and O
a O
little O
snow O
was O
falling. O
At O
the O
sound O
of O
the O
bell, O
Theodore O
in O
a O
red O
waistcoat O
appeared O
on O
the O
steps; O
he O
came O
to O
open O
the O
door O
almost O
familiarly, O
as O
to O
an O
acquaintance, O
and O
showed O
her O
into O
the O
dining-room. O
A O
large O
porcelain O
stove O
crackled O
beneath O
a O
cactus O
that O
filled O
up O
the O
niche O
in O
the O
wall, O
and O
in O
black O
wood O
frames O
against O
the O
oak-stained O
paper O
hung O
Steuben's O
"Esmeralda" O
and O
Schopin's O
"Potiphar." O
The O
ready-laid O
table, O
the O
two O
silver O
chafing-dishes, O
the O
crystal O
door-knobs, O
the O
parquet O
and O
the O
furniture, O
all O
shone O
with O
a O
scrupulous, O
English O
cleanliness; O
the O
windows O
were O
ornamented O
at O
each O
corner O
with O
stained O
glass. O
"Now O
this," O
thought O
Emma, O
"is O
the O
dining-room O
I O
ought O
to O
have." O
The O
notary O
came O
in O
pressing O
his O
palm-leaf O
dressing-gown O
to O
his O
breast O
with O
his O
left O
arm, O
while O
with O
the O
other O
hand O
he O
raised O
and O
quickly O
put O
on O
again O
his O
brown O
velvet O
cap, O
pretentiously O
cocked O
on O
the O
right O
side, O
whence O
looked O
out O
the O
ends O
of O
three O
fair O
curls O
drawn O
from O
the O
back O
of O
the O
head, O
following O
the O
line O
of O
his O
bald O
skull. O
After O
he O
had O
offered O
her O
a O
seat O
he O
sat O
down O
to O
breakfast, O
apologising O
profusely O
for O
his O
rudeness. O
"I O
have O
come," O
she O
said, O
"to O
beg O
you, O
sir O
-- O
" O
"What, O
madame? O
I O
am O
listening." O
And O
she O
began O
explaining O
her O
position O
to O
him. O
Monsieur O
Guillaumin O
knew O
it, O
being O
secretly O
associated O
with O
the O
linendraper, O
from O
whom O
he O
always O
got O
capital O
for O
the O
loans O
on O
mortgages O
that O
he O
was O
asked O
to O
make. O
So O
he O
knew O
(and O
better O
than O
she O
herself) O
the O
long O
story O
of O
the O
bills, O
small O
at O
first, O
bearing O
different O
names O
as O
endorsers, O
made O
out O
at O
long O
dates, O
and O
constantly O
renewed O
up O
to O
the O
day, O
when, O
gathering O
together O
all O
the O
protested O
bills, O
the O
shopkeeper O
had O
bidden O
his O
friend O
Vincart O
take O
in O
his O
own O
name O
all O
the O
necessary O
proceedings, O
not O
wishing O
to O
pass O
for O
a O
tiger O
with O
his O
fellow-citizens. O
She O
mingled O
her O
story O
with O
recriminations O
against O
Lheureux, O
to O
which O
the O
notary O
replied O
from O
time O
to O
time O
with O
some O
insignificant O
word. O
Eating O
his O
cutlet O
and O
drinking O
his O
tea, O
he O
buried O
his O
chin O
in O
his O
sky-blue O
cravat, O
into O
which O
were O
thrust O
two O
diamond O
pins, O
held O
together O
by O
a O
small O
gold O
chain; O
and O
he O
smiled O
a O
singular O
smile, O
in O
a O
sugary, O
ambiguous O
fashion. O
But O
noticing O
that O
her O
feet O
were O
damp, O
he O
said-- O
"Do O
get O
closer O
to O
the O
stove; O
put O
your O
feet O
up O
against O
the O
porcelain." O
She O
was O
afraid O
of O
dirtying O
it. O
The O
notary O
replied O
in O
a O
gallant O
tone-- O
"Beautiful O
things O
spoil O
nothing." O
Then O
she O
tried O
to O
move O
him, O
and, O
growing O
moved O
herself, O
she O
began O
telling O
him O
about O
the O
poorness O
of O
her O
home, O
her O
worries, O
her O
wants. O
He O
could O
understand O
that; O
an O
elegant O
woman! O
and, O
without O
leaving O
off O
eating, O
he O
had O
turned O
completely O
round O
towards O
her, O
so O
that O
his O
knee O
brushed O
against O
her O
boot, O
whose O
sole O
curled O
round O
as O
it O
smoked O
against O
the O
stove. O
But O
when O
she O
asked O
for O
a O
thousand O
sous, O
he O
closed O
his O
lips, O
and O
declared O
he O
was O
very O
sorry O
he O
had O
not O
had O
the O
management O
of O
her O
fortune O
before, O
for O
there O
were O
hundreds O
of O
ways O
very O
convenient, O
even O
for O
a O
lady, O
of O
turning O
her O
money O
to O
account. O
They O
might, O
either O
in O
the O
turf-peats O
of O
Grumesnil O
or O
building-ground O
at O
Havre, O
almost O
without O
risk, O
have O
ventured O
on O
some O
excellent O
speculations; O
and O
he O
let O
her O
consume O
herself O
with O
rage O
at O
the O
thought O
of O
the O
fabulous O
sums O
that O
she O
would O
certainly O
have O
made. O
"How O
was O
it," O
he O
went O
on, O
"that O
you O
didn't O
come O
to O
me?" O
"I O
hardly O
know," O
she O
said. O
"Why, O
hey? O
Did O
I O
frighten O
you O
so O
much? O
It O
is O
I, O
on O
the O
contrary, O
who O
ought O
to O
complain. O
We O
hardly O
know O
one O
another; O
yet O
I O
am O
very O
devoted O
to O
you. O
You O
do O
not O
doubt O
that, O
I O
hope?" O
He O
held O
out O
his O
hand, O
took O
hers, O
covered O
it O
with O
a O
greedy O
kiss, O
then O
held O
it O
on O
his O
knee; O
and O
he O
played O
delicately O
with O
her O
fingers O
whilst O
he O
murmured O
a O
thousand O
blandishments. O
His O
insipid O
voice O
murmured O
like O
a O
running O
brook; O
a O
light O
shone O
in O
his O
eyes O
through O
the O
glimmering O
of O
his O
spectacles, O
and O
his O
hand O
was O
advancing O
up O
Emma's O
sleeve O
to O
press O
her O
arm. O
She O
felt O
against O
her O
cheek O
his O
panting O
breath. O
This O
man O
oppressed O
her O
horribly. O
SHE O
SPRANG O
UP O
AND O
SAID O
TO O
HIM-- O
"Sir, O
I O
am O
waiting." O
"For O
what?" O
said O
the O
notary, O
who O
suddenly O
became O
very O
pale. O
"This O
money." O
"But O
-- O
" O
Then, O
yielding O
to O
the O
outburst O
of O
too O
powerful O
a O
desire, O
"Well, O
yes!" O
He O
dragged O
himself O
towards O
her O
on O
his O
knees, O
regardless O
of O
his O
dressing-gown. O
"For O
pity's O
sake, O
stay. O
I O
love O
you!" O
He O
seized O
her O
by O
her O
waist. O
Madame O
Bovary's O
face O
flushed O
purple. O
She O
recoiled O
with O
a O
terrible O
look, O
crying-- O
"You O
are O
taking O
a O
shameless O
advantage O
of O
my O
distress, O
sir! O
I O
am O
to O
be O
pitied-- O
not O
to O
be O
sold." O
And O
she O
went O
out. O
The O
notary O
remained O
quite O
stupefied, O
his O
eyes O
fixed O
on O
his O
fine O
embroidered O
slippers. O
They O
were O
a O
love O
gift, O
and O
the O
sight O
of O
them O
at O
last O
consoled O
him. O
Besides, O
he O
reflected O
that O
such O
an O
adventure O
might O
have O
carried O
him O
too O
far. O
"What O
a O
wretch! O
what O
a O
scoundrel! O
what O
an O
infamy!" O
she O
said O
to O
herself, O
as O
she O
fled O
with O
nervous O
steps O
beneath O
the O
aspens O
of O
the O
path. O
The O
disappointment O
of O
her O
failure O
increased O
the O
indignation O
of O
her O
outraged O
modesty; O
it O
seemed O
to O
her O
that O
Providence O
pursued O
her O
implacably, O
and, O
strengthening O
herself O
in O
her O
pride, O
she O
had O
never O
felt O
so O
much O
esteem O
for O
herself O
nor O
so O
much O
contempt O
for O
others. O
A O
spirit O
of O
warfare O
transformed O
her. O
She O
would O
have O
liked O
to O
strike O
all O
men, O
to O
spit O
in O
their O
faces, O
to O
crush O
them, O
and O
she O
walked O
rapidly O
straight O
on, O
pale, O
quivering, O
maddened, O
searching O
the O
empty O
horizon O
with O
tear-dimmed O
eyes, O
and O
as O
it O
were O
rejoicing O
in O
the O
hate O
that O
was O
choking O
her. O
When O
she O
saw O
her O
house O
a O
numbness O
came O
over O
her. O
She O
could O
not O
go O
on; O
and O
yet O
she O
must. O
Besides, O
whither O
could O
she O
flee? O
Felicite O
was O
waiting O
for O
her O
at O
the O
door. O
"Well?" O
"No!" O
said O
Emma. O
And O
for O
a O
quarter O
of O
an O
hour O
the O
two O
of O
them O
went O
over O
the O
various O
persons O
in O
Yonville O
who O
might O
perhaps O
be O
inclined O
to O
help O
her. O
But O
each O
time O
that O
Felicite O
named O
someone O
Emma O
replied-- O
"Impossible! O
they O
will O
not!" O
"And O
the O
master'll O
soon O
be O
in." O
"I O
know O
that O
well O
enough. O
Leave O
me O
alone." O
She O
had O
tried O
everything; O
there O
was O
nothing O
more O
to O
be O
done O
now; O
and O
when O
Charles O
came O
in O
she O
would O
have O
to O
say O
to O
him-- O
"Go O
away! O
This O
carpet O
on O
which O
you O
are O
walking O
is O
no O
longer O
ours. O
In O
your O
own O
house O
you O
do O
not O
possess O
a O
chair, O
a O
pin, O
a O
straw, O
and O
it O
is O
I, O
poor O
man, O
who O
have O
ruined O
you." O
Then O
there O
would O
be O
a O
great O
sob; O
next O
he O
would O
weep O
abundantly, O
and O
at O
last, O
the O
surprise O
past, O
he O
would O
forgive O
her. O
"Yes," O
she O
murmured, O
grinding O
her O
teeth, O
"he O
will O
forgive O
me, O
he O
who O
would O
give O
a O
million O
if O
I O
would O
forgive O
him O
for O
having O
known O
me! O
Never! O
never!" O
This O
thought O
of O
Bovary's O
superiority O
to O
her O
exasperated O
her. O
Then, O
whether O
she O
confessed O
or O
did O
not O
confess, O
presently, O
immediately, O
to-morrow, O
he O
would O
know O
the O
catastrophe O
all O
the O
same; O
so O
she O
must O
wait O
for O
this O
horrible O
scene, O
and O
bear O
the O
weight O
of O
his O
magnanimity. O
The O
desire O
to O
return O
to O
Lheureux's O
seized O
her-- O
what O
would O
be O
the O
use? O
To O
write O
to O
her O
father-- O
it O
was O
too O
late; O
and O
perhaps, O
she O
began O
to O
repent O
now O
that O
she O
had O
not O
yielded O
to O
that O
other, O
when O
she O
heard O
the O
trot O
of O
a O
horse O
in O
the O
alley. O
It O
was O
he; O
he O
was O
opening O
the O
gate; O
he O
was O
whiter O
than O
the O
plaster O
wall. O
Rushing O
to O
the O
stairs, O
she O
ran O
out O
quickly O
to O
the O
square; O
and O
the O
wife O
of O
the O
mayor, O
who O
was O
talking O
to O
Lestiboudois O
in O
front O
of O
the O
church, O
saw O
her O
go O
in O
to O
the O
tax-collector's. O
She O
hurried O
off O
to O
tell O
Madame O
Caron, O
and O
the O
two O
ladies O
went O
up O
to O
the O
attic, O
and, O
hidden O
by O
some O
linen O
spread O
across O
props, O
stationed O
themselves O
comfortably O
for O
overlooking O
the O
whole O
of O
Binet's O
room. O
He O
was O
alone O
in O
his O
garret, O
busy O
imitating O
in O
wood O
one O
of O
those O
indescribable O
bits O
of O
ivory, O
composed O
of O
crescents, O
of O
spheres O
hollowed O
out O
one O
within O
the O
other, O
the O
whole O
as O
straight O
as O
an O
obelisk, O
and O
of O
no O
use O
whatever; O
and O
he O
was O
beginning O
on O
the O
last O
piece-- O
he O
was O
nearing O
his O
goal. O
In O
the O
twilight O
of O
the O
workshop O
the O
white O
dust O
was O
flying O
from O
his O
tools O
like O
a O
shower O
of O
sparks O
under O
the O
hoofs O
of O
a O
galloping O
horse; O
the O
two O
wheels O
were O
turning, O
droning; O
Binet O
smiled, O
his O
chin O
lowered, O
his O
nostrils O
distended, O
and, O
in O
a O
word, O
seemed O
lost O
in O
one O
of O
those O
complete O
happinesses O
that, O
no O
doubt, O
belong O
only O
to O
commonplace O
occupations, O
which O
amuse O
the O
mind O
with O
facile O
difficulties, O
and O
satisfy O
by O
a O
realisation O
of O
that O
beyond O
which O
such O
minds O
have O
not O
a O
dream. O
"Ah! O
there O
she O
is!" O
exclaimed O
Madame O
Tuvache. O
But O
it O
was O
impossible O
because O
of O
the O
lathe O
to O
hear O
what O
she O
was O
saying. O
At O
last O
these O
ladies O
thought O
they O
made O
out O
the O
word O
"francs," O
and O
Madame O
TUVACHE O
WHISPERED O
IN O
A O
LOW O
VOICE-- O
"She O
is O
begging O
him O
to O
give O
her O
time O
for O
paying O
her O
taxes." O
"Apparently!" O
replied O
the O
other. O
They O
saw O
her O
walking O
up O
and O
down, O
examining O
the O
napkin-rings, O
the O
candlesticks, O
the O
banister O
rails O
against O
the O
walls, O
while O
Binet O
stroked O
his O
beard O
with O
satisfaction. O
"Do O
you O
think O
she O
wants O
to O
order O
something O
of O
him?" O
said O
Madame O
Tuvache. O
"Why, O
he O
doesn't O
sell O
anything," O
objected O
her O
neighbour. O
The O
tax-collector O
seemed O
to O
be O
listening O
with O
wide-open O
eyes, O
as O
if O
he O
did O
not O
understand. O
She O
went O
on O
in O
a O
tender, O
suppliant O
manner. O
She O
came O
nearer O
to O
him, O
her O
breast O
heaving; O
they O
no O
longer O
spoke. O
"Is O
she O
making O
him O
advances?" O
said O
Madame O
Tuvache. O
Binet O
was O
scarlet O
to O
his O
very O
ears. O
She O
took O
hold O
of O
his O
hands. O
"Oh, O
it's O
too O
much!" O
And O
no O
doubt O
she O
was O
suggesting O
something O
abominable O
to O
him; O
for O
the O
tax-collector-- O
yet O
he O
was O
brave, O
had O
fought O
at O
Bautzen O
and O
at O
Lutzen, O
had O
been O
through O
the O
French O
campaign, O
and O
had O
even O
been O
recommended O
for O
the O
cross-- O
suddenly, O
as O
at O
the O
sight O
of O
a O
serpent, O
recoiled O
as O
far O
as O
he O
could O
from O
her, O
crying-- O
"Madame! O
what O
do O
you O
mean?" O
"Women O
like O
that O
ought O
to O
be O
whipped," O
said O
Madame O
Tuvache. O
"But O
where O
is O
she?" O
continued O
Madame O
Caron, O
for O
she O
had O
disappeared O
whilst O
they O
spoke; O
then O
catching O
sight O
of O
her O
going O
up O
the O
Grande O
Rue, O
and O
turning O
to O
the O
right O
as O
if O
making O
for O
the O
cemetery, O
they O
were O
lost O
in O
conjectures. O
"Nurse O
Rollet," O
she O
said O
on O
reaching O
the O
nurse's, O
"I O
am O
choking; O
unlace O
me!" O
She O
fell O
on O
the O
bed O
sobbing. O
Nurse O
Rollet O
covered O
her O
with O
a O
petticoat O
and O
remained O
standing O
by O
her O
side. O
Then, O
as O
she O
did O
not O
answer, O
the O
good O
woman O
withdrew, O
took O
her O
wheel O
and O
began O
spinning O
flax. O
"Oh, O
leave O
off!" O
she O
murmured, O
fancying O
she O
heard O
Binet's O
lathe. O
"What's O
bothering O
her?" O
said O
the O
nurse O
to O
herself. O
"Why O
has O
she O
come O
here?" O
She O
had O
rushed O
thither; O
impelled O
by O
a O
kind O
of O
horror O
that O
drove O
her O
from O
her O
home. O
Lying O
on O
her O
back, O
motionless, O
and O
with O
staring O
eyes, O
she O
saw O
things O
but O
vaguely, O
although O
she O
tried O
to O
with O
idiotic O
persistence. O
She O
looked O
at O
the O
scales O
on O
the O
walls, O
two O
brands O
smoking O
end O
to O
end, O
and O
a O
long O
spider O
crawling O
over O
her O
head O
in O
a O
rent O
in O
the O
beam. O
At O
last O
she O
began O
to O
collect O
her O
thoughts. O
She O
remembered-- O
one O
day-- O
Leon-- O
Oh! O
how O
long O
ago O
that O
was-- O
the O
sun O
was O
shining O
on O
the O
river, O
and O
the O
clematis O
were O
perfuming O
the O
air. O
Then, O
carried O
away O
as O
by O
a O
rushing O
torrent, O
she O
soon O
began O
to O
recall O
the O
day O
before. O
"What O
time O
is O
it?" O
she O
asked. O
Mere O
Rollet O
went O
out, O
raised O
the O
fingers O
of O
her O
right O
hand O
to O
that O
side O
of O
the O
sky O
that O
was O
brightest, O
and O
came O
back O
slowly, O
saying-- O
"Nearly O
three." O
"Ahl O
thanks, O
thanks!" O
For O
he O
would O
come; O
he O
would O
have O
found O
some O
money. O
But O
he O
would, O
perhaps, O
go O
down O
yonder, O
not O
guessing O
she O
was O
here, O
and O
she O
told O
the O
nurse O
to O
run O
to O
her O
house O
to O
fetch O
him. O
"Be O
quick!" O
"But, O
my O
dear O
lady, O
I'm O
going, O
I'm O
going!" O
She O
wondered O
now O
that O
she O
had O
not O
thought O
of O
him O
from O
the O
first. O
Yesterday O
he O
had O
given O
his O
word; O
he O
would O
not O
break O
it. O
And O
she O
already O
saw O
herself O
at O
Lheureux's O
spreading O
out O
her O
three O
bank-notes O
on O
his O
bureau. O
Then O
she O
would O
have O
to O
invent O
some O
story O
to O
explain O
matters O
to O
Bovary. O
What O
should O
it O
be? O
The O
nurse, O
however, O
was O
a O
long O
while O
gone. O
But, O
as O
there O
was O
no O
clock O
in O
the O
cot, O
Emma O
feared O
she O
was O
perhaps O
exaggerating O
the O
length O
of O
time. O
She O
began O
walking O
round O
the O
garden, O
step O
by O
step; O
she O
went O
into O
the O
path O
by O
the O
hedge, O
and O
returned O
quickly, O
hoping O
that O
the O
woman O
would O
have O
come O
back O
by O
another O
road. O
At O
last, O
weary O
of O
waiting, O
assailed O
by O
fears O
that O
she O
thrust O
from O
her, O
no O
longer O
conscious O
whether O
she O
had O
been O
here O
a O
century O
or O
a O
moment, O
she O
sat O
down O
in O
a O
corner, O
closed O
her O
eyes, O
and O
stopped O
her O
ears. O
The O
gate O
grated; O
she O
sprang O
up. O
Before O
she O
had O
spoken O
MERE O
ROLLET O
SAID O
TO O
HER-- O
"There O
is O
no O
one O
at O
your O
house!" O
"What?" O
"Oh, O
no O
one! O
And O
the O
doctor O
is O
crying. O
He O
is O
calling O
for O
you; O
they're O
looking O
for O
you." O
Emma O
answered O
nothing. O
She O
gasped O
as O
she O
turned O
her O
eyes O
about O
her, O
while O
the O
peasant O
woman, O
frightened O
at O
her O
face, O
drew O
back O
instinctively, O
thinking O
her O
mad. O
Suddenly O
she O
struck O
her O
brow O
and O
uttered O
a O
cry; O
for O
the O
thought O
of O
Rodolphe, O
like O
a O
flash O
of O
lightning O
in O
a O
dark O
night, O
had O
passed O
into O
her O
soul. O
He O
was O
so O
good, O
so O
delicate, O
so O
generous! O
And O
besides, O
should O
he O
hesitate O
to O
do O
her O
this O
service, O
she O
would O
know O
well O
enough O
how O
to O
constrain O
him O
to O
it O
by O
re-waking, O
in O
a O
single O
moment, O
their O
lost O
love. O
So O
she O
set O
out O
towards O
La O
Huchette, O
not O
seeing O
that O
she O
was O
hastening O
to O
offer O
herself O
to O
that O
which O
but O
a O
while O
ago O
had O
so O
angered O
her, O
not O
in O
the O
least O
conscious O
of O
her O
prostitution. O
CHAPTER O
EIGHT O
She O
asked O
herself O
as O
she O
walked O
along, O
"What O
am O
I O
going O
to O
say? O
How O
shall O
I O
begin?" O
And O
as O
she O
went O
on O
she O
recognised O
the O
thickets, O
the O
trees, O
the O
sea-rushes O
on O
the O
hill, O
the O
chateau O
yonder. O
All O
the O
sensations O
of O
her O
first O
tenderness O
came O
back O
to O
her, O
and O
her O
poor O
aching O
heart O
opened O
out O
amorously. O
A O
warm O
wind O
blew O
in O
her O
face; O
the O
melting O
snow O
fell O
drop O
by O
drop O
from O
the O
buds O
to O
the O
grass. O
She O
entered, O
as O
she O
used O
to, O
through O
the O
small O
park-gate. O
She O
reached O
the O
avenue O
bordered O
by O
a O
double O
row O
of O
dense O
lime-trees. O
They O
were O
swaying O
their O
long O
whispering O
branches O
to O
and O
fro. O
The O
dogs O
in O
their O
kennels O
all O
barked, O
and O
the O
noise O
of O
their O
voices O
resounded, O
but O
brought O
out O
no O
one. O
She O
went O
up O
the O
large O
straight O
staircase O
with O
wooden O
balusters O
that O
led O
to O
the O
corridor O
paved O
with O
dusty O
flags, O
into O
which O
several O
doors O
in O
a O
row O
opened, O
as O
in O
a O
monastery O
or O
an O
inn. O
His O
was O
at O
the O
top, O
right O
at O
the O
end, O
on O
the O
left. O
When O
she O
placed O
her O
fingers O
on O
the O
lock O
her O
strength O
suddenly O
deserted O
her. O
She O
was O
afraid, O
almost O
wished O
he O
would O
not O
be O
there, O
though O
this O
was O
her O
only O
hope, O
her O
last O
chance O
of O
salvation. O
She O
collected O
her O
thoughts O
for O
one O
moment, O
and, O
strengthening O
herself O
by O
the O
feeling O
of O
present O
necessity, O
went O
in. O
He O
was O
in O
front O
of O
the O
fire, O
both O
his O
feet O
on O
the O
mantelpiece, O
smoking O
a O
pipe. O
"What! O
it O
is O
you!" O
he O
said, O
getting O
up O
hurriedly. O
"Yes, O
it O
is O
I, O
Rodolphe. O
I O
should O
like O
to O
ask O
your O
advice." O
And, O
despite O
all O
her O
efforts, O
it O
was O
impossible O
for O
her O
to O
open O
her O
lips. O
"You O
have O
not O
changed; O
you O
are O
charming O
as O
ever!" O
"Oh," O
she O
replied O
bitterly, O
"they O
are O
poor O
charms O
since O
you O
disdained O
them." O
Then O
he O
began O
a O
long O
explanation O
of O
his O
conduct, O
excusing O
himself O
in O
vague O
terms, O
in O
default O
of O
being O
able O
to O
invent O
better. O
She O
yielded O
to O
his O
words, O
still O
more O
to O
his O
voice O
and O
the O
sight O
of O
him, O
so O
that, O
she O
pretended O
to O
believe, O
or O
perhaps O
believed; O
in O
the O
pretext O
he O
gave O
for O
their O
rupture; O
this O
was O
a O
secret O
on O
which O
depended O
the O
honour, O
the O
very O
life O
of O
a O
third O
person. O
"No O
matter!" O
she O
said, O
looking O
at O
him O
sadly. O
"I O
have O
suffered O
much." O
HE O
REPLIED O
PHILOSOPHICALLY-- O
"Such O
is O
life!" O
"Has O
life," O
Emma O
went O
on, O
"been O
good O
to O
you O
at O
least, O
since O
our O
separation?" O
"Oh, O
neither O
good O
nor O
bad." O
"Perhaps O
it O
would O
have O
been O
better O
never O
to O
have O
parted." O
"Yes, O
perhaps." O
"You O
think O
so?" O
she O
said, O
drawing O
nearer, O
and O
she O
sighed. O
"Oh, O
Rodolphe! O
if O
you O
but O
knew! O
I O
loved O
you O
so!" O
It O
was O
then O
that O
she O
took O
his O
hand, O
and O
they O
remained O
some O
time, O
their O
fingers O
intertwined, O
like O
that O
first O
day O
at O
the O
Show. O
With O
a O
gesture O
of O
pride O
he O
struggled O
against O
this O
emotion. O
But O
sinking O
upon O
his O
breast O
she O
said O
to O
him-- O
"How O
did O
you O
think O
I O
could O
live O
without O
you? O
One O
cannot O
lose O
the O
habit O
of O
happiness. O
I O
was O
desolate. O
I O
thought O
I O
should O
die. O
I O
will O
tell O
you O
about O
all O
that O
and O
you O
will O
see. O
And O
you-- O
you O
fled O
from O
me!" O
For, O
all O
the O
three O
years, O
he O
had O
carefully O
avoided O
her O
in O
consequence O
of O
that O
natural O
cowardice O
that O
characterises O
the O
stronger O
sex. O
Emma O
went O
on, O
with O
dainty O
little O
nods, O
more O
coaxing O
than O
an O
amorous O
kitten-- O
"You O
love O
others, O
confess O
it! O
Oh, O
I O
understand O
them, O
dear! O
I O
excuse O
them. O
You O
probably O
seduced O
them O
as O
you O
seduced O
me. O
You O
are O
indeed O
a O
man; O
you O
have O
everything O
to O
make O
one O
love O
you. O
But O
we'll O
begin O
again, O
won't O
we? O
We O
will O
love O
one O
another. O
See! O
I O
am O
laughing; O
I O
am O
happy! O
Oh, O
speak!" O
And O
she O
was O
charming O
to O
see, O
with O
her O
eyes, O
in O
which O
trembled O
a O
tear, O
like O
the O
rain O
of O
a O
storm O
in O
a O
blue O
corolla. O
He O
had O
drawn O
her O
upon O
his O
knees, O
and O
with O
the O
back O
of O
his O
hand O
was O
caressing O
her O
smooth O
hair, O
where O
in O
the O
twilight O
was O
mirrored O
like O
a O
golden O
arrow O
one O
last O
ray O
of O
the O
sun. O
She O
bent O
down O
her O
brow; O
at O
last O
he O
kissed O
her O
on O
the O
eyelids O
quite O
gently O
with O
the O
tips O
of O
his O
lips. O
"Why, O
you O
have O
been O
crying! O
What O
for?" O
She O
burst O
into O
tears. O
Rodolphe O
thought O
this O
was O
an O
outburst O
of O
her O
love. O
As O
she O
did O
not O
speak, O
he O
took O
this O
silence O
for O
a O
last O
remnant O
of O
resistance, O
and O
then O
he O
cried O
out-- O
"Oh, O
forgive O
me! O
You O
are O
the O
only O
one O
who O
pleases O
me. O
I O
was O
imbecile O
and O
cruel. O
I O
love O
you. O
I O
will O
love O
you O
always. O
What O
is O
it. O
Tell O
me!" O
He O
was O
kneeling O
by O
her. O
"Well, O
I O
am O
ruined, O
Rodolphe! O
You O
must O
lend O
me O
three O
thousand O
francs." O
"But-- O
but O
-- O
" O
said O
he, O
getting O
up O
slowly, O
while O
his O
face O
assumed O
a O
grave O
expression. O
"You O
know," O
she O
went O
on O
quickly, O
"that O
my O
husband O
had O
placed O
his O
whole O
fortune O
at O
a O
notary's. O
He O
ran O
away. O
So O
we O
borrowed; O
the O
patients O
don't O
pay O
us. O
Moreover, O
the O
settling O
of O
the O
estate O
is O
not O
yet O
done; O
we O
shall O
have O
the O
money O
later O
on. O
But O
to-day, O
for O
want O
of O
three O
thousand O
francs, O
we O
are O
to O
be O
sold O
up. O
It O
is O
to O
be O
at O
once, O
this O
very O
moment, O
and, O
counting O
upon O
your O
friendship, O
I O
have O
come O
to O
you." O
"Ah!" O
thought O
Rodolphe, O
turning O
very O
pale, O
"that O
was O
what O
she O
came O
for." O
AT O
LAST O
HE O
SAID O
WITH O
A O
CALM O
AIR-- O
"Dear O
madame, O
I O
have O
not O
got O
them." O
He O
did O
not O
lie. O
If O
he O
had O
had O
them, O
he O
would, O
no O
doubt, O
have O
given O
them, O
although O
it O
is O
generally O
disagreeable O
to O
do O
such O
fine O
things: O
a O
demand O
for O
money O
being, O
of O
all O
the O
winds O
that O
blow O
upon O
love, O
the O
coldest O
and O
most O
destructive. O
First O
she O
looked O
at O
him O
for O
some O
moments. O
"You O
have O
not O
got O
them!" O
she O
repeated O
several O
times. O
"You O
have O
not O
got O
them! O
I O
ought O
to O
have O
spared O
myself O
this O
last O
shame. O
You O
never O
loved O
me. O
You O
are O
no O
better O
than O
the O
others." O
She O
was O
betraying, O
ruining O
herself. O
Rodolphe O
interrupted O
her, O
declaring O
he O
was O
"hard O
up" O
himself. O
"Ah! O
I O
pity O
you," O
said O
Emma. O
"Yes-- O
very O
much." O
And O
fixing O
her O
eyes O
upon O
an O
embossed O
carabine, O
that O
shone O
against O
its O
panoply, O
"But O
when O
one O
is O
so O
poor O
one O
doesn't O
have O
silver O
on O
the O
butt O
of O
one's O
gun. O
One O
doesn't O
buy O
a O
clock O
inlaid O
with O
tortoise O
shell," O
she O
went O
on, O
pointing O
to O
a O
buhl O
timepiece, O
"nor O
silver-gilt O
whistles O
for O
one's O
whips," O
and O
she O
touched O
them, O
"nor O
charms O
for O
one's O
watch. O
Oh, O
he O
wants O
for O
nothing! O
even O
to O
a O
liqueur-stand O
in O
his O
room! O
For O
you O
love O
yourself; O
you O
live O
well. O
You O
have O
a O
chateau, O
farms, O
woods; O
you O
go O
hunting; O
you O
travel O
to O
Paris. O
Why, O
if O
it O
were O
but O
that," O
she O
cried, O
taking O
up O
two O
studs O
from O
the O
mantelpiece, O
"but O
the O
least O
of O
these O
trifles, O
one O
can O
get O
money O
for O
them. O
Oh, O
I O
do O
not O
want O
them, O
keep O
them!" O
And O
she O
threw O
the O
two O
links O
away O
from O
her, O
their O
gold O
chain O
breaking O
as O
it O
struck O
against O
the O
wall. O
"But O
I! O
I O
would O
have O
given O
you O
everything. O
I O
would O
have O
sold O
all, O
worked O
for O
you O
with O
my O
hands, O
I O
would O
have O
begged O
on O
the O
highroads O
for O
a O
smile, O
for O
a O
look, O
to O
hear O
you O
say O
'Thanks!' O
And O
you O
sit O
there O
quietly O
in O
your O
arm-chair, O
as O
if O
you O
had O
not O
made O
me O
suffer O
enough O
already! O
But O
for O
you, O
and O
you O
know O
it, O
I O
might O
have O
lived O
happily. O
What O
made O
you O
do O
it? O
Was O
it O
a O
bet? O
Yet O
you O
loved O
me-- O
you O
said O
so. O
And O
but O
a O
moment O
since-- O
Ah! O
it O
would O
have O
been O
better O
to O
have O
driven O
me O
away. O
My O
hands O
are O
hot O
with O
your O
kisses, O
and O
there O
is O
the O
spot O
on O
the O
carpet O
where O
at O
my O
knees O
you O
swore O
an O
eternity O
of O
love! O
You O
made O
me O
believe O
you; O
for O
two O
years O
you O
held O
me O
in O
the O
most O
magnificent, O
the O
sweetest O
dream! O
Eh! O
Our O
plans O
for O
the O
journey, O
do O
you O
remember? O
Oh, O
your O
letter! O
your O
letter! O
it O
tore O
my O
heart! O
And O
then O
when O
I O
come O
back O
to O
him-- O
to O
him, O
rich, O
happy, O
free-- O
to O
implore O
the O
help O
the O
first O
stranger O
would O
give, O
a O
suppliant, O
and O
bringing O
back O
to O
him O
all O
my O
tenderness, O
he O
repulses O
me O
because O
it O
would O
cost O
him O
three O
thousand O
francs!" O
"I O
haven't O
got O
them," O
replied O
Rodolphe, O
with O
that O
perfect O
calm O
with O
which O
resigned O
rage O
covers O
itself O
as O
with O
a O
shield. O
She O
went O
out. O
The O
walls O
trembled, O
the O
ceiling O
was O
crushing O
her, O
and O
she O
passed O
back O
through O
the O
long O
alley, O
stumbling O
against O
the O
heaps O
of O
dead O
leaves O
scattered O
by O
the O
wind. O
At O
last O
she O
reached O
the O
ha-ha O
hedge O
in O
front O
of O
the O
gate; O
she O
broke O
her O
nails O
against O
the O
lock O
in O
her O
haste O
to O
open O
it. O
Then O
a O
hundred O
steps O
farther O
on, O
breathless, O
almost O
falling, O
she O
stopped. O
And O
now O
turning O
round, O
she O
once O
more O
saw O
the O
impassive O
chateau, O
with O
the O
park, O
the O
gardens, O
the O
three O
courts, O
and O
all O
the O
windows O
of O
the O
facade. O
She O
remained O
lost O
in O
stupor, O
and O
having O
no O
more O
consciousness O
of O
herself O
than O
through O
the O
beating O
of O
her O
arteries, O
that O
she O
seemed O
to O
hear O
bursting O
forth O
like O
a O
deafening O
music O
filling O
all O
the O
fields. O
The O
earth O
beneath O
her O
feet O
was O
more O
yielding O
than O
the O
sea, O
and O
the O
furrows O
seemed O
to O
her O
immense O
brown O
waves O
breaking O
into O
foam. O
Everything O
in O
her O
head, O
of O
memories, O
ideas, O
went O
off O
at O
once O
like O
a O
thousand O
pieces O
of O
fireworks. O
She O
saw O
her O
father, O
Lheureux's O
closet, O
their O
room O
at O
home, O
another O
landscape. O
Madness O
was O
coming O
upon O
her; O
she O
grew O
afraid, O
and O
managed O
to O
recover O
herself, O
in O
a O
confused O
way, O
it O
is O
true, O
for O
she O
did O
not O
in O
the O
least O
remember O
the O
cause O
of O
the O
terrible O
condition O
she O
was O
in, O
that O
is O
to O
say, O
the O
question O
of O
money. O
She O
suffered O
only O
in O
her O
love, O
and O
felt O
her O
soul O
passing O
from O
her O
in O
this O
memory; O
as O
wounded O
men, O
dying, O
feel O
their O
life O
ebb O
from O
their O
bleeding O
wounds. O
Night O
was O
falling, O
crows O
were O
flying O
about. O
Suddenly O
it O
seemed O
to O
her O
that O
fiery O
spheres O
were O
exploding O
in O
the O
air O
like O
fulminating O
balls O
when O
they O
strike, O
and O
were O
whirling, O
whirling, O
to O
melt O
at O
last O
upon O
the O
snow O
between O
the O
branches O
of O
the O
trees. O
In O
the O
midst O
of O
each O
of O
them O
appeared O
the O
face O
of O
Rodolphe. O
They O
multiplied O
and O
drew O
near O
her, O
penetrating, O
her. O
It O
all O
disappeared; O
she O
recognised O
the O
lights O
of O
the O
houses O
that O
shone O
through O
the O
fog. O
Now O
her O
situation, O
like O
an O
abyss, O
rose O
up O
before O
her. O
She O
was O
panting O
as O
if O
her O
heart O
would O
burst. O
Then O
in O
an O
ecstasy O
of O
heroism, O
that O
made O
her O
almost O
joyous, O
she O
ran O
down O
the O
hill, O
crossed O
the O
cow-plank, O
the O
foot-path, O
the O
alley, O
the O
market, O
and O
reached O
the O
chemist's O
shop. O
She O
was O
about O
to O
enter, O
but O
at O
the O
sound O
of O
the O
bell O
someone O
might O
come, O
and O
slipping O
in O
by O
the O
gate, O
holding O
her O
breath, O
feeling O
her O
way O
along O
the O
walls, O
she O
went O
as O
far O
as O
the O
door O
of O
the O
kitchen, O
where O
a O
candle O
stuck O
on O
the O
stove O
was O
burning. O
Justin O
in O
his O
shirt-sleeves O
was O
carrying O
out O
a O
dish. O
"Ah! O
they O
are O
dining; O
I O
will O
wait." O
He O
returned; O
she O
tapped O
at O
the O
window. O
He O
went O
out. O
"The O
key! O
the O
one O
for O
upstairs O
where O
he O
keeps O
the O
-- O
" O
"What?" O
And O
he O
looked O
at O
her, O
astonished O
at O
the O
pallor O
of O
her O
face, O
that O
stood O
out O
white O
against O
the O
black O
background O
of O
the O
night. O
She O
seemed O
to O
him O
extraordinarily O
beautiful O
and O
majestic O
as O
a O
phantom. O
Without O
understanding O
what O
she O
wanted, O
he O
had O
the O
presentiment O
of O
something O
terrible. O
But O
she O
went O
on O
quickly O
in O
a O
love O
voice; O
in O
a O
sweet, O
melting O
voice, O
"I O
want O
it; O
give O
it O
to O
me." O
As O
the O
partition O
wall O
was O
thin, O
they O
could O
hear O
the O
clatter O
of O
the O
forks O
on O
the O
plates O
in O
the O
dining-room. O
She O
pretended O
that O
she O
wanted O
to O
kill O
the O
rats O
that O
kept O
her O
from O
sleeping. O
"I O
must O
tell O
master." O
"No, O
stay!" O
Then O
with O
an O
indifferent O
air, O
"Oh, O
it's O
not O
worth O
while; O
I'll O
tell O
him O
presently. O
Come, O
light O
me O
upstairs." O
She O
entered O
the O
corridor O
into O
which O
the O
laboratory O
door O
opened. O
Against O
the O
wall O
was O
a O
key O
labelled O
Capharnaum. O
"Justin!" O
called O
the O
druggist O
impatiently. O
"Let O
us O
go O
up." O
And O
he O
followed O
her. O
The O
key O
turned O
in O
the O
lock, O
and O
she O
went O
straight O
to O
the O
third O
shelf, O
so O
well O
did O
her O
memory O
guide O
her, O
seized O
the O
blue O
jar, O
tore O
out O
the O
cork, O
plunged O
in O
her O
hand, O
and O
withdrawing O
it O
full O
of O
a O
white O
powder, O
she O
began O
eating O
it. O
"Stop!" O
he O
cried, O
rushing O
at O
her. O
"Hush! O
someone O
will O
come." O
He O
was O
in O
despair, O
was O
calling O
out. O
"Say O
nothing, O
or O
all O
the O
blame O
will O
fall O
on O
your O
master." O
Then O
she O
went O
home, O
suddenly O
calmed, O
and O
with O
something O
of O
the O
serenity O
of O
one O
that O
had O
performed O
a O
duty. O
When O
Charles, O
distracted O
by O
the O
news O
of O
the O
distraint, O
returned O
home, O
Emma O
had O
just O
gone O
out. O
He O
cried O
aloud, O
wept, O
fainted, O
but O
she O
did O
not O
return. O
Where O
could O
she O
be? O
He O
sent O
Felicite O
to O
Homais, O
to O
Monsieur O
Tuvache, O
to O
Lheureux, O
to O
the O
"Lion O
d'Or," O
everywhere, O
and O
in O
the O
intervals O
of O
his O
agony O
he O
saw O
his O
reputation O
destroyed, O
their O
fortune O
lost, O
Berthe's O
future O
ruined. O
By O
what?-- O
Not O
a O
word! O
He O
waited O
till O
six O
in O
the O
evening. O
At O
last, O
unable O
to O
bear O
it O
any O
longer, O
and O
fancying O
she O
had O
gone O
to O
Rouen, O
he O
set O
out O
along O
the O
highroad, O
walked O
a O
mile, O
met O
no O
one, O
again O
waited, O
and O
returned O
home. O
She O
had O
come O
back. O
"What O
was O
the O
matter? O
Why? O
Explain O
to O
me." O
She O
sat O
down O
at O
her O
writing-table O
and O
wrote O
a O
letter, O
which O
she O
sealed O
slowly, O
adding O
the O
date O
and O
the O
hour. O
Then O
she O
said O
in O
a O
solemn O
tone: O
"You O
are O
to O
read O
it O
to-morrow; O
till O
then, O
I O
pray O
you, O
do O
not O
ask O
me O
a O
single O
question. O
No, O
not O
one!" O
"But O
-- O
" O
"Oh, O
leave O
me!" O
She O
lay O
down O
full O
length O
on O
her O
bed. O
A O
bitter O
taste O
that O
she O
felt O
in O
her O
mouth O
awakened O
her. O
She O
saw O
Charles, O
and O
again O
closed O
her O
eyes. O
She O
was O
studying O
herself O
curiously, O
to O
see O
if O
she O
were O
not O
suffering. O
But O
no! O
nothing O
as O
yet. O
She O
heard O
the O
ticking O
of O
the O
clock, O
the O
crackling O
of O
the O
fire, O
and O
Charles O
breathing O
as O
he O
stood O
upright O
by O
her O
bed. O
"Ah! O
it O
is O
but O
a O
little O
thing, O
death!" O
she O
thought. O
"I O
shall O
fall O
asleep O
and O
all O
will O
be O
over." O
She O
drank O
a O
mouthful O
of O
water O
and O
turned O
to O
the O
wall. O
The O
frightful O
taste O
of O
ink O
continued. O
"I O
am O
thirsty; O
oh! O
so O
thirsty," O
she O
sighed. O
"What O
is O
it?" O
said O
Charles, O
who O
was O
handing O
her O
a O
glass. O
"It O
is O
nothing! O
Open O
the O
window; O
I O
am O
choking." O
She O
was O
seized O
with O
a O
sickness O
so O
sudden O
that O
she O
had O
hardly O
time O
to O
draw O
out O
her O
handkerchief O
from O
under O
the O
pillow. O
"Take O
it O
away," O
she O
said O
quickly; O
"throw O
it O
away." O
He O
spoke O
to O
her; O
she O
did O
not O
answer. O
She O
lay O
motionless, O
afraid O
that O
the O
slightest O
movement O
might O
make O
her O
vomit. O
But O
she O
felt O
an O
icy O
cold O
creeping O
from O
her O
feet O
to O
her O
heart. O
"Ah! O
it O
is O
beginning," O
she O
murmured. O
"What O
did O
you O
say?" O
She O
turned O
her O
head O
from O
side O
to O
side O
with O
a O
gentle O
movement O
full O
of O
agony, O
while O
constantly O
opening O
her O
mouth O
as O
if O
something O
very O
heavy O
were O
weighing O
upon O
her O
tongue. O
At O
eight O
o'clock O
the O
vomiting O
began O
again. O
Charles O
noticed O
that O
at O
the O
bottom O
of O
the O
basin O
there O
was O
a O
sort O
of O
white O
sediment O
sticking O
to O
the O
sides O
of O
the O
porcelain. O
"This O
is O
extraordinary-- O
very O
singular," O
he O
repeated. O
But O
she O
said O
in O
a O
firm O
voice, O
"No, O
you O
are O
mistaken." O
Then O
gently, O
and O
almost O
as O
caressing O
her, O
he O
passed O
his O
hand O
over O
her O
stomach. O
She O
uttered O
a O
sharp O
cry. O
He O
fell O
back O
terror-stricken. O
Then O
she O
began O
to O
groan, O
faintly O
at O
first. O
Her O
shoulders O
were O
shaken O
by O
a O
strong O
shuddering, O
and O
she O
was O
growing O
paler O
than O
the O
sheets O
in O
which O
her O
clenched O
fingers O
buried O
themselves. O
Her O
unequal O
pulse O
was O
now O
almost O
imperceptible. O
Drops O
of O
sweat O
oozed O
from O
her O
bluish O
face, O
that O
seemed O
as O
if O
rigid O
in O
the O
exhalations O
of O
a O
metallic O
vapour. O
Her O
teeth O
chattered, O
her O
dilated O
eyes O
looked O
vaguely O
about O
her, O
and O
to O
all O
questions O
she O
replied O
only O
with O
a O
shake O
of O
the O
head; O
she O
even O
smiled O
once O
or O
twice. O
Gradually, O
her O
moaning O
grew O
louder; O
a O
hollow O
shriek O
burst O
from O
her; O
she O
pretended O
she O
was O
better O
and O
that O
she O
would O
get O
up O
presently. O
But O
she O
was O
seized O
with O
convulsions O
and O
cried O
out-- O
"Ah! O
my O
God! O
It O
is O
horrible!" O
He O
threw O
himself O
on O
his O
knees O
by O
her O
bed. O
"Tell O
me! O
what O
have O
you O
eaten? O
Answer, O
for O
heaven's O
sake!" O
And O
he O
looked O
at O
her O
with O
a O
tenderness O
in O
his O
eyes O
such O
as O
she O
had O
never O
seen. O
"Well, O
there-- O
there!" O
she O
said O
in O
a O
faint O
voice. O
He O
flew O
to O
the O
writing-table, O
tore O
open O
the O
seal, O
and O
read O
aloud: O
"Accuse O
no O
one." O
He O
stopped, O
passed O
his O
hands O
across O
his O
eyes, O
and O
read O
it O
over O
again. O
"What! O
help-- O
help!" O
He O
could O
only O
keep O
repeating O
the O
word: O
"Poisoned! O
poisoned!" O
Felicite O
ran O
to O
Homais, O
who O
proclaimed O
it O
in O
the O
market-place; O
Madame O
Lefrancois O
heard O
it O
at O
the O
"Lion O
d'Or"; O
some O
got O
up O
to O
go O
and O
tell O
their O
neighbours, O
and O
all O
night O
the O
village O
was O
on O
the O
alert. O
Distraught, O
faltering, O
reeling, O
Charles O
wandered O
about O
the O
room. O
He O
knocked O
against O
the O
furniture, O
tore O
his O
hair, O
and O
the O
chemist O
had O
never O
believed O
that O
there O
could O
be O
so O
terrible O
a O
sight. O
He O
went O
home O
to O
write O
to O
Monsieur O
Canivet O
and O
to O
Doctor O
Lariviere. O
He O
lost O
his O
head, O
and O
made O
more O
than O
fifteen O
rough O
copies. O
Hippolyte O
went O
to O
Neufchatel, O
and O
Justin O
so O
spurred O
Bovary's O
horse O
that O
he O
left O
it O
foundered O
and O
three O
parts O
dead O
by O
the O
hill O
at O
Bois-Guillaume. O
Charles O
tried O
to O
look O
up O
his O
medical O
dictionary, O
but O
could O
not O
read O
it; O
the O
lines O
were O
dancing. O
"Be O
calm," O
said O
the O
druggist; O
"we O
have O
only O
to O
administer O
a O
powerful O
antidote. O
What O
is O
the O
poison?" O
Charles O
showed O
him O
the O
letter. O
It O
was O
arsenic. O
"Very O
well," O
said O
Homais, O
"we O
must O
make O
an O
analysis." O
For O
he O
knew O
that O
in O
cases O
of O
poisoning O
an O
analysis O
must O
be O
made; O
and O
the O
other, O
who O
did O
not O
understand, O
answered-- O
"Oh, O
do O
anything! O
save O
her!" O
Then O
going O
back O
to O
her, O
he O
sank O
upon O
the O
carpet, O
and O
lay O
there O
with O
his O
head O
leaning O
against O
the O
edge O
of O
her O
bed, O
sobbing. O
"Don't O
cry," O
she O
said O
to O
him. O
"Soon O
I O
shall O
not O
trouble O
you O
any O
more." O
"Why O
was O
it? O
Who O
drove O
you O
to O
it?" O
She O
replied. O
"It O
had O
to O
be, O
my O
dear!" O
"Weren't O
you O
happy? O
Is O
it O
my O
fault? O
I O
did O
all O
I O
could!" O
"Yes, O
that O
is O
true-- O
you O
are O
good-- O
you." O
And O
she O
passed O
her O
hand O
slowly O
over O
his O
hair. O
The O
sweetness O
of O
this O
sensation O
deepened O
his O
sadness; O
he O
felt O
his O
whole O
being O
dissolving O
in O
despair O
at O
the O
thought O
that O
he O
must O
lose O
her, O
just O
when O
she O
was O
confessing O
more O
love O
for O
him O
than O
ever. O
And O
he O
could O
think O
of O
nothing; O
he O
did O
not O
know, O
he O
did O
not O
dare; O
the O
urgent O
need O
for O
some O
immediate O
resolution O
gave O
the O
finishing O
stroke O
to O
the O
turmoil O
of O
his O
mind. O
So O
she O
had O
done, O
she O
thought, O
with O
all O
the O
treachery; O
and O
meanness, O
and O
numberless O
desires O
that O
had O
tortured O
her. O
She O
hated O
no O
one O
now; O
a O
twilight O
dimness O
was O
settling O
upon O
her O
thoughts, O
and, O
of O
all O
earthly O
noises, O
Emma O
heard O
none O
but O
the O
intermittent O
lamentations O
of O
this O
poor O
heart, O
sweet O
and O
indistinct O
like O
the O
echo O
of O
a O
symphony O
dying O
away. O
"Bring O
me O
the O
child," O
she O
said, O
raising O
herself O
on O
her O
elbow. O
"You O
are O
not O
worse, O
are O
you?" O
asked O
Charles. O
"No, O
no!" O
The O
child, O
serious, O
and O
still O
half-asleep, O
was O
carried O
in O
on O
the O
servant's O
arm O
in O
her O
long O
white O
nightgown, O
from O
which O
her O
bare O
feet O
peeped O
out. O
She O
looked O
wonderingly O
at O
the O
disordered O
room, O
and O
half-closed O
her O
eyes, O
dazzled O
by O
the O
candles O
burning O
on O
the O
table. O
They O
reminded O
her, O
no O
doubt, O
of O
the O
morning O
of O
New O
Year's O
day O
and O
Mid-Lent, O
when O
thus O
awakened O
early O
by O
candle-light O
she O
came O
to O
her O
mother's O
bed O
to O
fetch O
her O
presents, O
for O
she O
began O
saying-- O
"But O
where O
is O
it, O
mamma?" O
And O
as O
everybody O
was O
silent, O
"But O
I O
can't O
see O
my O
little O
stocking." O
Felicite O
held O
her O
over O
the O
bed O
while O
she O
still O
kept O
looking O
towards O
the O
mantelpiece. O
"Has O
nurse O
taken O
it?" O
she O
asked. O
And O
at O
this O
name, O
that O
carried O
her O
back O
to O
the O
memory O
of O
her O
adulteries O
and O
her O
calamities, O
Madame O
Bovary O
turned O
away O
her O
head, O
as O
at O
the O
loathing O
of O
another O
bitterer O
poison O
that O
rose O
to O
her O
mouth. O
But O
Berthe O
remained O
perched O
on O
the O
bed. O
"Oh, O
how O
big O
your O
eyes O
are, O
mamma! O
How O
pale O
you O
are! O
how O
hot O
you O
are!" O
Her O
mother O
looked O
at O
her. O
"I O
am O
frightened!" O
cried O
the O
child, O
recoiling. O
Emma O
took O
her O
hand O
to O
kiss O
it; O
the O
child O
struggled. O
"That O
will O
do. O
Take O
her O
away," O
cried O
Charles, O
who O
was O
sobbing O
in O
the O
alcove. O
Then O
the O
symptoms O
ceased O
for O
a O
moment; O
she O
seemed O
less O
agitated; O
and O
at O
every O
insignificant O
word, O
at O
every O
respiration O
a O
little O
more O
easy, O
he O
regained O
hope. O
At O
last, O
when O
Canivet O
came O
in, O
he O
threw O
himself O
into O
his O
arms. O
"Ah! O
it O
is O
you. O
Thanks! O
You O
are O
good! O
But O
she O
is O
better. O
See! O
look O
at O
her." O
His O
colleague O
was O
by O
no O
means O
of O
this O
opinion, O
and, O
as O
he O
said O
of O
himself, O
"never O
beating O
about O
the O
bush," O
he O
prescribed, O
an O
emetic O
in O
order O
to O
empty O
the O
stomach O
completely. O
She O
soon O
began O
vomiting O
blood. O
Her O
lips O
became O
drawn. O
Her O
limbs O
were O
convulsed, O
her O
whole O
body O
covered O
with O
brown O
spots, O
and O
her O
pulse O
slipped O
beneath O
the O
fingers O
like O
a O
stretched O
thread, O
like O
a O
harp-string O
nearly O
breaking. O
After O
this O
she O
began O
to O
scream O
horribly. O
She O
cursed O
the O
poison, O
railed O
at O
it, O
and O
implored O
it O
to O
be O
quick, O
and O
thrust O
away O
with O
her O
stiffened O
arms O
everything O
that O
Charles, O
in O
more O
agony O
than O
herself, O
tried O
to O
make O
her O
drink. O
He O
stood O
up, O
his O
handkerchief O
to O
his O
lips, O
with O
a O
rattling O
sound O
in O
his O
throat, O
weeping, O
and O
choked O
by O
sobs O
that O
shook O
his O
whole O
body. O
Felicite O
was O
running O
hither O
and O
thither O
in O
the O
room. O
Homais, O
motionless, O
uttered O
great O
sighs; O
and O
Monsieur O
Canivet, O
always O
retaining O
his O
self-command, O
nevertheless O
began O
to O
feel O
uneasy. O
"The O
devil! O
yet O
she O
has O
been O
purged, O
and O
from O
the O
moment O
that O
the O
cause O
ceases O
-- O
" O
"The O
effect O
must O
cease," O
said O
Homais, O
"that O
is O
evident." O
"Oh, O
save O
her!" O
cried O
Bovary. O
And, O
without O
listening O
to O
the O
chemist, O
who O
was O
still O
venturing O
the O
hypothesis, O
"It O
is O
perhaps O
a O
salutary O
paroxysm," O
Canivet O
was O
about O
to O
administer O
some O
theriac, O
when O
they O
heard O
the O
cracking O
of O
a O
whip; O
all O
the O
windows O
rattled, O
and O
a O
post-chaise O
drawn O
by O
three O
horses O
abreast, O
up O
to O
their O
ears O
in O
mud, O
drove O
at O
a O
gallop O
round O
the O
corner O
of O
the O
market. O
It O
was O
Doctor O
Lariviere. O
The O
apparition O
of O
a O
god O
would O
not O
have O
caused O
more O
commotion. O
Bovary O
raised O
his O
hands; O
Canivet O
stopped O
short; O
and O
Homais O
pulled O
off O
his O
skull-cap O
long O
before O
the O
doctor O
had O
come O
in. O
He O
belonged O
to O
that O
great O
school O
of O
surgery O
begotten O
of O
Bichat, O
to O
that O
generation, O
now O
extinct, O
of O
philosophical O
practitioners, O
who, O
loving O
their O
art O
with O
a O
fanatical O
love, O
exercised O
it O
with O
enthusiasm O
and O
wisdom. O
Everyone O
in O
his O
hospital O
trembled O
when O
he O
was O
angry; O
and O
his O
students O
so O
revered O
him O
that O
they O
tried, O
as O
soon O
as O
they O
were O
themselves O
in O
practice, O
to O
imitate O
him O
as O
much O
as O
possible. O
So O
that O
in O
all O
the O
towns O
about O
they O
were O
found O
wearing O
his O
long O
wadded O
merino O
overcoat O
and O
black O
frock-coat, O
whose O
buttoned O
cuffs O
slightly O
covered O
his O
brawny O
hands-- O
very O
beautiful O
hands, O
and O
that O
never O
knew O
gloves, O
as O
though O
to O
be O
more O
ready O
to O
plunge O
into O
suffering. O
Disdainful O
of O
honours, O
of O
titles, O
and O
of O
academies, O
like O
one O
of O
the O
old O
Knight-Hospitallers, O
generous, O
fatherly O
to O
the O
poor, O
and O
practising O
virtue O
without O
believing O
in O
it, O
he O
would O
almost O
have O
passed O
for O
a O
saint O
if O
the O
keenness O
of O
his O
intellect O
had O
not O
caused O
him O
to O
be O
feared O
as O
a O
demon. O
His O
glance, O
more O
penetrating O
than O
his O
bistouries, O
looked O
straight O
into O
your O
soul, O
and O
dissected O
every O
lie O
athwart O
all O
assertions O
and O
all O
reticences. O
And O
thus O
he O
went O
along, O
full O
of O
that O
debonair O
majesty O
that O
is O
given O
by O
the O
consciousness O
of O
great O
talent, O
of O
fortune, O
and O
of O
forty O
years O
of O
a O
labourious O
and O
irreproachable O
life. O
He O
frowned O
as O
soon O
as O
he O
had O
passed O
the O
door O
when O
he O
saw O
the O
cadaverous O
face O
of O
Emma O
stretched O
out O
on O
her O
back O
with O
her O
mouth O
open. O
Then, O
while O
apparently O
listening O
to O
Canivet, O
he O
rubbed O
his O
fingers O
up O
and O
down O
beneath O
his O
nostrils, O
and O
repeated-- O
"Good! O
good!" O
But O
he O
made O
a O
slow O
gesture O
with O
his O
shoulders. O
Bovary O
watched O
him; O
they O
looked O
at O
one O
another; O
and O
this O
man, O
accustomed O
as O
he O
was O
to O
the O
sight O
of O
pain, O
could O
not O
keep O
back O
a O
tear O
that O
fell O
on O
his O
shirt-frill. O
He O
tried O
to O
take O
Canivet O
into O
the O
next O
room. O
Charles O
followed O
him. O
"She O
is O
very O
ill, O
isn't O
she? O
If O
we O
put O
on O
sinapisms? O
Anything! O
Oh, O
think O
of O
something, O
you O
who O
have O
saved O
so O
many!" O
Charles O
caught O
him O
in O
both O
his O
arms, O
and O
gazed O
at O
him O
wildly, O
imploringly, O
half-fainting O
against O
his O
breast. O
"Come, O
my O
poor O
fellow, O
courage! O
There O
is O
nothing O
more O
to O
be O
done." O
And O
Doctor O
Lariviere O
turned O
away. O
"You O
are O
going?" O
"I O
will O
come O
back." O
He O
went O
out O
only O
to O
give O
an O
order O
to O
the O
coachman, O
with O
Monsieur O
Canivet, O
who O
did O
not O
care O
either O
to O
have O
Emma O
die O
under O
his O
hands. O
The O
chemist O
rejoined O
them O
on O
the O
Place. O
He O
could O
not O
by O
temperament O
keep O
away O
from O
celebrities, O
so O
he O
begged O
Monsieur O
Lariviere O
to O
do O
him O
the O
signal O
honour O
of O
accepting O
some O
breakfast. O
He O
sent O
quickly O
to O
the O
"Lion O
d'Or" O
for O
some O
pigeons; O
to O
the O
butcher's O
for O
all O
the O
cutlets O
that O
were O
to O
be O
had; O
to O
Tuvache O
for O
cream; O
and O
to O
Lestiboudois O
for O
eggs; O
and O
the O
druggist O
himself O
aided O
in O
the O
preparations, O
while O
Madame O
Homais O
was O
saying O
as O
she O
pulled O
together O
the O
strings O
of O
her O
jacket-- O
"You O
must O
excuse O
us, O
sir, O
for O
in O
this O
poor O
place, O
when O
one O
hasn't O
been O
told O
the O
night O
before O
-- O
" O
"Wine O
glasses!" O
whispered O
Homais. O
"If O
only O
we O
were O
in O
town, O
we O
could O
fall O
back O
upon O
stuffed O
trotters." O
"Be O
quiet! O
Sit O
down, O
doctor!" O
He O
thought O
fit, O
after O
the O
first O
few O
mouthfuls, O
to O
give O
some O
details O
as O
to O
the O
catastrophe. O
"We O
first O
had O
a O
feeling O
of O
siccity O
in O
the O
pharynx, O
then O
intolerable O
pains O
at O
the O
epigastrium, O
super O
purgation, O
coma." O
"But O
how O
did O
she O
poison O
herself?" O
"I O
don't O
know, O
doctor, O
and O
I O
don't O
even O
know O
where O
she O
can O
have O
procured O
the O
arsenious O
acid." O
Justin, O
who O
was O
just O
bringing O
in O
a O
pile O
of O
plates, O
began O
to O
tremble. O
"What's O
the O
matter?" O
said O
the O
chemist. O
At O
this O
question O
the O
young O
man O
dropped O
the O
whole O
lot O
on O
the O
ground O
with O
a O
crash. O
"Imbecile!" O
cried O
Homais, O
"awkward O
lout! O
block-head! O
confounded O
ass!" O
BUT O
SUDDENLY O
CONTROLLING O
HIMSELF-- O
"I O
wished, O
doctor, O
to O
make O
an O
analysis, O
and O
primo O
I O
delicately O
introduced O
a O
tube O
-- O
" O
"You O
would O
have O
done O
better," O
said O
the O
physician, O
"to O
introduce O
your O
fingers O
into O
her O
throat." O
His O
colleague O
was O
silent, O
having O
just O
before O
privately O
received O
a O
severe O
lecture O
about O
his O
emetic, O
so O
that O
this O
good O
Canivet, O
so O
arrogant O
and O
so O
verbose O
at O
the O
time O
of O
the O
clubfoot, O
was O
to-day O
very O
modest. O
He O
smiled O
without O
ceasing O
in O
an O
approving O
manner. O
Homais O
dilated O
in O
Amphytrionic O
pride, O
and O
the O
affecting O
thought O
of O
Bovary O
vaguely O
contributed O
to O
his O
pleasure O
by O
a O
kind O
of O
egotistic O
reflex O
upon O
himself. O
Then O
the O
presence O
of O
the O
doctor O
transported O
him. O
He O
displayed O
his O
erudition, O
cited O
pell-mell O
cantharides, O
upas, O
the O
manchineel, O
vipers. O
"I O
have O
even O
read O
that O
various O
persons O
have O
found O
themselves O
under O
toxicological O
symptoms, O
and, O
as O
it O
were, O
thunderstricken O
by O
black-pudding O
that O
had O
been O
subjected O
to O
a O
too O
vehement O
fumigation. O
At O
least, O
this O
was O
stated O
in O
a O
very O
fine O
report O
drawn O
up O
by O
one O
of O
our O
pharmaceutical O
chiefs, O
one O
of O
our O
masters, O
the O
illustrious O
Cadet O
de O
Gassicourt!" O
Madame O
Homais O
reappeared, O
carrying O
one O
of O
those O
shaky O
machines O
that O
are O
heated O
with O
spirits O
of O
wine; O
for O
Homais O
liked O
to O
make O
his O
coffee O
at O
table, O
having, O
moreover, O
torrefied O
it, O
pulverised O
it, O
and O
mixed O
it O
himself. O
"Saccharum, O
doctor?" O
said O
he, O
offering O
the O
sugar. O
Then O
he O
had O
all O
his O
children O
brought O
down, O
anxious O
to O
have O
the O
physician's O
opinion O
on O
their O
constitutions. O
At O
last O
Monsieur O
Lariviere O
was O
about O
to O
leave, O
when O
Madame O
Homais O
asked O
for O
a O
consultation O
about O
her O
husband. O
He O
was O
making O
his O
blood O
too O
thick O
by O
going O
to O
sleep O
every O
evening O
after O
dinner. O
"Oh, O
it O
isn't O
his O
blood O
that's O
too O
thick," O
said O
the O
physician. O
And, O
smiling O
a O
little O
at O
his O
unnoticed O
joke, O
the O
doctor O
opened O
the O
door. O
But O
the O
chemist's O
shop O
was O
full O
of O
people; O
he O
had O
the O
greatest O
difficulty O
in O
getting O
rid O
of O
Monsieur O
Tuvache, O
who O
feared O
his O
spouse O
would O
get O
inflammation O
of O
the O
lungs, O
because O
she O
was O
in O
the O
habit O
of O
spitting O
on O
the O
ashes; O
then O
of O
Monsieur O
Binet, O
who O
sometimes O
experienced O
sudden O
attacks O
of O
great O
hunger; O
and O
of O
Madame O
Caron, O
who O
suffered O
from O
tinglings; O
of O
Lheureux, O
who O
had O
vertigo; O
of O
Lestiboudois, O
who O
had O
rheumatism; O
and O
of O
Madame O
Lefrancois, O
who O
had O
heartburn. O
At O
last O
the O
three O
horses O
started; O
and O
it O
was O
the O
general O
opinion O
that O
he O
had O
not O
shown O
himself O
at O
all O
obliging. O
Public O
attention O
was O
distracted O
by O
the O
appearance O
of O
Monsieur O
Bournisien, O
who O
was O
going O
across O
the O
market O
with O
the O
holy O
oil. O
Homais, O
as O
was O
due O
to O
his O
principles, O
compared O
priests O
to O
ravens O
attracted O
by O
the O
odour O
of O
death. O
The O
sight O
of O
an O
ecclesiastic O
was O
personally O
disagreeable O
to O
him, O
for O
the O
cassock O
made O
him O
think O
of O
the O
shroud, O
and O
he O
detested O
the O
one O
from O
some O
fear O
of O
the O
other. O
Nevertheless, O
not O
shrinking O
from O
what O
he O
called O
his O
mission, O
he O
returned O
to O
Bovary's O
in O
company O
with O
Canivet O
whom O
Monsieur O
Lariviere, O
before O
leaving, O
had O
strongly O
urged O
to O
make O
this O
visit; O
and O
he O
would, O
but O
for O
his O
wife's O
objections, O
have O
taken O
his O
two O
sons O
with O
him, O
in O
order O
to O
accustom O
them O
to O
great O
occasions; O
that O
this O
might O
be O
a O
lesson, O
an O
example, O
a O
solemn O
picture, O
that O
should O
remain O
in O
their O
heads O
later O
on. O
The O
room O
when O
they O
went O
in O
was O
full O
of O
mournful O
solemnity. O
On O
the O
work-table, O
covered O
over O
with O
a O
white O
cloth, O
there O
were O
five O
or O
six O
small O
balls O
of O
cotton O
in O
a O
silver O
dish, O
near O
a O
large O
crucifix O
between O
two O
lighted O
candles. O
Emma, O
her O
chin O
sunken O
upon O
her O
breast, O
had O
her O
eyes O
inordinately O
wide O
open, O
and O
her O
poor O
hands O
wandered O
over O
the O
sheets O
with O
that O
hideous O
and O
soft O
movement O
of O
the O
dying, O
that O
seems O
as O
if O
they O
wanted O
already O
to O
cover O
themselves O
with O
the O
shroud. O
Pale O
as O
a O
statue O
and O
with O
eyes O
red O
as O
fire, O
Charles, O
not O
weeping, O
stood O
opposite O
her O
at O
the O
foot O
of O
the O
bed, O
while O
the O
priest, O
bending O
one O
knee, O
was O
muttering O
words O
in O
a O
low O
voice. O
She O
turned O
her O
face O
slowly, O
and O
seemed O
filled O
with O
joy O
on O
seeing O
suddenly O
the O
violet O
stole, O
no O
doubt O
finding O
again, O
in O
the O
midst O
of O
a O
temporary O
lull O
in O
her O
pain, O
the O
lost O
voluptuousness O
of O
her O
first O
mystical O
transports, O
with O
the O
visions O
of O
eternal O
beatitude O
that O
were O
beginning. O
The O
priest O
rose O
to O
take O
the O
crucifix; O
then O
she O
stretched O
forward O
her O
neck O
as O
one O
who O
is O
athirst, O
and O
glueing O
her O
lips O
to O
the O
body O
of O
the O
Man-God, O
she O
pressed O
upon O
it O
with O
all O
her O
expiring O
strength O
the O
fullest O
kiss O
of O
love O
that O
she O
had O
ever O
given. O
Then O
he O
recited O
the O
Misereatur O
and O
the O
Indulgentiam, O
dipped O
his O
right O
thumb O
in O
the O
oil, O
and O
began O
to O
give O
extreme O
unction. O
First O
upon O
the O
eyes, O
that O
had O
so O
coveted O
all O
worldly O
pomp; O
then O
upon O
the O
nostrils, O
that O
had O
been O
greedy O
of O
the O
warm O
breeze O
and O
amorous O
odours; O
then O
upon O
the O
mouth, O
that O
had O
uttered O
lies, O
that O
had O
curled O
with O
pride O
and O
cried O
out O
in O
lewdness; O
then O
upon O
the O
hands O
that O
had O
delighted O
in O
sensual O
touches; O
and O
finally O
upon O
the O
soles O
of O
the O
feet, O
so O
swift O
of O
yore, O
when O
she O
was O
running O
to O
satisfy O
her O
desires, O
and O
that O
would O
now O
walk O
no O
more. O
The O
cure O
wiped O
his O
fingers, O
threw O
the O
bit O
of O
cotton O
dipped O
in O
oil O
into O
the O
fire, O
and O
came O
and O
sat O
down O
by O
the O
dying O
woman, O
to O
tell O
her O
that O
she O
must O
now O
blend O
her O
sufferings O
with O
those O
of O
Jesus O
Christ O
and O
abandon O
herself O
to O
the O
divine O
mercy. O
Finishing O
his O
exhortations, O
he O
tried O
to O
place O
in O
her O
hand O
a O
blessed O
candle, O
symbol O
of O
the O
celestial O
glory O
with O
which O
she O
was O
soon O
to O
be O
surrounded. O
Emma, O
too O
weak, O
could O
not O
close O
her O
fingers, O
and O
the O
taper, O
but O
for O
Monsieur O
Bournisien O
would O
have O
fallen O
to O
the O
ground. O
However, O
she O
was O
not O
quite O
so O
pale, O
and O
her O
face O
had O
an O
expression O
of O
serenity O
as O
if O
the O
sacrament O
had O
cured O
her. O
The O
priest O
did O
not O
fail O
to O
point O
this O
out; O
he O
even O
explained O
to O
Bovary O
that O
the O
Lord O
sometimes O
prolonged O
the O
life O
of O
persons O
when O
he O
thought O
it O
meet O
for O
their O
salvation; O
and O
Charles O
remembered O
the O
day O
when, O
so O
near O
death, O
she O
had O
received O
the O
communion. O
Perhaps O
there O
was O
no O
need O
to O
despair, O
he O
thought. O
In O
fact, O
she O
looked O
around O
her O
slowly, O
as O
one O
awakening O
from O
a O
dream; O
then O
in O
a O
distinct O
voice O
she O
asked O
for O
her O
looking-glass, O
and O
remained O
some O
time O
bending O
over O
it, O
until O
the O
big O
tears O
fell O
from O
her O
eyes. O
Then O
she O
turned O
away O
her O
head O
with O
a O
sigh O
and O
fell O
back O
upon O
the O
pillows. O
Her O
chest O
soon O
began O
panting O
rapidly; O
the O
whole O
of O
her O
tongue O
protruded O
from O
her O
mouth; O
her O
eyes, O
as O
they O
rolled, O
grew O
paler, O
like O
the O
two O
globes O
of O
a O
lamp O
that O
is O
going O
out, O
so O
that O
one O
might O
have O
thought O
her O
already O
dead O
but O
for O
the O
fearful O
labouring O
of O
her O
ribs, O
shaken O
by O
violent O
breathing, O
as O
if O
the O
soul O
were O
struggling O
to O
free O
itself. O
Felicite O
knelt O
down O
before O
the O
crucifix, O
and O
the O
druggist O
himself O
slightly O
bent O
his O
knees, O
while O
Monsieur O
Canivet O
looked O
out O
vaguely O
at O
the O
Place. O
Bournisien O
had O
again O
begun O
to O
pray, O
his O
face O
bowed O
against O
the O
edge O
of O
the O
bed, O
his O
long O
black O
cassock O
trailing O
behind O
him O
in O
the O
room. O
Charles O
was O
on O
the O
other O
side, O
on O
his O
knees, O
his O
arms O
outstretched O
towards O
Emma. O
He O
had O
taken O
her O
hands O
and O
pressed O
them, O
shuddering O
at O
every O
beat O
of O
her O
heart, O
as O
at O
the O
shaking O
of O
a O
falling O
ruin. O
As O
the O
death-rattle O
became O
stronger O
the O
priest O
prayed O
faster; O
his O
prayers O
mingled O
with O
the O
stifled O
sobs O
of O
Bovary, O
and O
sometimes O
all O
seemed O
lost O
in O
the O
muffled O
murmur O
of O
the O
Latin O
syllables O
that O
tolled O
like O
a O
passing O
bell. O
Suddenly O
on O
the O
pavement O
was O
heard O
a O
loud O
noise O
of O
clogs O
and O
the O
clattering O
of O
a O
stick; O
and O
a O
voice O
rose O
-- O
a O
raucous O
voice-- O
that O
sang-- O
"Maids O
in O
the O
warmth O
of O
a O
summer O
day O
Dream O
of O
love O
and O
of O
love O
always" O
Emma O
raised O
herself O
like O
a O
galvanised O
corpse, O
her O
hair O
undone, O
her O
eyes O
fixed, O
staring. O
"Where O
the O
sickle O
blades O
have O
been, O
Nannette, O
gathering O
ears O
of O
corn, O
Passes O
bending O
down, O
my O
queen, O
To O
the O
earth O
where O
they O
were O
born." O
"The O
blind O
man!" O
she O
cried. O
And O
Emma O
began O
to O
laugh, O
an O
atrocious, O
frantic, O
despairing O
laugh, O
thinking O
she O
saw O
the O
hideous O
face O
of O
the O
poor O
wretch O
that O
stood O
out O
against O
the O
eternal O
night O
like O
a O
menace. O
"The O
wind O
is O
strong O
this O
summer O
day, O
Her O
petticoat O
has O
flown O
away." O
She O
fell O
back O
upon O
the O
mattress O
in O
a O
convulsion. O
They O
all O
drew O
near. O
She O
was O
dead. O
CHAPTER O
NINE O
There O
is O
always O
after O
the O
death O
of O
anyone O
a O
kind O
of O
stupefaction; O
so O
difficult O
is O
it O
to O
grasp O
this O
advent O
of O
nothingness O
and O
to O
resign O
ourselves O
to O
believe O
in O
it. O
But O
still, O
when O
he O
saw O
that O
she O
did O
not O
move, O
Charles O
threw O
himself O
upon O
her, O
crying-- O
"Farewell! O
farewell!" O
Homais O
and O
Canivet O
dragged O
him O
from O
the O
room. O
"Restrain O
yourself!" O
"Yes." O
said O
he, O
struggling, O
"I'll O
be O
quiet. O
I'll O
not O
do O
anything. O
But O
leave O
me O
alone. O
I O
want O
to O
see O
her. O
She O
is O
my O
wife!" O
And O
he O
wept. O
"Cry," O
said O
the O
chemist; O
"let O
nature O
take O
her O
course; O
that O
will O
solace O
you." O
Weaker O
than O
a O
child, O
Charles O
let O
himself O
be O
led O
downstairs O
into O
the O
sitting-room, O
and O
Monsieur O
Homais O
soon O
went O
home. O
On O
the O
Place O
he O
was O
accosted O
by O
the O
blind O
man, O
who, O
having O
dragged O
himself O
as O
far O
as O
Yonville, O
in O
the O
hope O
of O
getting O
the O
antiphlogistic O
pomade, O
was O
asking O
every O
passer-by O
where O
the O
druggist O
lived. O
"There O
now! O
as O
if O
I O
hadn't O
got O
other O
fish O
to O
fry. O
Well, O
so O
much O
the O
worse; O
you O
must O
come O
later O
on." O
And O
he O
entered O
the O
shop O
hurriedly. O
He O
had O
to O
write O
two O
letters, O
to O
prepare O
a O
soothing O
potion O
for O
Bovary, O
to O
invent O
some O
lie O
that O
would O
conceal O
the O
poisoning, O
and O
work O
it O
up O
into O
an O
article O
for O
the O
"Fanal," O
without O
counting O
the O
people O
who O
were O
waiting O
to O
get O
the O
news O
from O
him; O
and O
when O
the O
Yonvillers O
had O
all O
heard O
his O
story O
of O
the O
arsenic O
that O
she O
had O
mistaken O
for O
sugar O
in O
making O
a O
vanilla O
cream. O
Homais O
once O
more O
returned O
to O
Bovary's. O
He O
found O
him O
alone O
(Monsieur O
Canivet O
had O
left), O
sitting O
in O
an O
arm-chair O
near O
the O
window, O
staring O
with O
an O
idiotic O
look O
at O
the O
flags O
of O
the O
floor. O
"Now," O
said O
the O
chemist, O
"you O
ought O
yourself O
to O
fix O
the O
hour O
for O
the O
ceremony." O
"Why? O
What O
ceremony?" O
Then, O
in O
a O
stammering, O
frightened O
voice, O
"Oh, O
no! O
not O
that. O
No! O
I O
want O
to O
see O
her O
here." O
Homais, O
to O
keep O
himself O
in O
countenance, O
took O
up O
a O
water-bottle O
on O
the O
whatnot O
to O
water O
the O
geraniums. O
"Ah! O
thanks," O
said O
Charles; O
"you O
are O
good." O
But O
he O
did O
not O
finish, O
choking O
beneath O
the O
crowd O
of O
memories O
that O
this O
action O
of O
the O
druggist O
recalled O
to O
him. O
Then O
to O
distract O
him, O
Homais O
thought O
fit O
to O
talk O
a O
little O
horticulture: O
plants O
wanted O
humidity. O
Charles O
bowed O
his O
head O
in O
sign O
of O
approbation. O
"Besides, O
the O
fine O
days O
will O
soon O
be O
here O
again." O
"Ah!" O
said O
Bovary. O
The O
druggist, O
at O
his O
wit's O
end, O
began O
softly O
to O
draw O
aside O
the O
small O
window-curtain. O
"Hallo! O
there's O
Monsieur O
Tuvache O
passing." O
CHARLES O
REPEATED O
LIKE O
A O
MACHINE-- O
"Monsieur O
Tuvache O
passing!" O
Homais O
did O
not O
dare O
to O
speak O
to O
him O
again O
about O
the O
funeral O
arrangements; O
it O
was O
the O
priest O
who O
succeeded O
in O
reconciling O
him O
to O
them. O
He O
shut O
himself O
up O
in O
his O
consulting-room, O
took O
a O
pen, O
and O
after O
sobbing O
for O
some O
time, O
wrote-- O
"I O
wish O
her O
to O
be O
buried O
in O
her O
wedding-dress, O
with O
white O
shoes, O
and O
a O
wreath. O
Her O
hair O
is O
to O
be O
spread O
out O
over O
her O
shoulders. O
Three O
coffins, O
one O
of O
oak, O
one O
of O
mahogany, O
one O
of O
lead. O
Let O
no O
one O
say O
anything O
to O
me. O
I O
shall O
have O
strength. O
Over O
all O
there O
is O
to O
be O
placed O
a O
large O
piece O
of O
green O
velvet. O
This O
is O
my O
wish; O
see O
that O
it O
is O
done." O
The O
two O
men O
were O
much O
surprised O
at O
Bovary's O
romantic O
ideas. O
The O
chemist O
at O
once O
went O
to O
him O
and O
said-- O
"This O
velvet O
seems O
to O
me O
a O
superfetation. O
Besides, O
the O
expense O
-- O
" O
"What's O
that O
to O
you?" O
cried O
Charles. O
"Leave O
me! O
You O
did O
not O
love O
her. O
Go!" O
The O
priest O
took O
him O
by O
the O
arm O
for O
a O
turn O
in O
the O
garden. O
He O
discoursed O
on O
the O
vanity O
of O
earthly O
things. O
God O
was O
very O
great, O
was O
very O
good: O
one O
must O
submit O
to O
his O
decrees O
without O
a O
murmur; O
nay, O
must O
even O
thank O
him. O
Charles O
burst O
out O
into O
blasphemies: O
"I O
hate O
your O
God!" O
"The O
spirit O
of O
rebellion O
is O
still O
upon O
you," O
sighed O
the O
ecclesiastic. O
Bovary O
was O
far O
away. O
He O
was O
walking O
with O
great O
strides O
along O
by O
the O
wall, O
near O
the O
espalier, O
and O
he O
ground O
his O
teeth; O
he O
raised O
to O
heaven O
looks O
of O
malediction, O
but O
not O
so O
much O
as O
a O
leaf O
stirred. O
A O
fine O
rain O
was O
falling: O
Charles, O
whose O
chest O
was O
bare, O
at O
last O
began O
to O
shiver; O
he O
went O
in O
and O
sat O
down O
in O
the O
kitchen. O
At O
six O
o'clock O
a O
noise O
like O
a O
clatter O
of O
old O
iron O
was O
heard O
on O
the O
Place; O
it O
was O
the O
"Hirondelle" O
coming O
in, O
and O
he O
remained O
with O
his O
forehead O
against O
the O
windowpane, O
watching O
all O
the O
passengers O
get O
out, O
one O
after O
the O
other. O
Felicite O
put O
down O
a O
mattress O
for O
him O
in O
the O
drawing-room. O
He O
threw O
himself O
upon O
it O
and O
fell O
asleep. O
Although O
a O
philosopher, O
Monsieur O
Homais O
respected O
the O
dead. O
So O
bearing O
no O
grudge O
to O
poor O
Charles, O
he O
came O
back O
again O
in O
the O
evening O
to O
sit O
up O
with O
the O
body; O
bringing O
with O
him O
three O
volumes O
and O
a O
pocket-book O
for O
taking O
notes. O
Monsieur O
Bournisien O
was O
there, O
and O
two O
large O
candles O
were O
burning O
at O
the O
head O
of O
the O
bed, O
that O
had O
been O
taken O
out O
of O
the O
alcove. O
The O
druggist, O
on O
whom O
the O
silence O
weighed, O
was O
not O
long O
before O
he O
began O
formulating O
some O
regrets O
about O
this O
"unfortunate O
young O
woman." O
and O
the O
priest O
replied O
that O
there O
was O
nothing O
to O
do O
now O
but O
pray O
for O
her. O
"Yet," O
Homais O
went O
on, O
"one O
of O
two O
things; O
either O
she O
died O
in O
a O
state O
of O
grace O
(as O
the O
Church O
has O
it), O
and O
then O
she O
has O
no O
need O
of O
our O
prayers; O
or O
else O
she O
departed O
impertinent O
(that O
is, O
I O
believe, O
the O
ecclesiastical O
expression), O
and O
then O
-- O
" O
Bournisien O
interrupted O
him, O
replying O
testily O
that O
it O
was O
none O
the O
less O
necessary O
to O
pray. O
"But," O
objected O
the O
chemist, O
"since O
God O
knows O
all O
our O
needs, O
what O
can O
be O
the O
good O
of O
prayer?" O
"What!" O
cried O
the O
ecclesiastic, O
"prayer! O
Why, O
aren't O
you O
a O
Christian?" O
"Excuse O
me," O
said O
Homais; O
"I O
admire O
Christianity. O
To O
begin O
with, O
it O
enfranchised O
the O
slaves, O
introduced O
into O
the O
world O
a O
morality O
-- O
" O
"That O
isn't O
the O
question. O
All O
the O
texts-" O
"Oh! O
oh! O
As O
to O
texts, O
look O
at O
history; O
it, O
is O
known O
that O
all O
the O
texts O
have O
been O
falsified O
by O
the O
Jesuits." O
Charles O
came O
in, O
and O
advancing O
towards O
the O
bed, O
slowly O
drew O
the O
curtains. O
Emma's O
head O
was O
turned O
towards O
her O
right O
shoulder, O
the O
corner O
of O
her O
mouth, O
which O
was O
open, O
seemed O
like O
a O
black O
hole O
at O
the O
lower O
part O
of O
her O
face; O
her O
two O
thumbs O
were O
bent O
into O
the O
palms O
of O
her O
hands; O
a O
kind O
of O
white O
dust O
besprinkled O
her O
lashes, O
and O
her O
eyes O
were O
beginning O
to O
disappear O
in O
that O
viscous O
pallor O
that O
looks O
like O
a O
thin O
web, O
as O
if O
spiders O
had O
spun O
it O
over. O
The O
sheet O
sunk O
in O
from O
her O
breast O
to O
her O
knees, O
and O
then O
rose O
at O
the O
tips O
of O
her O
toes, O
and O
it O
seemed O
to O
Charles O
that O
infinite O
masses, O
an O
enormous O
load, O
were O
weighing O
upon O
her. O
The O
church O
clock O
struck O
two. O
They O
could O
hear O
the O
loud O
murmur O
of O
the O
river O
flowing O
in O
the O
darkness O
at O
the O
foot O
of O
the O
terrace. O
Monsieur O
Bournisien O
from O
time O
to O
time O
blew O
his O
nose O
noisily, O
and O
Homais' O
pen O
was O
scratching O
over O
the O
paper. O
"Come, O
my O
good O
friend," O
he O
said, O
"withdraw; O
this O
spectacle O
is O
tearing O
you O
to O
pieces." O
Charles O
once O
gone, O
the O
chemist O
and O
the O
cure O
recommenced O
their O
discussions. O
"Read O
Voltaire," O
said O
the O
one, O
"read O
D'Holbach, O
read O
the O
'Encyclopaedia'!" O
"Read O
the O
'Letters O
of O
some O
Portuguese O
Jews,'" O
said O
the O
other; O
"read O
'The O
Meaning O
of O
Christianity,' O
by O
Nicolas, O
formerly O
a O
magistrate." O
They O
grew O
warm, O
they O
grew O
red, O
they O
both O
talked O
at O
once O
without O
listening O
to O
each O
other. O
Bournisien O
was O
scandalized O
at O
such O
audacity; O
Homais O
marvelled O
at O
such O
stupidity; O
and O
they O
were O
on O
the O
point O
of O
insulting O
one O
another O
when O
Charles O
suddenly O
reappeared. O
A O
fascination O
drew O
him. O
He O
was O
continually O
coming O
upstairs. O
He O
stood O
opposite O
her, O
the O
better O
to O
see O
her, O
and O
he O
lost O
himself O
in O
a O
contemplation O
so O
deep O
that O
it O
was O
no O
longer O
painful. O
He O
recalled O
stories O
of O
catalepsy, O
the O
marvels O
of O
magnetism, O
and O
he O
said O
to O
himself O
that O
by O
willing O
it O
with O
all O
his O
force O
he O
might O
perhaps O
succeed O
in O
reviving O
her. O
Once O
he O
even O
bent O
towards O
he, O
and O
cried O
in O
a O
low O
voice, O
"Emma! O
Emma!" O
His O
strong O
breathing O
made O
the O
flames O
of O
the O
candles O
tremble O
against O
the O
wall. O
At O
daybreak O
Madame O
Bovary O
senior O
arrived. O
Charles O
as O
he O
embraced O
her O
burst O
into O
another O
flood O
of O
tears. O
She O
tried, O
as O
the O
chemist O
had O
done, O
to O
make O
some O
remarks O
to O
him O
on O
the O
expenses O
of O
the O
funeral. O
He O
became O
so O
angry O
that O
she O
was O
silent, O
and O
he O
even O
commissioned O
her O
to O
go O
to O
town O
at O
once O
and O
buy O
what O
was O
necessary. O
Charles O
remained O
alone O
the O
whole O
afternoon; O
they O
had O
taken O
Berthe O
to O
Madame O
Homais'; O
Felicite O
was O
in O
the O
room O
upstairs O
with O
Madame O
Lefrancois. O
In O
the O
evening O
he O
had O
some O
visitors. O
He O
rose, O
pressed O
their O
hands, O
unable O
to O
speak. O
Then O
they O
sat O
down O
near O
one O
another, O
and O
formed O
a O
large O
semicircle O
in O
front O
of O
the O
fire. O
With O
lowered O
faces, O
and O
swinging O
one O
leg O
crossed O
over O
the O
other O
knee, O
they O
uttered O
deep O
sighs O
at O
intervals; O
each O
one O
was O
inordinately O
bored, O
and O
yet O
none O
would O
be O
the O
first O
to O
go. O
Homais, O
when O
he O
returned O
at O
nine O
o'clock O
(for O
the O
last O
two O
days O
only O
Homais O
seemed O
to O
have O
been O
on O
the O
Place), O
was O
laden O
with O
a O
stock O
of O
camphor, O
of O
benzine, O
and O
aromatic O
herbs. O
He O
also O
carried O
a O
large O
jar O
full O
of O
chlorine O
water, O
to O
keep O
off O
all O
miasmata. O
Just O
then O
the O
servant, O
Madame O
Lefrancois, O
and O
Madame O
Bovary O
senior O
were O
busy O
about O
Emma, O
finishing O
dressing O
her, O
and O
they O
were O
drawing O
down O
the O
long O
stiff O
veil O
that O
covered O
her O
to O
her O
satin O
shoes. O
Felicite O
was O
sobbing-- O
"Ah! O
my O
poor O
mistress! O
my O
poor O
mistress!" O
"Look O
at O
her," O
said O
the O
landlady, O
sighing; O
"how O
pretty O
she O
still O
is! O
Now, O
couldn't O
you O
swear O
she O
was O
going O
to O
get O
up O
in O
a O
minute?" O
Then O
they O
bent O
over O
her O
to O
put O
on O
her O
wreath. O
They O
had O
to O
raise O
the O
head O
a O
little, O
and O
a O
rush O
of O
black O
liquid O
issued, O
as O
if O
she O
were O
vomiting, O
from O
her O
mouth. O
"Oh, O
goodness! O
The O
dress; O
take O
care!" O
cried O
Madame O
Lefrancois. O
"Now, O
just O
come O
and O
help," O
she O
said O
to O
the O
chemist. O
"Perhaps O
you're O
afraid?" O
"I O
afraid?" O
replied O
he, O
shrugging O
his O
shoulders. O
"I O
dare O
say! O
I've O
seen O
all O
sorts O
of O
things O
at O
the O
hospital O
when O
I O
was O
studying O
pharmacy. O
We O
used O
to O
make O
punch O
in O
the O
dissecting O
room! O
Nothingness O
does O
not O
terrify O
a O
philosopher; O
and, O
as O
I O
often O
say, O
I O
even O
intend O
to O
leave O
my O
body O
to O
the O
hospitals, O
in O
order, O
later O
on, O
to O
serve O
science." O
The O
cure O
on O
his O
arrival O
inquired O
how O
Monsieur O
Bovary O
was, O
and, O
on O
the O
reply O
of O
the O
druggist, O
went O
on-- O
"The O
blow, O
you O
see, O
is O
still O
too O
recent." O
Then O
Homais O
congratulated O
him O
on O
not O
being O
exposed, O
like O
other O
people, O
to O
the O
loss O
of O
a O
beloved O
companion; O
whence O
there O
followed O
a O
discussion O
on O
the O
celibacy O
of O
priests. O
"For," O
said O
the O
chemist, O
"it O
is O
unnatural O
that O
a O
man O
should O
do O
without O
women! O
There O
have O
been O
crimes O
-- O
" O
"But, O
good O
heaven!" O
cried O
the O
ecclesiastic, O
"how O
do O
you O
expect O
an O
individual O
who O
is O
married O
to O
keep O
the O
secrets O
of O
the O
confessional, O
for O
example?" O
Homais O
fell O
foul O
of O
the O
confessional. O
Bournisien O
defended O
it; O
he O
enlarged O
on O
the O
acts O
of O
restitution O
that O
it O
brought O
about. O
He O
cited O
various O
anecdotes O
about O
thieves O
who O
had O
suddenly O
become O
honest. O
Military O
men O
on O
approaching O
the O
tribunal O
of O
penitence O
had O
felt O
the O
scales O
fall O
from O
their O
eyes. O
At O
Fribourg O
there O
was O
a O
minister-- O
His O
companion O
was O
asleep. O
Then O
he O
felt O
somewhat O
stifled O
by O
the O
over-heavy O
atmosphere O
of O
the O
room; O
he O
opened O
the O
window; O
this O
awoke O
the O
chemist. O
"Come, O
take O
a O
pinch O
of O
snuff," O
he O
said O
to O
him. O
"Take O
it; O
it'll O
relieve O
you." O
A O
continual O
barking O
was O
heard O
in O
the O
distance. O
"Do O
you O
hear O
that O
dog O
howling?" O
said O
the O
chemist. O
"They O
smell O
the O
dead," O
replied O
the O
priest. O
"It's O
like O
bees; O
they O
leave O
their O
hives O
on O
the O
decease O
of O
any O
person." O
Homais O
made O
no O
remark O
upon O
these O
prejudices, O
for O
he O
had O
again O
dropped O
asleep. O
Monsieur O
Bournisien, O
stronger O
than O
he, O
went O
on O
moving O
his O
lips O
gently O
for O
some O
time, O
then O
insensibly O
his O
chin O
sank O
down, O
he O
let O
fall O
his O
big O
black O
boot, O
and O
began O
to O
snore. O
They O
sat O
opposite O
one O
another, O
with O
protruding O
stomachs, O
puffed-up O
faces, O
and O
frowning O
looks, O
after O
so O
much O
disagreement O
uniting O
at O
last O
in O
the O
same O
human O
weakness, O
and O
they O
moved O
no O
more O
than O
the O
corpse O
by O
their O
side, O
that O
seemed O
to O
be O
sleeping. O
Charles O
coming O
in O
did O
not O
wake O
them. O
It O
was O
the O
last O
time; O
he O
came O
to O
bid O
her O
farewell. O
The O
aromatic O
herbs O
were O
still O
smoking, O
and O
spirals O
of O
bluish O
vapour O
blended O
at O
the O
window-sash O
with O
the O
fog O
that O
was O
coming O
in. O
There O
were O
few O
stars, O
and O
the O
night O
was O
warm. O
The O
wax O
of O
the O
candles O
fell O
in O
great O
drops O
upon O
the O
sheets O
of O
the O
bed. O
Charles O
watched O
them O
burn, O
tiring O
his O
eyes O
against O
the O
glare O
of O
their O
yellow O
flame. O
The O
watering O
on O
the O
satin O
gown O
shimmered O
white O
as O
moonlight. O
Emma O
was O
lost O
beneath O
it; O
and O
it O
seemed O
to O
him O
that, O
spreading O
beyond O
her O
own O
self, O
she O
blended O
confusedly O
with O
everything O
around O
her-- O
the O
silence, O
the O
night, O
the O
passing O
wind, O
the O
damp O
odours O
rising O
from O
the O
ground. O
Then O
suddenly O
he O
saw O
her O
in O
the O
garden O
at O
Tostes, O
on O
a O
bench O
against O
the O
thorn O
hedge, O
or O
else O
at O
Rouen O
in O
the O
streets, O
on O
the O
threshold O
of O
their O
house, O
in O
the O
yard O
at O
Bertaux. O
He O
again O
heard O
the O
laughter O
of O
the O
happy O
boys O
beneath O
the O
apple-trees: O
the O
room O
was O
filled O
with O
the O
perfume O
of O
her O
hair; O
and O
her O
dress O
rustled O
in O
his O
arms O
with O
a O
noise O
like O
electricity. O
The O
dress O
was O
still O
the O
same. O
For O
a O
long O
while O
he O
thus O
recalled O
all O
his O
lost O
joys, O
her O
attitudes, O
her O
movements, O
the O
sound O
of O
her O
voice. O
Upon O
one O
fit O
of O
despair O
followed O
another, O
and O
even O
others, O
inexhaustible O
as O
the O
waves O
of O
an O
overflowing O
sea. O
A O
terrible O
curiosity O
seized O
him. O
Slowly, O
with O
the O
tips O
of O
his O
fingers, O
palpitating, O
he O
lifted O
her O
veil. O
But O
he O
uttered O
a O
cry O
of O
horror O
that O
awoke O
the O
other O
two. O
They O
dragged O
him O
down O
into O
the O
sitting-room. O
Then O
Felicite O
came O
up O
to O
say O
that O
he O
wanted O
some O
of O
her O
hair. O
"Cut O
some O
off," O
replied O
the O
druggist. O
And O
as O
she O
did O
not O
dare O
to, O
he O
himself O
stepped O
forward, O
scissors O
in O
hand. O
He O
trembled O
so O
that O
he O
pierced O
the O
skin O
of O
the O
temple O
in O
several O
places. O
At O
last, O
stiffening O
himself O
against O
emotion, O
Homais O
gave O
two O
or O
three O
great O
cuts O
at O
random O
that O
left O
white O
patches O
amongst O
that O
beautiful O
black O
hair. O
The O
chemist O
and O
the O
cure O
plunged O
anew O
into O
their O
occupations, O
not O
without O
sleeping O
from O
time O
to O
time, O
of O
which O
they O
accused O
each O
other O
reciprocally O
at O
each O
fresh O
awakening. O
Then O
Monsieur O
Bournisien O
sprinkled O
the O
room O
with O
holy O
water O
and O
Homais O
threw O
a O
little O
chlorine O
water O
on O
the O
floor. O
Felicite O
had O
taken O
care O
to O
put O
on O
the O
chest O
of O
drawers, O
for O
each O
of O
them, O
a O
bottle O
of O
brandy, O
some O
cheese, O
and O
a O
large O
roll. O
And O
the O
druggist, O
who O
could O
not O
hold O
out O
any O
longer, O
about O
four O
in O
the O
morning O
sighed-- O
"My O
word! O
I O
should O
like O
to O
take O
some O
sustenance." O
The O
priest O
did O
not O
need O
any O
persuading; O
he O
went O
out O
to O
go O
and O
say O
mass, O
came O
back, O
and O
then O
they O
ate O
and O
hobnobbed, O
giggling O
a O
little O
without O
knowing O
why, O
stimulated O
by O
that O
vague O
gaiety O
that O
comes O
upon O
us O
after O
times O
of O
sadness, O
and O
at O
the O
last O
glass O
the O
priest O
said O
to O
the O
druggist, O
as O
he O
clapped O
him O
on O
the O
shoulder-- O
"We O
shall O
end O
by O
understanding O
one O
another." O
In O
the O
passage O
downstairs O
they O
met O
the O
undertaker's O
men, O
who O
were O
coming O
in. O
Then O
Charles O
for O
two O
hours O
had O
to O
suffer O
the O
torture O
of O
hearing O
the O
hammer O
resound O
against O
the O
wood. O
Next O
day O
they O
lowered O
her O
into O
her O
oak O
coffin, O
that O
was O
fitted O
into O
the O
other O
two; O
but O
as O
the O
bier O
was O
too O
large, O
they O
had O
to O
fill O
up O
the O
gaps O
with O
the O
wool O
of O
a O
mattress. O
At O
last, O
when O
the O
three O
lids O
had O
been O
planed O
down, O
nailed, O
soldered, O
it O
was O
placed O
outside O
in O
front O
of O
the O
door; O
the O
house O
was O
thrown O
open, O
and O
the O
people O
of O
Yonville O
began O
to O
flock O
round. O
Old O
Rouault O
arrived, O
and O
fainted O
on O
the O
Place O
when O
he O
saw O
the O
black O
cloth! O
CHAPTER O
TEN O
He O
had O
only O
received O
the O
chemist's O
letter O
thirty-six O
hours O
after O
the O
event; O
and, O
from O
consideration O
for O
his O
feelings, O
Homais O
had O
so O
worded O
it O
that O
it O
was O
impossible O
to O
make O
out O
what O
it O
was O
all O
about. O
First, O
the O
old O
fellow O
had O
fallen O
as O
if O
struck O
by O
apoplexy. O
Next, O
he O
understood O
that O
she O
was O
not O
dead, O
but O
she O
might O
be. O
At O
last, O
he O
had O
put O
on O
his O
blouse, O
taken O
his O
hat, O
fastened O
his O
spurs O
to O
his O
boots, O
and O
set O
out O
at O
full O
speed; O
and O
the O
whole O
of O
the O
way O
old O
Rouault, O
panting, O
was O
torn O
by O
anguish. O
Once O
even O
he O
was O
obliged O
to O
dismount. O
He O
was O
dizzy; O
he O
heard O
voices O
round O
about O
him; O
he O
felt O
himself O
going O
mad. O
Day O
broke. O
He O
saw O
three O
black O
hens O
asleep O
in O
a O
tree. O
He O
shuddered, O
horrified O
at O
this O
omen. O
Then O
he O
promised O
the O
Holy O
Virgin O
three O
chasubles O
for O
the O
church, O
and O
that O
he O
would O
go O
barefooted O
from O
the O
cemetery O
at O
Bertaux O
to O
the O
chapel O
of O
Vassonville. O
He O
entered O
Maromme O
shouting O
for O
the O
people O
of O
the O
inn, O
burst O
open O
the O
door O
with O
a O
thrust O
of O
his O
shoulder, O
made O
for O
a O
sack O
of O
oats, O
emptied O
a O
bottle O
of O
sweet O
cider O
into O
the O
manger, O
and O
again O
mounted O
his O
nag, O
whose O
feet O
struck O
fire O
as O
it O
dashed O
along. O
He O
said O
to O
himself O
that O
no O
doubt O
they O
would O
save O
her; O
the O
doctors O
would O
discover O
some O
remedy O
surely. O
He O
remembered O
all O
the O
miraculous O
cures O
he O
had O
been O
told O
about. O
Then O
she O
appeared O
to O
him O
dead. O
She O
was O
there; O
before O
his O
eyes, O
lying O
on O
her O
back O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
road. O
He O
reined O
up, O
and O
the O
hallucination O
disappeared. O
At O
Quincampoix, O
to O
give O
himself O
heart, O
he O
drank O
three O
cups O
of O
coffee O
one O
after O
the O
other. O
He O
fancied O
they O
had O
made O
a O
mistake O
in O
the O
name O
in O
writing. O
He O
looked O
for O
the O
letter O
in O
his O
pocket, O
felt O
it O
there, O
but O
did O
not O
dare O
to O
open O
it. O
At O
last O
he O
began O
to O
think O
it O
was O
all O
a O
joke; O
someone's O
spite, O
the O
jest O
of O
some O
wag; O
and O
besides, O
if O
she O
were O
dead, O
one O
would O
have O
known O
it. O
But O
no! O
There O
was O
nothing O
extraordinary O
about O
the O
country; O
the O
sky O
was O
blue, O
the O
trees O
swayed; O
a O
flock O
of O
sheep O
passed. O
He O
saw O
the O
village; O
he O
was O
seen O
coming O
bending O
forward O
upon O
his O
horse, O
belabouring O
it O
with O
great O
blows, O
the O
girths O
dripping O
with O
blood. O
When O
he O
had O
recovered O
consciousness, O
he O
fell, O
weeping, O
into O
Bovary's O
arms: O
"My O
girl! O
Emma! O
my O
child! O
tell O
me O
-- O
" O
The O
other O
replied, O
sobbing, O
"I O
don't O
know! O
I O
don't O
know! O
It's O
a O
curse!" O
The O
druggist O
separated O
them. O
"These O
horrible O
details O
are O
useless. O
I O
will O
tell O
this O
gentleman O
all O
about O
it. O
Here O
are O
the O
people O
coming. O
Dignity! O
Come O
now! O
Philosophy!" O
The O
poor O
fellow O
tried O
to O
show O
himself O
brave, O
and O
repeated O
several O
times. O
"Yes! O
courage!" O
"Oh," O
cried O
the O
old O
man, O
"so O
I O
will O
have, O
by O
God! O
I'll O
go O
along O
o' O
her O
to O
the O
end!" O
The O
bell O
began O
tolling. O
All O
was O
ready; O
they O
had O
to O
start. O
And O
seated O
in O
a O
stall O
of O
the O
choir, O
side O
by O
side, O
they O
saw O
pass O
and O
repass O
in O
front O
of O
them O
continually O
the O
three O
chanting O
choristers. O
The O
serpent-player O
was O
blowing O
with O
all O
his O
might. O
Monsieur O
Bournisien, O
in O
full O
vestments, O
was O
singing O
in O
a O
shrill O
voice. O
He O
bowed O
before O
the O
tabernacle, O
raising O
his O
hands, O
stretched O
out O
his O
arms. O
Lestiboudois O
went O
about O
the O
church O
with O
his O
whalebone O
stick. O
The O
bier O
stood O
near O
the O
lectern, O
between O
four O
rows O
of O
candles. O
Charles O
felt O
inclined O
to O
get O
up O
and O
put O
them O
out. O
Yet O
he O
tried O
to O
stir O
himself O
to O
a O
feeling O
of O
devotion, O
to O
throw O
himself O
into O
the O
hope O
of O
a O
future O
life O
in O
which O
he O
should O
see O
her O
again. O
He O
imagined O
to O
himself O
she O
had O
gone O
on O
a O
long O
journey, O
far O
away, O
for O
a O
long O
time. O
But O
when O
he O
thought O
of O
her O
lying O
there, O
and O
that O
all O
was O
over, O
that O
they O
would O
lay O
her O
in O
the O
earth, O
he O
was O
seized O
with O
a O
fierce, O
gloomy, O
despairful O
rage. O
At O
times O
he O
thought O
he O
felt O
nothing O
more, O
and O
he O
enjoyed O
this O
lull O
in O
his O
pain, O
whilst O
at O
the O
same O
time O
he O
reproached O
himself O
for O
being O
a O
wretch. O
The O
sharp O
noise O
of O
an O
iron-ferruled O
stick O
was O
heard O
on O
the O
stones, O
striking O
them O
at O
irregular O
intervals. O
It O
came O
from O
the O
end O
of O
the O
church, O
and O
stopped O
short O
at O
the O
lower O
aisles. O
A O
man O
in O
a O
coarse O
brown O
jacket O
knelt O
down O
painfully. O
It O
was O
Hippolyte, O
the O
stable-boy O
at O
the O
"Lion O
d'Or." O
He O
had O
put O
on O
his O
new O
leg. O
One O
of O
the O
choristers O
went O
round O
the O
nave O
making O
a O
collection, O
and O
the O
coppers O
chinked O
one O
after O
the O
other O
on O
the O
silver O
plate. O
"Oh, O
make O
haste! O
I O
am O
in O
pain!" O
cried O
Bovary, O
angrily O
throwing O
him O
a O
five-franc O
piece. O
The O
churchman O
thanked O
him O
with O
a O
deep O
bow. O
They O
sang, O
they O
knelt, O
they O
stood O
up; O
it O
was O
endless! O
He O
remembered O
that O
once, O
in O
the O
early O
times, O
they O
had O
been O
to O
mass O
together, O
and O
they O
had O
sat O
down O
on O
the O
other O
side, O
on O
the O
right, O
by O
the O
wall. O
The O
bell O
began O
again. O
There O
was O
a O
great O
moving O
of O
chairs; O
the O
bearers O
slipped O
their O
three O
staves O
under O
the O
coffin, O
and O
everyone O
left O
the O
church. O
Then O
Justin O
appeared O
at O
the O
door O
of O
the O
shop. O
He O
suddenly O
went O
in O
again, O
pale, O
staggering. O
People O
were O
at O
the O
windows O
to O
see O
the O
procession O
pass. O
Charles O
at O
the O
head O
walked O
erect. O
He O
affected O
a O
brave O
air, O
and O
saluted O
with O
a O
nod O
those O
who, O
coming O
out O
from O
the O
lanes O
or O
from O
their O
doors, O
stood O
amidst O
the O
crowd. O
The O
six O
men, O
three O
on O
either O
side, O
walked O
slowly, O
panting O
a O
little. O
The O
priests, O
the O
choristers, O
and O
the O
two O
choirboys O
recited O
the O
De O
profundis, O
and O
their O
voices O
echoed O
over O
the O
fields, O
rising O
and O
falling O
with O
their O
undulations. O
Sometimes O
they O
disappeared O
in O
the O
windings O
of O
the O
path; O
but O
the O
great O
silver O
cross O
rose O
always O
before O
the O
trees. O
PSALM O
CXXX. O
The O
women O
followed O
in O
black O
cloaks O
with O
turned-down O
hoods; O
each O
of O
them O
carried O
in O
her O
hands O
a O
large O
lighted O
candle, O
and O
Charles O
felt O
himself O
growing O
weaker O
at O
this O
continual O
repetition O
of O
prayers O
and O
torches, O
beneath O
this O
oppressive O
odour O
of O
wax O
and O
of O
cassocks. O
A O
fresh O
breeze O
was O
blowing; O
the O
rye O
and O
colza O
were O
sprouting, O
little O
dewdrops O
trembled O
at O
the O
roadsides O
and O
on O
the O
hawthorn O
hedges. O
All O
sorts O
of O
joyous O
sounds O
filled O
the O
air; O
the O
jolting O
of O
a O
cart O
rolling O
afar O
off O
in O
the O
ruts, O
the O
crowing O
of O
a O
cock, O
repeated O
again O
and O
again, O
or O
the O
gambling O
of O
a O
foal O
running O
away O
under O
the O
apple-trees: O
The O
pure O
sky O
was O
fretted O
with O
rosy O
clouds; O
a O
bluish O
haze O
rested O
upon O
the O
cots O
covered O
with O
iris. O
Charles O
as O
he O
passed O
recognised O
each O
courtyard. O
He O
remembered O
mornings O
like O
this, O
when, O
after O
visiting O
some O
patient, O
he O
came O
out O
from O
one O
and O
returned O
to O
her. O
The O
black O
cloth O
bestrewn O
with O
white O
beads O
blew O
up O
from O
time O
to O
time, O
laying O
bare O
the O
coffin. O
The O
tired O
bearers O
walked O
more O
slowly, O
and O
it O
advanced O
with O
constant O
jerks, O
like O
a O
boat O
that O
pitches O
with O
every O
wave. O
They O
reached O
the O
cemetery. O
The O
men O
went O
right O
down O
to O
a O
place O
in O
the O
grass O
where O
a O
grave O
was O
dug. O
They O
ranged O
themselves O
all O
round; O
and O
while O
the O
priest O
spoke, O
the O
red O
soil O
thrown O
up O
at O
the O
sides O
kept O
noiselessly O
slipping O
down O
at O
the O
corners. O
Then O
when O
the O
four O
ropes O
were O
arranged O
the O
coffin O
was O
placed O
upon O
them. O
He O
watched O
it O
descend; O
it O
seemed O
descending O
for O
ever. O
At O
last O
a O
thud O
was O
heard; O
the O
ropes O
creaked O
as O
they O
were O
drawn O
up. O
Then O
Bournisien O
took O
the O
spade O
handed O
to O
him O
by O
Lestiboudois; O
with O
his O
left O
hand O
all O
the O
time O
sprinkling O
water, O
with O
the O
right O
he O
vigorously O
threw O
in O
a O
large O
spadeful; O
and O
the O
wood O
of O
the O
coffin, O
struck O
by O
the O
pebbles, O
gave O
forth O
that O
dread O
sound O
that O
seems O
to O
us O
the O
reverberation O
of O
eternity. O
The O
ecclesiastic O
passed O
the O
holy O
water O
sprinkler O
to O
his O
neighbour. O
This O
was O
Homais. O
He O
swung O
it O
gravely, O
then O
handed O
it O
to O
Charles, O
who O
sank O
to O
his O
knees O
in O
the O
earth O
and O
threw O
in O
handfuls O
of O
it, O
crying, O
"Adieu!" O
He O
sent O
her O
kisses; O
he O
dragged O
himself O
towards O
the O
grave, O
to O
engulf O
himself O
with O
her. O
They O
led O
him O
away, O
and O
he O
soon O
grew O
calmer, O
feeling O
perhaps, O
like O
the O
others, O
a O
vague O
satisfaction O
that O
it O
was O
all O
over. O
Old O
Rouault O
on O
his O
way O
back O
began O
quietly O
smoking O
a O
pipe, O
which O
Homais O
in O
his O
innermost O
conscience O
thought O
not O
quite O
the O
thing. O
He O
also O
noticed O
that O
Monsieur O
Binet O
had O
not O
been O
present, O
and O
that O
Tuvache O
had O
"made O
off" O
after O
mass, O
and O
that O
Theodore, O
the O
notary's O
servant O
wore O
a O
blue O
coat, O
"as O
if O
one O
could O
not O
have O
got O
a O
black O
coat, O
since O
that O
is O
the O
custom, O
by O
Jove!" O
And O
to O
share O
his O
observations O
with O
others O
he O
went O
from O
group O
to O
group. O
They O
were O
deploring O
Emma's O
death, O
especially O
Lheureux, O
who O
had O
not O
failed O
to O
come O
to O
the O
funeral. O
"Poor O
little O
woman! O
What O
a O
trouble O
for O
her O
husband!" O
The O
druggist O
continued, O
"Do O
you O
know O
that O
but O
for O
me O
he O
would O
have O
committed O
some O
fatal O
attempt O
upon O
himself?" O
"Such O
a O
good O
woman! O
To O
think O
that O
I O
saw O
her O
only O
last O
Saturday O
in O
my O
shop." O
"I O
haven't O
had O
leisure," O
said O
Homais, O
"to O
prepare O
a O
few O
words O
that O
I O
would O
have O
cast O
upon O
her O
tomb." O
Charles O
on O
getting O
home O
undressed, O
and O
old O
Rouault O
put O
on O
his O
blue O
blouse. O
It O
was O
a O
new O
one, O
and O
as O
he O
had O
often O
during O
the O
journey O
wiped O
his O
eyes O
on O
the O
sleeves, O
the O
dye O
had O
stained O
his O
face, O
and O
the O
traces O
of O
tears O
made O
lines O
in O
the O
layer O
of O
dust O
that O
covered O
it. O
Madame O
Bovary O
senior O
was O
with O
them. O
All O
three O
were O
silent. O
At O
last O
the O
old O
fellow O
sighed-- O
"Do O
you O
remember, O
my O
friend, O
that O
I O
went O
to O
Tostes O
once O
when O
you O
had O
just O
lost O
your O
first O
deceased? O
I O
consoled O
you O
at O
that O
time. O
I O
thought O
of O
something O
to O
say O
then, O
but O
now O
-- O
" O
Then, O
with O
a O
loud O
groan O
that O
shook O
his O
whole O
chest, O
"Ah! O
this O
is O
the O
end O
for O
me, O
do O
you O
see! O
I O
saw O
my O
wife O
go, O
then O
my O
son, O
and O
now O
to-day O
it's O
my O
daughter." O
He O
wanted O
to O
go O
back O
at O
once O
to O
Bertaux, O
saying O
that O
he O
could O
not O
sleep O
in O
this O
house. O
He O
even O
refused O
to O
see O
his O
granddaughter. O
"No, O
no! O
It O
would O
grieve O
me O
too O
much. O
Only O
you'll O
kiss O
her O
many O
times O
for O
me. O
Good-bye! O
you're O
a O
good O
fellow! O
And O
then O
I O
shall O
never O
forget O
that," O
he O
said, O
slapping O
his O
thigh. O
"Never O
fear, O
you O
shall O
always O
have O
your O
turkey." O
But O
when O
he O
reached O
the O
top O
of O
the O
hill O
he O
turned O
back, O
as O
he O
had O
turned O
once O
before O
on O
the O
road O
of O
Saint-Victor O
when O
he O
had O
parted O
from O
her. O
The O
windows O
of O
the O
village O
were O
all O
on O
fire O
beneath O
the O
slanting O
rays O
of O
the O
sun O
sinking O
behind O
the O
field. O
He O
put O
his O
hand O
over O
his O
eyes, O
and O
saw O
in O
the O
horizon O
an O
enclosure O
of O
walls, O
where O
trees O
here O
and O
there O
formed O
black O
clusters O
between O
white O
stones; O
then O
he O
went O
on O
his O
way O
at O
a O
gentle O
trot, O
for O
his O
nag O
had O
gone O
lame. O
Despite O
their O
fatigue, O
Charles O
and O
his O
mother O
stayed O
very O
long O
that O
evening O
talking O
together. O
They O
spoke O
of O
the O
days O
of O
the O
past O
and O
of O
the O
future. O
She O
would O
come O
to O
live O
at O
Yonville; O
she O
would O
keep O
house O
for O
him; O
they O
would O
never O
part O
again. O
She O
was O
ingenious O
and O
caressing, O
rejoicing O
in O
her O
heart O
at O
gaining O
once O
more O
an O
affection O
that O
had O
wandered O
from O
her O
for O
so O
many O
years. O
Midnight O
struck. O
The O
village O
as O
usual O
was O
silent, O
and O
Charles, O
awake, O
thought O
always O
of O
her. O
Rodolphe, O
who, O
to O
distract O
himself, O
had O
been O
rambling O
about O
the O
wood O
all O
day, O
was O
sleeping O
quietly O
in O
his O
chateau, O
and O
Leon, O
down O
yonder, O
always O
slept. O
There O
was O
another O
who O
at O
that O
hour O
was O
not O
asleep. O
On O
the O
grave O
between O
the O
pine-trees O
a O
child O
was O
on O
his O
knees O
weeping, O
and O
his O
heart, O
rent O
by O
sobs, O
was O
beating O
in O
the O
shadow O
beneath O
the O
load O
of O
an O
immense O
regret, O
sweeter O
than O
the O
moon O
and O
fathomless O
as O
the O
night. O
The O
gate O
suddenly O
grated. O
It O
was O
Lestiboudois; O
he O
came O
to O
fetch O
his O
spade, O
that O
he O
had O
forgotten. O
He O
recognised O
Justin O
climbing O
over O
the O
wall, O
and O
at O
last O
knew O
who O
was O
the O
culprit O
who O
stole O
his O
potatoes. O
CHAPTER O
ELEVEN O
The O
next O
day O
Charles O
had O
the O
child O
brought O
back. O
She O
asked O
for O
her O
mamma. O
They O
told O
her O
she O
was O
away; O
that O
she O
would O
bring O
her O
back O
some O
playthings. O
Berthe O
spoke O
of O
her O
again O
several O
times, O
then O
at O
last O
thought O
no O
more O
of O
her. O
The O
child's O
gaiety O
broke O
Bovary's O
heart, O
and O
he O
had O
to O
bear O
besides O
the O
intolerable O
consolations O
of O
the O
chemist. O
Money O
troubles O
soon O
began O
again, O
Monsieur O
Lheureux O
urging O
on O
anew O
his O
friend O
Vincart, O
and O
Charles O
pledged O
himself O
for O
exorbitant O
sums; O
for O
he O
would O
never O
consent O
to O
let O
the O
smallest O
of O
the O
things O
that O
had O
belonged O
to O
HER O
be O
sold. O
His O
mother O
was O
exasperated O
with O
him; O
he O
grew O
even O
more O
angry O
than O
she O
did. O
He O
had O
altogether O
changed. O
She O
left O
the O
house. O
Then O
everyone O
began O
"taking O
advantage" O
of O
him. O
Mademoiselle O
Lempereur O
presented O
a O
bill O
for O
six O
months' O
teaching, O
although O
Emma O
had O
never O
taken O
a O
lesson O
(despite O
the O
receipted O
bill O
she O
had O
shown O
Bovary); O
it O
was O
an O
arrangement O
between O
the O
two O
women. O
The O
man O
at O
the O
circulating O
library O
demanded O
three O
years' O
subscriptions; O
Mere O
Rollet O
claimed O
the O
postage O
due O
for O
some O
twenty O
letters, O
and O
when O
Charles O
asked O
for O
an O
explanation, O
she O
had O
the O
delicacy O
to O
reply-- O
"Oh, O
I O
don't O
know. O
It O
was O
for O
her O
business O
affairs." O
With O
every O
debt O
he O
paid O
Charles O
thought O
he O
had O
come O
to O
the O
end O
of O
them. O
But O
others O
followed O
ceaselessly. O
He O
sent O
in O
accounts O
for O
professional O
attendance. O
He O
was O
shown O
the O
letters O
his O
wife O
had O
written. O
Then O
he O
had O
to O
apologise. O
Felicite O
now O
wore O
Madame O
Bovary's O
gowns; O
not O
all, O
for O
he O
had O
kept O
some O
of O
them, O
and O
he O
went O
to O
look O
at O
them O
in O
her O
dressing-room, O
locking O
himself O
up O
there; O
she O
was O
about O
her O
height, O
and O
often O
Charles, O
seeing O
her O
from O
behind, O
was O
seized O
with O
an O
illusion, O
and O
cried O
out-- O
"Oh, O
stay, O
stay!" O
But O
at O
Whitsuntide O
she O
ran O
away O
from O
Yonville, O
carried O
off O
by O
Theodore, O
stealing O
all O
that O
was O
left O
of O
the O
wardrobe. O
It O
was O
about O
this O
time O
that O
the O
widow O
Dupuis O
had O
the O
honour O
to O
inform O
him O
of O
the O
"marriage O
of O
Monsieur O
Leon O
Dupuis O
her O
son, O
notary O
at O
Yvetot, O
to O
Mademoiselle O
Leocadie O
Leboeuf O
of O
Bondeville." O
Charles, O
among O
the O
other O
congratulations O
he O
sent O
him, O
wrote O
this O
sentence-- O
"How O
glad O
my O
poor O
wife O
would O
have O
been!" O
One O
day O
when, O
wandering O
aimlessly O
about O
the O
house, O
he O
had O
gone O
up O
to O
the O
attic, O
he O
felt O
a O
pellet O
of O
fine O
paper O
under O
his O
slipper. O
He O
opened O
it O
and O
read: O
"Courage, O
Emma, O
courage. O
I O
would O
not O
bring O
misery O
into O
your O
life." O
It O
was O
Rodolphe's O
letter, O
fallen O
to O
the O
ground O
between O
the O
boxes, O
where O
it O
had O
remained, O
and O
that O
the O
wind O
from O
the O
dormer O
window O
had O
just O
blown O
towards O
the O
door. O
And O
Charles O
stood, O
motionless O
and O
staring, O
in O
the O
very O
same O
place O
where, O
long O
ago, O
Emma, O
in O
despair, O
and O
paler O
even O
than O
he, O
had O
thought O
of O
dying. O
At O
last O
he O
discovered O
a O
small O
R O
at O
the O
bottom O
of O
the O
second O
page. O
What O
did O
this O
mean? O
He O
remembered O
Rodolphe's O
attentions, O
his O
sudden, O
disappearance, O
his O
constrained O
air O
when O
they O
had O
met O
two O
or O
three O
times O
since. O
But O
the O
respectful O
tone O
of O
the O
letter O
deceived O
him. O
"Perhaps O
they O
loved O
one O
another O
platonically," O
he O
said O
to O
himself. O
Besides, O
Charles O
was O
not O
of O
those O
who O
go O
to O
the O
bottom O
of O
things; O
he O
shrank O
from O
the O
proofs, O
and O
his O
vague O
jealousy O
was O
lost O
in O
the O
immensity O
of O
his O
woe. O
Everyone, O
he O
thought, O
must O
have O
adored O
her; O
all O
men O
assuredly O
must O
have O
coveted O
her. O
She O
seemed O
but O
the O
more O
beautiful O
to O
him O
for O
this; O
he O
was O
seized O
with O
a O
lasting, O
furious O
desire O
for O
her, O
that O
inflamed O
his O
despair, O
and O
that O
was O
boundless, O
because O
it O
was O
now O
unrealisable. O
To O
please O
her, O
as O
if O
she O
were O
still O
living, O
he O
adopted O
her O
predilections, O
her O
ideas; O
he O
bought O
patent O
leather O
boots O
and O
took O
to O
wearing O
white O
cravats. O
He O
put O
cosmetics O
on O
his O
moustache, O
and, O
like O
her, O
signed O
notes O
of O
hand. O
She O
corrupted O
him O
from O
beyond O
the O
grave. O
He O
was O
obliged O
to O
sell O
his O
silver O
piece O
by O
piece; O
next O
he O
sold O
the O
drawing-room O
furniture. O
All O
the O
rooms O
were O
stripped; O
but O
the O
bedroom, O
her O
own O
room, O
remained O
as O
before. O
After O
his O
dinner O
Charles O
went O
up O
there. O
He O
pushed O
the O
round O
table O
in O
front O
of O
the O
fire, O
and O
drew O
up O
her O
armchair. O
He O
sat O
down O
opposite O
it. O
A O
candle O
burnt O
in O
one O
of O
the O
gilt O
candlesticks. O
Berthe O
by O
his O
side O
was O
painting O
prints. O
He O
suffered, O
poor O
man, O
at O
seeing O
her O
so O
badly O
dressed, O
with O
laceless O
boots, O
and O
the O
arm-holes O
of O
her O
pinafore O
torn O
down O
to O
the O
hips; O
for O
the O
charwoman O
took O
no O
care O
of O
her. O
But O
she O
was O
so O
sweet, O
so O
pretty, O
and O
her O
little O
head O
bent O
forward O
so O
gracefully, O
letting O
the O
dear O
fair O
hair O
fall O
over O
her O
rosy O
cheeks, O
that O
an O
infinite O
joy O
came O
upon O
him, O
a O
happiness O
mingled O
with O
bitterness, O
like O
those O
ill-made O
wines O
that O
taste O
of O
resin. O
He O
mended O
her O
toys, O
made O
her O
puppets O
from O
cardboard, O
or O
sewed O
up O
half-torn O
dolls. O
Then, O
if O
his O
eyes O
fell O
upon O
the O
workbox, O
a O
ribbon O
lying O
about, O
or O
even O
a O
pin O
left O
in O
a O
crack O
of O
the O
table, O
he O
began O
to O
dream, O
and O
looked O
so O
sad O
that O
she O
became O
as O
sad O
as O
he. O
No O
one O
now O
came O
to O
see O
them, O
for O
Justin O
had O
run O
away O
to O
Rouen, O
where O
he O
was O
a O
grocer's O
assistant, O
and O
the O
druggist's O
children O
saw O
less O
and O
less O
of O
the O
child, O
Monsieur O
Homais O
not O
caring, O
seeing O
the O
difference O
of O
their O
social O
position, O
to O
continue O
the O
intimacy. O
The O
blind O
man, O
whom O
he O
had O
not O
been O
able O
to O
cure O
with O
the O
pomade, O
had O
gone O
back O
to O
the O
hill O
of O
Bois-Guillaume, O
where O
he O
told O
the O
travellers O
of O
the O
vain O
attempt O
of O
the O
druggist, O
to O
such O
an O
extent, O
that O
Homais O
when O
he O
went O
to O
town O
hid O
himself O
behind O
the O
curtains O
of O
the O
"Hirondelle" O
to O
avoid O
meeting O
him. O
He O
detested O
him, O
and O
wishing, O
in O
the O
interests O
of O
his O
own O
reputation, O
to O
get O
rid O
of O
him O
at O
all O
costs, O
he O
directed O
against O
him O
a O
secret O
battery, O
that O
betrayed O
the O
depth O
of O
his O
intellect O
and O
the O
baseness O
of O
his O
vanity. O
Thus, O
for O
six O
consecutive O
months, O
one O
could O
read O
in O
the O
"Fanal O
de O
Rouen" O
editorials O
such O
as O
these-- O
"All O
who O
bend O
their O
steps O
towards O
the O
fertile O
plains O
of O
Picardy O
have, O
no O
doubt, O
remarked, O
by O
the O
Bois-Guillaume O
hill, O
a O
wretch O
suffering O
from O
a O
horrible O
facial O
wound. O
He O
importunes, O
persecutes O
one, O
and O
levies O
a O
regular O
tax O
on O
all O
travellers. O
Are O
we O
still O
living O
in O
the O
monstrous O
times O
of O
the O
Middle O
Ages, O
when O
vagabonds O
were O
permitted O
to O
display O
in O
our O
public O
places O
leprosy O
and O
scrofulas O
they O
had O
brought O
back O
from O
the O
Crusades?" O
OR-- O
"In O
spite O
of O
the O
laws O
against O
vagabondage, O
the O
approaches O
to O
our O
great O
towns O
continue O
to O
be O
infected O
by O
bands O
of O
beggars. O
Some O
are O
seen O
going O
about O
alone, O
and O
these O
are O
not, O
perhaps, O
the O
least O
dangerous. O
What O
are O
our O
ediles O
about?" O
THEN O
HOMAIS O
INVENTED O
ANECDOTES-- O
"Yesterday, O
by O
the O
Bois-Guillaume O
hill, O
a O
skittish O
horse O
-- O
" O
And O
then O
followed O
the O
story O
of O
an O
accident O
caused O
by O
the O
presence O
of O
the O
blind O
man. O
He O
managed O
so O
well O
that O
the O
fellow O
was O
locked O
up. O
But O
he O
was O
released. O
He O
began O
again, O
and O
Homais O
began O
again. O
It O
was O
a O
struggle. O
Homais O
won O
it, O
for O
his O
foe O
was O
condemned O
to O
life-long O
confinement O
in O
an O
asylum. O
This O
success O
emboldened O
him, O
and O
henceforth O
there O
was O
no O
longer O
a O
dog O
run O
over, O
a O
barn O
burnt O
down, O
a O
woman O
beaten O
in O
the O
parish, O
of O
which O
he O
did O
not O
immediately O
inform O
the O
public, O
guided O
always O
by O
the O
love O
of O
progress O
and O
the O
hate O
of O
priests. O
He O
instituted O
comparisons O
between O
the O
elementary O
and O
clerical O
schools O
to O
the O
detriment O
of O
the O
latter; O
called O
to O
mind O
the O
massacre O
of O
St. O
Bartholomew O
a O
propos O
of O
a O
grant O
of O
one O
hundred O
francs O
to O
the O
church, O
and O
denounced O
abuses, O
aired O
new O
views. O
That O
was O
his O
phrase. O
Homais O
was O
digging O
and O
delving; O
he O
was O
becoming O
dangerous. O
However, O
he O
was O
stifling O
in O
the O
narrow O
limits O
of O
journalism, O
and O
soon O
a O
book, O
a O
work O
was O
necessary O
to O
him. O
Then O
he O
composed O
"General O
Statistics O
of O
the O
Canton O
of O
Yonville, O
followed O
by O
Climatological O
Remarks." O
The O
statistics O
drove O
him O
to O
philosophy. O
He O
busied O
himself O
with O
great O
questions: O
the O
social O
problem, O
moralisation O
of O
the O
poorer O
classes, O
pisciculture, O
caoutchouc, O
railways, O
etc. O
He O
even O
began O
to O
blush O
at O
being O
a O
bourgeois. O
He O
affected O
the O
artistic O
style, O
he O
smoked. O
He O
bought O
two O
chic O
Pompadour O
statuettes O
to O
adorn O
his O
drawing-room. O
He O
by O
no O
means O
gave O
up O
his O
shop. O
On O
the O
contrary, O
he O
kept O
well O
abreast O
of O
new O
discoveries. O
He O
followed O
the O
great O
movement O
of O
chocolates; O
he O
was O
the O
first O
to O
introduce O
"cocoa" O
and O
"revalenta" O
into O
the O
Seine-Inferieure. O
He O
was O
enthusiastic O
about O
the O
hydro-electric O
Pulvermacher O
chains; O
he O
wore O
one O
himself, O
and O
when O
at O
night O
he O
took O
off O
his O
flannel O
vest, O
Madame O
Homais O
stood O
quite O
dazzled O
before O
the O
golden O
spiral O
beneath O
which O
he O
was O
hidden, O
and O
felt O
her O
ardour O
redouble O
for O
this O
man O
more O
bandaged O
than O
a O
Scythian, O
and O
splendid O
as O
one O
of O
the O
Magi. O
He O
had O
fine O
ideas O
about O
Emma's O
tomb. O
First O
he O
proposed O
a O
broken O
column O
with O
some O
drapery, O
next O
a O
pyramid, O
then O
a O
Temple O
of O
Vesta, O
a O
sort O
of O
rotunda, O
or O
else O
a O
"mass O
of O
ruins." O
And O
in O
all O
his O
plans O
Homais O
always O
stuck O
to O
the O
weeping O
willow, O
which O
he O
looked O
upon O
as O
the O
indispensable O
symbol O
of O
sorrow. O
Charles O
and O
he O
made O
a O
journey O
to O
Rouen O
together O
to O
look O
at O
some O
tombs O
at O
a O
funeral O
furnisher's, O
accompanied O
by O
an O
artist, O
one O
Vaufrylard, O
a O
friend O
of O
Bridoux's, O
who O
made O
puns O
all O
the O
time. O
At O
last, O
after O
having O
examined O
some O
hundred O
designs, O
having O
ordered O
an O
estimate O
and O
made O
another O
journey O
to O
Rouen, O
Charles O
decided O
in O
favour O
of O
a O
mausoleum, O
which O
on O
the O
two O
principal O
sides O
was O
to O
have O
a O
"spirit O
bearing O
an O
extinguished O
torch." O
As O
to O
the O
inscription, O
Homais O
could O
think O
of O
nothing O
so O
fine O
as O
Sta O
viator, O
and O
he O
got O
no O
further; O
he O
racked O
his O
brain, O
he O
constantly O
repeated O
Sta O
viator. O
At O
last O
he O
hit O
upon O
Amabilen O
conjugem O
calcas, O
which O
was O
adopted. O
REST O
TRAVELER. O
TREAD O
UPON O
A O
LOVING O
WIFE. O
A O
strange O
thing O
was O
that O
Bovary, O
while O
continually O
thinking O
of O
Emma, O
was O
forgetting O
her. O
He O
grew O
desperate O
as O
he O
felt O
this O
image O
fading O
from O
his O
memory O
in O
spite O
of O
all O
efforts O
to O
retain O
it. O
Yet O
every O
night O
he O
dreamt O
of O
her; O
it O
was O
always O
the O
same O
dream. O
He O
drew O
near O
her, O
but O
when O
he O
was O
about O
to O
clasp O
her O
she O
fell O
into O
decay O
in O
his O
arms. O
For O
a O
week O
he O
was O
seen O
going O
to O
church O
in O
the O
evening. O
Monsieur O
Bournisien O
even O
paid O
him O
two O
or O
three O
visits, O
then O
gave O
him O
up. O
Moreover, O
the O
old O
fellow O
was O
growing O
intolerant, O
fanatic, O
said O
Homais. O
He O
thundered O
against O
the O
spirit O
of O
the O
age, O
and O
never O
failed, O
every O
other O
week, O
in O
his O
sermon, O
to O
recount O
the O
death O
agony O
of O
Voltaire, O
who O
died O
devouring O
his O
excrements, O
as O
everyone O
knows. O
In O
spite O
of O
the O
economy O
with O
which O
Bovary O
lived, O
he O
was O
far O
from O
being O
able O
to O
pay O
off O
his O
old O
debts. O
Lheureux O
refused O
to O
renew O
any O
more O
bills. O
A O
distraint O
became O
imminent. O
Then O
he O
appealed O
to O
his O
mother, O
who O
consented O
to O
let O
him O
take O
a O
mortgage O
on O
her O
property, O
but O
with O
a O
great O
many O
recriminations O
against O
Emma; O
and O
in O
return O
for O
her O
sacrifice O
she O
asked O
for O
a O
shawl O
that O
had O
escaped O
the O
depredations O
of O
Felicite. O
Charles O
refused O
to O
give O
it O
her; O
they O
quarrelled. O
She O
made O
the O
first O
overtures O
of O
reconciliation O
by O
offering O
to O
have O
the O
little O
girl, O
who O
could O
help O
her O
in O
the O
house, O
to O
live O
with O
her. O
Charles O
consented O
to O
this, O
but O
when O
the O
time O
for O
parting O
came, O
all O
his O
courage O
failed O
him. O
Then O
there O
was O
a O
final, O
complete O
rupture. O
As O
his O
affections O
vanished, O
he O
clung O
more O
closely O
to O
the O
love O
of O
his O
child. O
She O
made O
him O
anxious, O
however, O
for O
she O
coughed O
sometimes, O
and O
had O
red O
spots O
on O
her O
cheeks. O
Opposite O
his O
house, O
flourishing O
and O
merry, O
was O
the O
family O
of O
the O
chemist, O
with O
whom O
everything O
was O
prospering. O
Napoleon O
helped O
him O
in O
the O
laboratory, O
Athalie O
embroidered O
him O
a O
skullcap, O
Irma O
cut O
out O
rounds O
of O
paper O
to O
cover O
the O
preserves, O
and O
Franklin O
recited O
Pythagoras' O
table O
in O
a O
breath. O
He O
was O
the O
happiest O
of O
fathers, O
the O
most O
fortunate O
of O
men. O
Not O
so! O
A O
secret O
ambition O
devoured O
him. O
Homais O
hankered O
after O
the O
cross O
of O
the O
Legion O
of O
Honour. O
He O
had O
plenty O
of O
claims O
to O
it. O
"First, O
having O
at O
the O
time O
of O
the O
cholera O
distinguished O
myself O
by O
a O
boundless O
devotion; O
second, O
by O
having O
published, O
at O
my O
expense, O
various O
works O
of O
public O
utility, O
such O
as" O
(and O
he O
recalled O
his O
pamphlet O
entitled, O
"Cider, O
its O
manufacture O
and O
effects," O
besides O
observation O
on O
the O
lanigerous O
plant-louse, O
sent O
to O
the O
Academy; O
his O
volume O
of O
statistics, O
and O
down O
to O
his O
pharmaceutical O
thesis); O
"without O
counting O
that O
I O
am O
a O
member O
of O
several O
learned O
societies" O
(he O
was O
member O
of O
a O
single O
one). O
"In O
short!" O
he O
cried, O
making O
a O
pirouette, O
"if O
it O
were O
only O
for O
distinguishing O
myself O
at O
fires!" O
Then O
Homais O
inclined O
towards O
the O
Government. O
He O
secretly O
did O
the O
prefect O
great O
service O
during O
the O
elections. O
He O
sold O
himself-- O
in O
a O
word, O
prostituted O
himself. O
He O
even O
addressed O
a O
petition O
to O
the O
sovereign O
in O
which O
he O
implored O
him O
to O
"do O
him O
justice"; O
he O
called O
him O
"our O
good O
king," O
and O
compared O
him O
to O
Henri O
IV. O
And O
every O
morning O
the O
druggist O
rushed O
for O
the O
paper O
to O
see O
if O
his O
nomination O
were O
in O
it. O
It O
was O
never O
there. O
At O
last, O
unable O
to O
bear O
it O
any O
longer, O
he O
had O
a O
grass O
plot O
in O
his O
garden O
designed O
to O
represent O
the O
Star O
of O
the O
Cross O
of O
Honour O
with O
two O
little O
strips O
of O
grass O
running O
from O
the O
top O
to O
imitate O
the O
ribband. O
He O
walked O
round O
it O
with O
folded O
arms, O
meditating O
on O
the O
folly O
of O
the O
Government O
and O
the O
ingratitude O
of O
men. O
From O
respect, O
or O
from O
a O
sort O
of O
sensuality O
that O
made O
him O
carry O
on O
his O
investigations O
slowly, O
Charles O
had O
not O
yet O
opened O
the O
secret O
drawer O
of O
a O
rosewood O
desk O
which O
Emma O
had O
generally O
used. O
One O
day, O
however, O
he O
sat O
down O
before O
it, O
turned O
the O
key, O
and O
pressed O
the O
spring. O
All O
Leon's O
letters O
were O
there. O
There O
could O
be O
no O
doubt O
this O
time. O
He O
devoured O
them O
to O
the O
very O
last, O
ransacked O
every O
corner, O
all O
the O
furniture, O
all O
the O
drawers, O
behind O
the O
walls, O
sobbing, O
crying O
aloud, O
distraught, O
mad. O
He O
found O
a O
box O
and O
broke O
it O
open O
with O
a O
kick. O
Rodolphe's O
portrait O
flew O
full O
in O
his O
face O
in O
the O
midst O
of O
the O
overturned O
love-letters. O
People O
wondered O
at O
his O
despondency. O
He O
never O
went O
out, O
saw O
no O
one, O
refused O
even O
to O
visit O
his O
patients. O
Then O
they O
said O
"he O
shut O
himself O
up O
to O
drink." O
Sometimes, O
however, O
some O
curious O
person O
climbed O
on O
to O
the O
garden O
hedge, O
and O
saw O
with O
amazement O
this O
long-bearded, O
shabbily O
clothed, O
wild O
man, O
who O
wept O
aloud O
as O
he O
walked O
up O
and O
down. O
In O
the O
evening O
in O
summer O
he O
took O
his O
little O
girl O
with O
him O
and O
led O
her O
to O
the O
cemetery. O
They O
came O
back O
at O
nightfall, O
when O
the O
only O
light O
left O
in O
the O
Place O
was O
that O
in O
Binet's O
window. O
The O
voluptuousness O
of O
his O
grief O
was, O
however, O
incomplete, O
for O
he O
had O
no O
one O
near O
him O
to O
share O
it, O
and O
he O
paid O
visits O
to O
Madame O
Lefrancois O
to O
be O
able O
to O
speak O
of O
her. O
But O
the O
landlady O
only O
listened O
with O
half O
an O
ear, O
having O
troubles O
like O
himself. O
For O
Lheureux O
had O
at O
last O
established O
the O
"Favorites O
du O
Commerce," O
and O
Hivert, O
who O
enjoyed O
a O
great O
reputation O
for O
doing O
errands, O
insisted O
on O
a O
rise O
of O
wages, O
and O
was O
threatening O
to O
go O
over O
"to O
the O
opposition O
shop." O
One O
day O
when O
he O
had O
gone O
to O
the O
market O
at O
Argueil O
to O
sell O
his O
horse-- O
his O
last O
resource-- O
he O
met O
Rodolphe. O
They O
both O
turned O
pale O
when O
they O
caught O
sight O
of O
one O
another. O
Rodolphe, O
who O
had O
only O
sent O
his O
card, O
first O
stammered O
some O
apologies, O
then O
grew O
bolder, O
and O
even O
pushed O
his O
assurance O
(it O
was O
in O
the O
month O
of O
August O
and O
very O
hot) O
to O
the O
length O
of O
inviting O
him O
to O
have O
a O
bottle O
of O
beer O
at O
the O
public-house. O
Leaning O
on O
the O
table O
opposite O
him, O
he O
chewed O
his O
cigar O
as O
he O
talked, O
and O
Charles O
was O
lost O
in O
reverie O
at O
this O
face O
that O
she O
had O
loved. O
He O
seemed O
to O
see O
again O
something O
of O
her O
in O
it. O
It O
was O
a O
marvel O
to O
him. O
He O
would O
have O
liked O
to O
have O
been O
this O
man. O
The O
other O
went O
on O
talking O
agriculture, O
cattle, O
pasturage, O
filling O
out O
with O
banal O
phrases O
all O
the O
gaps O
where O
an O
allusion O
might O
slip O
in. O
Charles O
was O
not O
listening O
to O
him; O
Rodolphe O
noticed O
it, O
and O
he O
followed O
the O
succession O
of O
memories O
that O
crossed O
his O
face. O
This O
gradually O
grew O
redder; O
the O
nostrils O
throbbed O
fast, O
the O
lips O
quivered. O
There O
was O
at O
last O
a O
moment O
when O
Charles, O
full O
of O
a O
sombre O
fury, O
fixed O
his O
eyes O
on O
Rodolphe, O
who, O
in O
something O
of O
fear, O
stopped O
talking. O
But O
soon O
the O
same O
look O
of O
weary O
lassitude O
came O
back O
to O
his O
face. O
"I O
don't O
blame O
you," O
he O
said. O
Rodolphe O
was O
dumb. O
And O
Charles, O
his O
head O
in O
his O
hands, O
went O
on O
in O
a O
broken O
voice, O
and O
with O
the O
resigned O
accent O
of O
infinite O
sorrow-- O
"No, O
I O
don't O
blame O
you O
now." O
He O
even O
added O
a O
fine O
phrase, O
the O
only O
one O
he O
ever O
made-- O
"It O
is O
the O
fault O
of O
fatality!" O
Rodolphe, O
who O
had O
managed O
the O
fatality, O
thought O
the O
remark O
very O
offhand O
from O
a O
man O
in O
his O
position, O
comic O
even, O
and O
a O
little O
mean. O
The O
next O
day O
Charles O
went O
to O
sit O
down O
on O
the O
seat O
in O
the O
arbour. O
Rays O
of O
light O
were O
straying O
through O
the O
trellis, O
the O
vine O
leaves O
threw O
their O
shadows O
on O
the O
sand, O
the O
jasmines O
perfumed O
the O
air, O
the O
heavens O
were O
blue, O
Spanish O
flies O
buzzed O
round O
the O
lilies O
in O
bloom, O
and O
Charles O
was O
suffocating O
like O
a O
youth O
beneath O
the O
vague O
love O
influences O
that O
filled O
his O
aching O
heart. O
At O
seven O
o'clock O
little O
Berthe, O
who O
had O
not O
seen O
him O
all O
the O
afternoon, O
went O
to O
fetch O
him O
to O
dinner. O
His O
head O
was O
thrown O
back O
against O
the O
wall, O
his O
eyes O
closed, O
his O
mouth O
open, O
and O
in O
his O
hand O
was O
a O
long O
tress O
of O
black O
hair. O
"Come O
along, O
papa," O
she O
said. O
And O
thinking O
he O
wanted O
to O
play; O
she O
pushed O
him O
gently. O
He O
fell O
to O
the O
ground. O
He O
was O
dead. O
Thirty-six O
hours O
after, O
at O
the O
druggist's O
request, O
Monsieur O
Canivet O
came O
thither. O
He O
made O
a O
post-mortem O
and O
found O
nothing. O
When O
everything O
had O
been O
sold, O
twelve O
francs O
seventy-five O
centimes O
remained, O
that O
served O
to O
pay O
for O
Mademoiselle O
Bovary's O
going O
to O
her O
grandmother. O
The O
good O
woman O
died O
the O
same O
year; O
old O
Rouault O
was O
paralysed, O
and O
it O
was O
an O
aunt O
who O
took O
charge O
of O
her. O
She O
is O
poor, O
and O
sends O
her O
to O
a O
cotton-factory O
to O
earn O
a O
living. O
Since O
Bovary's O
death O
three O
doctors O
have O
followed O
one O
another O
at O
Yonville O
without O
any O
success, O
so O
severely O
did O
Homais O
attack O
them. O
He O
has O
an O
enormous O
practice; O
the O
authorities O
treat O
him O
with O
consideration, O
and O
public O
opinion O
protects O
him. O
He O
has O
just O
received O
the O
cross O
of O
the O
Legion O
of O
Honour. O

CHAPTER O
I O
"TOM!" Quotation
No O
answer. O
"TOM!" Quotation
No O
answer. O
"What's Quotation
gone Quotation
with Quotation
that Quotation
boy, Quotation
 Quotation
I Quotation
wonder? Quotation
You Quotation
TOM!" Quotation
No O
answer. O
The Entity
old Entity
lady Entity
pulled O
her O
spectacles O
down O
and O
looked O
over O
them O
about O
the O
room; O
then O
she O
put O
them O
up O
and O
looked O
out O
under O
them. O
She O
seldom O
or O
never O
looked O
THROUGH O
them O
for O
so O
small O
a O
thing O
as O
a O
boy; O
they O
were O
her O
state O
pair, O
the O
pride O
of O
her O
heart, O
and O
were O
built O
for O
"style," O
not O
service-- O
she O
could O
have O
seen O
through O
a O
pair O
of O
stove-lids O
just O
as O
well. O
She Entity
looked O
perplexed O
for O
a O
moment, O
and O
then O
said, Cue
not O
fiercely, O
but O
still O
loud O
enough O
for O
the O
furniture O
to O
hear: O
"Well, Quotation
I Quotation
lay Quotation
if Quotation
I Quotation
get Quotation
hold Quotation
of Quotation
you Quotation
I'll Quotation
-- Quotation
" Quotation
She O
did O
not O
finish, O
for O
by O
this O
time O
she O
was O
bending O
down O
and O
punching O
under O
the O
bed O
with O
the O
broom, O
and O
so O
she O
needed O
breath O
to O
punctuate O
the O
punches O
with. O
She Entity
resurrected O
nothing O
but O
the O
cat. O
"I Quotation
never Quotation
did Quotation
see Quotation
the Quotation
beat Quotation
of Quotation
that Quotation
boy!" Quotation
She O
went O
to O
the O
open O
door O
and O
stood O
in O
it O
and O
looked O
out O
among O
the O
tomato O
vines O
and O
"jimpson" O
weeds O
that O
constituted O
the O
garden. O
No O
Tom. Entity
So O
she Entity
lifted O
up O
her O
voice O
at O
an O
angle O
calculated O
for O
distance O
and O
shouted: Cue
"Y-o-u-u Quotation
TOM!" Quotation
There O
was O
a O
slight O
noise O
behind O
her O
and O
she Entity
turned O
just O
in O
time O
to O
seize O
a Entity
small Entity
boy Entity
by O
the O
slack O
of O
his O
roundabout O
and O
arrest O
his O
flight. O
"There! Quotation
I Quotation
might Quotation
'a' Quotation
thought Quotation
of Quotation
that Quotation
closet. Quotation
What Quotation
you Quotation
been Quotation
doing Quotation
in Quotation
there?" Quotation
"Nothing." Quotation
"Nothing! Quotation
Look Quotation
at Quotation
your Quotation
hands. Quotation
And Quotation
look Quotation
at Quotation
your Quotation
mouth. Quotation
What Quotation
IS Quotation
that Quotation
truck?" Quotation
"I Quotation
don't Quotation
know, Quotation
aunt." Quotation
"Well, Quotation
I Quotation
know. Quotation
It's Quotation
jam-- Quotation
that's Quotation
what Quotation
it Quotation
is. Quotation
Forty Quotation
times Quotation
I've Quotation
said Quotation
if Quotation
you Quotation
didn't Quotation
let Quotation
that Quotation
jam Quotation
alone Quotation
I'd Quotation
skin Quotation
you. Quotation
Hand Quotation
me Quotation
that Quotation
switch." Quotation
The O
switch O
hovered O
in O
the O
air-- O
the O
peril O
was O
desperate-- O
"My! Quotation
Look Quotation
behind Quotation
you, Quotation
aunt!" Quotation
The O
old O
lady O
whirled O
round, O
and O
snatched O
her O
skirts O
out O
of O
danger. O
The O
lad O
fled O
on O
the O
instant, O
scrambled O
up O
the O
high O
board-fence, O
and O
disappeared O
over O
it. O
His Entity
aunt Entity
Polly Entity
stood O
surprised O
a O
moment, O
and O
then O
broke O
into O
a O
gentle O
laugh. O
"Hang Quotation
the Quotation

Tom O
did O
play O
hookey, O

he O
had O
a O
very O
good O
time. O
He O
got O
back O
home O
barely O
in O
season O
to O
help O
Jim, O
the O
small O
colored O
boy, O
saw O
next-day's O
wood O
and O
split O
the O
kindlings O
before O
supper-- O
at O
least O
he O
was O
there O
in O
time O
to O
tell O

adventures O
to O
Jim O

did O
three-fourths O

Aunt Entity

asked Cue

full Quotation

very Quotation
deep-- Quotation
for O
she O
wanted O
to O
trap O
him O
into O
damaging O

Like O
many O

it O

her O
pet O
vanity O
to O
believe O
she O
was O
endowed O
with O
a O
talent O
for O
dark O

she O
loved O

-- O
a O
touch O
of O
uncomfortable O
suspicion. O
He O
searched O
Aunt Entity
Polly's Entity
face, O
but O
it O
told O
him O
nothing. O
So O
he Entity
said: Cue
"No'm-- Quotation
well, Quotation
not Quotation
very Quotation
much." Quotation
The Entity
old Entity
lady Entity
reached O
out O
her O
hand O
and O
felt O
Tom's Entity
shirt, O
and O
said: Cue
"But Quotation
you Quotation
ain't Quotation
too Quotation
warm Quotation
now, Quotation
though." Quotation
And O
it O
flattered O
her O
to O
reflect O
that O
she O
had O
discovered O
that O
the O
shirt O
was O
dry O
without O
anybody O
knowing O
that O
that O
was O
what O
she O
had O
in O
her O
mind. O
But O
in O
spite O
of O
her, O
Tom O
knew O
where O
the O
wind O
lay, O
now. O
So O
he Entity
forestalled O
what O
might O
be O
the O
next O
move: O
"Some Quotation
of Quotation
us Quotation
pumped Quotation
on Quotation
our Quotation
heads-- Quotation
mine's Quotation
damp Quotation
yet. Quotation
See?" Quotation
Aunt Entity
Polly Entity
was O
vexed O
to O
think O
she O
had O
overlooked O
that O
bit O
of O
circumstantial O
evidence, O
and O
missed O
a O
trick. O
Then O
she Entity
had O
a O
new O
inspiration: O
"Tom, Quotation
you Quotation
didn't Quotation
have Quotation
to Quotation
undo Quotation
your Quotation
shirt Quotation
collar Quotation
where Quotation
I Quotation
sewed Quotation
it, Quotation
to Quotation
pump Quotation
on Quotation
your Quotation
head, Quotation
did Quotation
you? Quotation
Unbutton Quotation
your Quotation
jacket!" Quotation
The O
trouble O
vanished O
out O
of O
Tom's O
face. O
He O
opened O
his O
jacket. O
His Entity
shirt O
collar O
was O
securely O
sewed. O
"Bother! Quotation
Well, Quotation
go Quotation
'long Quotation
with Quotation
you. Quotation
I'd Quotation
made Quotation
sure Quotation
you'd Quotation
played Quotation
hookey Quotation
and Quotation
been Quotation
a-swimming. Quotation
But Quotation
I Quotation
forgive Quotation
ye, Quotation
Tom. Quotation
I Quotation
reckon Quotation
you're Quotation
a Quotation
kind Quotation
of Quotation
a Quotation
singed Quotation
cat, Quotation
as Quotation
the Quotation
saying Quotation
is-- Quotation
better'n Quotation
you Quotation
look. Quotation
THIS Quotation
time." Quotation
She Entity
was O
half O
sorry O
her O
sagacity O
had O
miscarried, O
and O
half O
glad O
that O
Tom O
had O
stumbled O
into O
obedient O
conduct O
for O
once. O
But O
Sidney Entity
said: Cue
"Well, Quotation
now, Quotation
if Quotation
I Quotation
didn't Quotation
think Quotation
you Quotation
sewed Quotation
his Quotation
collar Quotation
with Quotation
white Quotation
thread, Quotation
but Quotation
it's Quotation
black." Quotation
"Why, Quotation
I Quotation
did Quotation
sew Quotation
it Quotation
with Quotation
white! Quotation
Tom!" Quotation
But O
Tom Entity
did O
not O
wait O
for O
the O
rest. O
As O
he O
went O
out O
at O
the O
door O
he Entity
said: Cue
"Siddy, Quotation
I'll Quotation
lick Quotation
you Quotation
for Quotation
that." Quotation
In O
a O
safe O
place O
Tom O
examined O
two O
large O
needles O
which O
were O
thrust O
into O
the O
lapels O
of O
his O
jacket, O
and O
had O
thread O
bound O
about O
them-- O
one O
needle O
carried O
white O
thread O
and O
the O
other O
black. O
He Entity
said: Cue
"She'd Quotation
never Quotation
noticed Quotation
if Quotation
it Quotation
hadn't Quotation
been Quotation
for Quotation
Sid. Quotation
Confound Quotation
it! Quotation
sometimes Quotation
she Quotation
sews Quotation
it Quotation
with Quotation
white, Quotation
and Quotation
sometimes Quotation
she Quotation
sews Quotation
it Quotation
with Quotation
black. Quotation
I Quotation
wish Quotation
to Quotation
geeminy Quotation
she'd Quotation
stick Quotation
to Quotation
one Quotation
or Quotation
t'other Quotation
-- Quotation
I Quotation
can't Quotation
keep Quotation
the Quotation
run Quotation
of Quotation
'em. Quotation
But Quotation
I Quotation
bet Quotation
you Quotation
I'll Quotation
lam Quotation
Sid Quotation
for Quotation
that. Quotation
I'll Quotation
learn Quotation
him!" Quotation
He O
was O
not O
the O
Model O
Boy O
of O
the O
village. O
He O
knew O
the O
model O
boy O
very O
well O
though-- O
and O
loathed O
him. O
Within O
two O
minutes, O
or O
even O
less, O
he O
had O
forgotten O
all O
his O
troubles. O
Not O
because O
his O
troubles O
were O
one O
whit O
less O
heavy O
and O
bitter O
to O
him O
than O
a O
man's O
are O
to O
a O
man, O
but O
because O
a O
new O
and O
powerful O
interest O
bore O
them O
down O
and O
drove O
them O
out O
of O
his O
mind O
for O
the O
time-- O
just O
as O
men's O
misfortunes O
are O
forgotten O
in O
the O
excitement O
of O
new O
enterprises. O
This O
new O
interest O
was O
a O
valued O
novelty O
in O
whistling, O
which O
he O
had O
just O
acquired O
from O
a O
negro, O
and O
he O
was O
suffering O
to O
practise O
it O
undisturbed. O
It O
consisted O
in O
a O
peculiar O
bird-like O
turn, O
a O
sort O
of O
liquid O
warble, O
produced O
by O
touching O
the O
tongue O
to O
the O
roof O
of O
the O
mouth O
at O
short O
intervals O
in O
the O
midst O
of O
the O
music-- O
the O
reader O
probably O
remembers O
how O
to O
do O
it, O
if O
he O
has O
ever O
been O
a O
boy. O
Diligence O
and O
attention O
soon O
gave O
him O
the O
knack O
of O
it, O
and O
he O
strode O
down O
the O
street O
with O
his O
mouth O
full O
of O
harmony O
and O
his O
soul O
full O
of O
gratitude. O
He O
felt O
much O
as O
an O
astronomer O
feels O
who O
has O
discovered O
a O
new O
planet-- O
no O
doubt, O
as O
far O
as O
strong, O
deep, O
unalloyed O
pleasure O
is O
concerned, O
the O
advantage O
was O
with O
the O
boy, O
not O
the O
astronomer. O
The O
summer O
evenings O
were O
long. O
It O
was O
not O
dark, O
yet. O
Presently O
Tom O
checked O
his O
whistle. O
A O
stranger O
was O
before O
him O
-- O
a O
boy O
a O
shade O
larger O
than O
himself. O
A O
new-comer O
of O
any O
age O
or O
either O
sex O
was O
an O
impressive O
curiosity O
in O
the O
poor O
little O
shabby O
village O
of O
St. O
Petersburg. O
This O
boy O
was O
well O
dressed, O
too-- O
well O
dressed O
on O
a O
week-day. O
This O
was O
simply O
astounding. O
His O
cap O
was O
a O
dainty O
thing, O
his O
close-buttoned O
blue O
cloth O
roundabout O
was O
new O
and O
natty, O
and O
so O
were O
his O
pantaloons. O
He O
had O
shoes O
on-- O
and O
it O
was O
only O
Friday. O
He O
even O
wore O
a O
necktie, O
a O
bright O
bit O
of O
ribbon. O
He Entity
had O
a O
citified O
air O
about O
him O
that O
ate O
into O
Tom's O
vitals. O
The O
more O
Tom O
stared O
at O
the O
splendid O
marvel, O
the O
higher O
he O
turned O
up O
his O
nose O
at O
his O
finery O
and O
the O
shabbier O
and O
shabbier O
his O
own O
outfit O
seemed O
to O
him O
to O
grow. O
Neither O
boy O
spoke. O
If O
one O
moved, O
the O
other O
moved-- O
but O
only O
sidewise, O
in O
a O
circle; O
they O
kept O
face O
to O
face O
and O
eye O
to O
eye O
all O
the O
time. O
Finally O
Tom Entity
said: Cue
"I Quotation
can Quotation
lick Quotation
you!" Quotation
"I'd Quotation
like Quotation
to Quotation
see Quotation
you Quotation
try Quotation
it." Quotation
"Well, Quotation
I Quotation
can Quotation
do Quotation
it." Quotation
"No Quotation
you Quotation
can't, Quotation
either." Quotation
"Yes Quotation
I Quotation
can." Quotation
"No Quotation
you Quotation
can't." Quotation
"I Quotation
can." Quotation
"You Quotation
can't." Quotation
"Can!" Quotation
"Can't!" Quotation
An O
uncomfortable O
pause. O
Then O
Tom Entity
said: Cue
"What's Quotation
your Quotation
name?" Quotation
"'Tisn't Quotation
any Quotation
of Quotation
your Quotation
business, Quotation
maybe." Quotation
"Well Quotation
I Quotation
'low Quotation
I'll Quotation
MAKE Quotation
it Quotation
my Quotation
business." Quotation
"Well Quotation
why Quotation
don't Quotation
you?" Quotation
"If Quotation
you Quotation
say Quotation
much, Quotation
I Quotation
will." Quotation
"Much-- Quotation
much-- Quotation
MUCH. Quotation
There Quotation
now." Quotation
"Oh, Quotation
you Quotation
think Quotation
you're Quotation
mighty Quotation
smart, Quotation
DON'T Quotation
you? Quotation
I Quotation
could Quotation
lick Quotation
you Quotation
with Quotation
one Quotation
hand Quotation
tied Quotation
behind Quotation
me, Quotation
if Quotation
I Quotation
wanted Quotation
to." Quotation
"Well Quotation
why Quotation
don't Quotation
you Quotation
DO Quotation
it? Quotation
You Quotation
SAY Quotation
you Quotation
can Quotation
do Quotation
it." Quotation
"Well Quotation
I Quotation
WILL, Quotation
if Quotation
you Quotation
fool Quotation
with Quotation
me." Quotation
"Oh Quotation
yes-- Quotation
I've Quotation
seen Quotation
whole Quotation
families Quotation
in Quotation
the Quotation
same Quotation
fix." Quotation
"Smarty! Quotation
You Quotation
think Quotation
you're Quotation
SOME, Quotation
now, Quotation
DON'T Quotation
you? Quotation
Oh, Quotation
what Quotation
a Quotation
hat!" Quotation
"You Quotation
can Quotation
lump Quotation
that Quotation
hat Quotation
if Quotation
you Quotation
don't Quotation
like Quotation
it. Quotation
I Quotation
dare Quotation
you Quotation
to Quotation
knock Quotation
it Quotation
off-- Quotation
and Quotation
anybody Quotation
that'll Quotation
take Quotation
a Quotation
dare Quotation
will Quotation
suck Quotation
eggs." Quotation
"You're Quotation
a Quotation
liar!" Quotation
"You're Quotation
another." Quotation
"You're Quotation
a Quotation
fighting Quotation
liar Quotation
and Quotation
dasn't Quotation
take Quotation
it Quotation
up." Quotation
"Aw-- Quotation
take Quotation
a Quotation
walk!" Quotation
"Say-- Quotation
if Quotation
you Quotation
give Quotation
me Quotation
much Quotation
more Quotation
of Quotation
your Quotation
sass Quotation
I'll Quotation
take Quotation
and Quotation
bounce Quotation
a Quotation
rock Quotation
off'n Quotation
your Quotation
head." Quotation
"Oh, Quotation
of Quotation
COURSE Quotation
you Quotation
will." Quotation
"Well Quotation
I Quotation
WILL." Quotation
"Well Quotation
why Quotation
don't Quotation
you Quotation
DO Quotation
it Quotation
then? Quotation
What Quotation
do Quotation
you Quotation
keep Quotation
SAYING Quotation
you Quotation
will Quotation
for? Quotation
Why Quotation
don't Quotation
you Quotation
DO Quotation
it? Quotation
It's Quotation
because Quotation
you're Quotation
afraid." Quotation
"I Quotation
AIN'T Quotation
afraid." Quotation
"You Quotation
are." Quotation
"I Quotation
ain't." Quotation
"You Quotation
are." Quotation
Another O
pause, O
and O
more O
eying O
and O
sidling O
around O
each O
other. O
Presently O
they O
were O
shoulder O
to O
shoulder. O
Tom Entity
said: Cue
"Get Quotation
away Quotation
from Quotation
here!" Quotation
"Go Quotation
away Quotation
yourself!" Quotation
"I Quotation
won't." Quotation
"I Quotation
won't Quotation
either." Quotation
So O
they O
stood, O
each O
with O
a O
foot O
placed O
at O
an O
angle O
as O
a O
brace, O
and O
both O
shoving O
with O
might O
and O
main, O
and O
glowering O
at O
each O
other O
with O
hate. O
But O
neither O
could O
get O
an O
advantage. O
After O
struggling O
till O
both O
were O
hot O
and O
flushed, O
each O
relaxed O
his O
strain O
with O
watchful O
caution, O
and O
Tom Entity
said: Cue
"You're Quotation
a Quotation
coward Quotation
and Quotation
a Quotation
pup. Quotation
I'll Quotation
tell Quotation
my Quotation
big Quotation
brother Quotation
on Quotation
you, Quotation
and Quotation
he Quotation
can Quotation
thrash Quotation
you Quotation
with Quotation
his Quotation
little Quotation
finger, Quotation
and Quotation
I'll Quotation
make Quotation
him Quotation
do Quotation
it, Quotation
too." Quotation
"What Quotation
do Quotation
I Quotation
care Quotation
for Quotation
your Quotation
big Quotation
brother? Quotation
I've Quotation
got Quotation
a Quotation
brother Quotation
that's Quotation
bigger Quotation
than Quotation
he Quotation
is-- Quotation
and Quotation
what's Quotation
more, Quotation
he Quotation
can Quotation
throw Quotation
him Quotation
over Quotation
that Quotation
fence, Quotation
too." Quotation
[Both O
brothers O
were O
imaginary.] O
"That's Quotation
a Quotation
lie." Quotation
"YOUR Quotation
saying Quotation
so Quotation
don't Quotation
make Quotation
it Quotation
so." Quotation
Tom Entity
drew O
a O
line O
in O
the O
dust O
with O
his O
big O
toe, O
and O
said: Cue
"I Quotation
dare Quotation
you Quotation
to Quotation
step Quotation
over Quotation
that, Quotation
and Quotation
I'll Quotation
lick Quotation
you Quotation
till Quotation
you Quotation
can't Quotation
stand Quotation
up. Quotation
Anybody Quotation
that'll Quotation
take Quotation
a Quotation
dare Quotation
will Quotation
steal Quotation
sheep." Quotation
The Entity
new Entity
boy Entity
stepped O
over O
promptly, O
and O
said: Cue
"Now Quotation
you Quotation
said Quotation
you'd Quotation
do Quotation
it, Quotation
now Quotation
let's Quotation
see Quotation
you Quotation
do Quotation
it." Quotation
"Don't Quotation
you Quotation
crowd Quotation
me Quotation
now; Quotation
you Quotation
better Quotation
look Quotation
out." Quotation
"Well, Quotation
you Quotation
SAID Quotation
you'd Quotation
do Quotation
it-- Quotation
why Quotation
don't Quotation
you Quotation
do Quotation
it?" Quotation
"By Quotation
jingo! Quotation
for Quotation
two Quotation
cents Quotation
I Quotation
WILL Quotation
do Quotation
it." Quotation
The O
new O
boy O
took O
two O
broad O
coppers O
out O
of O
his O
pocket O
and O
held O
them O
out O
with O
derision. O
Tom O
struck O
them O
to O
the O
ground. O
In O
an O
instant O
both O
boys O
were O
rolling O
and O
tumbling O
in O
the O
dirt, O
gripped O
together O
like O
cats; O
and O
for O
the O
space O
of O
a O
minute O
they O
tugged O
and O
tore O
at O
each O
other's O
hair O
and O
clothes, O
punched O
and O
scratched O
each O
other's O
nose, O
and O
covered O
themselves O
with O
dust O
and O
glory. O
Presently O
the O
confusion O
took O
form, O
and O
through O
the O
fog O
of O
battle O
Tom O
appeared, O
seated O
astride O
the Entity
new Entity
boy, Entity
and O
pounding O
him O
with O
his O
fists. O
"Holler Quotation
'nuff!" Quotation
said Cue
he. Entity
The O
boy O
only O
struggled O
to O
free O
himself. O
He Entity
was O
crying-- O
mainly O
from O
rage. O
"Holler Quotation
'nuff!"-- Quotation
and O
the O
pounding O
went O
on. O
At O
last O
the Entity
stranger Entity
got Cue
out Cue
a O
smothered O
"'Nuff!" Quotation
and O
Tom Entity
let O
him O
up O
and O
said: Cue
"Now Quotation
that'll Quotation
learn Quotation
you. Quotation
Better Quotation
look Quotation
out Quotation
who Quotation
you're Quotation
fooling Quotation
with Quotation
next Quotation
time." Quotation
The Entity
new Entity
boy Entity
went O
off O
brushing O
the O
dust O
from O
his O
clothes, O
sobbing, O
snuffling, O
and O
occasionally O
looking O
back O
and O
shaking O
his O
head O
and O
threatening O
what O
he O
would O
do O
to O
Tom Entity
the O
"next Quotation
time Quotation
he Quotation
caught Quotation
him Quotation
out." Quotation
To O
which O
Tom O
responded O
with O
jeers, O
and O
started O
off O
in O
high O
feather, O
and O
as O
soon O
as O
his O
back O
was O
turned O
the O
new O
boy O
snatched O
up O
a O
stone, O
threw O
it O
and O
hit O
him O
between O
the O
shoulders O
and O
then O
turned O
tail O
and O
ran O
like O
an O
antelope. O
Tom O
chased O
the O
traitor O
home, O
and O
thus O
found O
out O
where O
he O
lived. O
He O
then O
held O
a O
position O
at O
the O
gate O
for O
some O
time, O
daring O
the O
enemy O
to O
come O
outside, O
but O
the O
enemy O
only O
made O
faces O
at O
him O
through O
the O
window O
and O
declined. O
At O
last O
the Entity
enemy's Entity
mother Entity
appeared, O
and O
called Cue
Tom Entity
a Quotation
bad, Quotation
vicious, Quotation
vulgar Quotation
child, Quotation
and O
ordered O
him O
away. O
So O
he O
went O
away; O
but O
he Entity
said Cue
he O
"'lowed" Quotation
to O
"lay" Quotation
for O
that O
boy. O
He O
got O
home O
pretty O
late O
that O
night, O
and O
when O
he O
climbed O
cautiously O
in O
at O
the O
window, O
he O
uncovered O
an O
ambuscade, O
in O
the O
person O
of O
his O
aunt; O
and O
when O
she O
saw O
the O
state O
his O
clothes O
were O
in O
her O
resolution O
to O
turn O
his O
Saturday O
holiday O
into O
captivity O
at O
hard O
labor O
became O
adamantine O
in O
its O
firmness. O
CHAPTER O
II O
SATURDAY O
morning O
was O
come, O
and O
all O
the O
summer O
world O
was O
bright O
and O
fresh, O
and O
brimming O
with O
life. O
There O
was O
a O
song O
in O
every O
heart; O
and O
if O
the O
heart O
was O
young O
the O
music O
issued O
at O
the O
lips. O
There O
was O
cheer O
in O
every O
face O
and O
a O
spring O
in O
every O
step. O
The O
locust-trees O
were O
in O
bloom O
and O
the O
fragrance O
of O
the O
blossoms O
filled O
the O
air. O
Cardiff O
Hill, O
beyond O
the O
village O
and O
above O
it, O
was O
green O
with O
vegetation O
and O
it O
lay O
just O
far O
enough O
away O
to O
seem O
a O
Delectable O
Land, O
dreamy, O
reposeful, O
and O
inviting. O
Tom O
appeared O
on O
the O
sidewalk O
with O
a O
bucket O
of O
whitewash O
and O
a O
long-handled O
brush. O
He O
surveyed O
the O
fence, O
and O
all O
gladness O
left O
him O
and O
a O
deep O
melancholy O
settled O
down O
upon O
his O
spirit. O
Thirty O
yards O
of O
board O
fence O
nine O
feet O
high. O
Life O
to O
him O
seemed O
hollow, O
and O
existence O
but O
a O
burden. O
Sighing, O
he O
dipped O
his O
brush O
and O
passed O
it O
along O
the O
topmost O
plank; O
repeated O
the O
operation; O
did O
it O
again; O
compared O
the O
insignificant O
whitewashed O
streak O
with O
the O
far-reaching O
continent O
of O
unwhitewashed O
fence, O
and O
sat O
down O
on O
a O
tree-box O
discouraged. O
Jim O
came O
skipping O
out O
at O
the O
gate O
with O
a O
tin O
pail, O
and O
singing O
Buffalo O
Gals. O
Bringing O
water O
from O
the O
town O
pump O
had O
always O
been O
hateful O
work O
in O
Tom's O
eyes, O
before, O
but O
now O
it O
did O
not O
strike O
him O
so. O
He O
remembered O
that O
there O
was O
company O
at O
the O
pump. O
White, O
mulatto, O
and O
negro O
boys O
and O
girls O
were O
always O
there O
waiting O
their O
turns, O
resting, O
trading O
playthings, O
quarrelling, O
fighting, O
skylarking. O
And O
he O
remembered O
that O
although O
the O
pump O
was O
only O
a O
hundred O
and O
fifty O
yards O
off, O
Jim O
never O
got O
back O
with O
a O
bucket O
of O
water O
under O
an O
hour-- O
and O
even O
then O
somebody O
generally O
had O
to O
go O
after O
him. O
Tom Entity
said: Cue
"Say, Quotation
Jim, Quotation
I'll Quotation
fetch Quotation
the Quotation
water Quotation
if Quotation
you'll Quotation
whitewash Quotation
some." Quotation
Jim Entity
shook O
his O
head O
and O
said: Cue
"Can't, Quotation

"Oh, Quotation

That's Quotation

Jim, Quotation
I'll Quotation
give Quotation

a Quotation
marvel. Quotation
I'll Quotation
give Quotation

a Quotation
white Quotation

Jim Entity
began O
to O
waver. O
"White Quotation
alley, Quotation
Jim! Quotation
And Quotation
it's Quotation
a Quotation
bully Quotation
taw." Quotation
"My! Quotation
Dat's Quotation
a Quotation

But Quotation

" Quotation
"And Quotation
besides, Quotation
if Quotation
you Quotation
will Quotation
I'll Quotation
show Quotation
you Quotation
my Quotation
sore Quotation
toe." Quotation
Jim O
was O
only O
human-- O
this O
attraction O
was O
too O
much O
for O
him. O
He O
put O
down O
his O
pail, O
took O
the O
white O
alley, O
and O
bent O
over O
the O
toe O
with O
absorbing O
interest O
while O
the O
bandage O
was O
being O
unwound. O
In O
another O
moment O
he O
was O
flying O
down O
the O
street O
with O
his O
pail O
and O
a O
tingling O
rear, O
Tom O
was O
whitewashing O
with O
vigor, O
and O
Aunt O
Polly O
was O
retiring O
from O
the O
field O
with O
a O
slipper O
in O
her O
hand O
and O
triumph O
in O
her O
eye. O
But O
Tom's O
energy O
did O
not O
last. O
He O
began O
to O
think O
of O
the O
fun O
he O
had O
planned O
for O
this O
day, O
and O
his O
sorrows O
multiplied. O
Soon O
the O
free O
boys O
would O
come O
tripping O
along O
on O
all O
sorts O
of O
delicious O
expeditions, O
and O
they O
would O
make O
a O
world O
of O
fun O
of O
him O
for O
having O
to O
work-- O
the O
very O
thought O
of O
it O
burnt O
him O
like O
fire. O
He O
got O
out O
his O
worldly O
wealth O
and O
examined O
it-- O
bits O
of O
toys, O
marbles, O
and O
trash; O
enough O
to O
buy O
an O
exchange O
of O
WORK, O
maybe, O
but O
not O
half O
enough O
to O
buy O
so O
much O
as O
half O
an O
hour O
of O
pure O
freedom. O
So O
he O
returned O
his O
straitened O
means O
to O
his O
pocket, O
and O
gave O
up O
the O
idea O
of O
trying O
to O
buy O
the O
boys. O
At O
this O
dark O
and O
hopeless O
moment O
an O
inspiration O
burst O
upon O
him! O
Nothing O
less O
than O
a O
great, O
magnificent O
inspiration. O
He O
took O
up O
his O
brush O
and O
went O
tranquilly O
to O
work. O
Ben O
Rogers O
hove O
in O
sight O
presently-- O
the O
very O
boy, O
of O
all O
boys, O
whose O
ridicule O
he O
had O
been O
dreading. O
Ben's O
gait O
was O
the O
hop-skip-and-jump-- O
proof O
enough O
that O
his O
heart O
was O
light O
and O
his O
anticipations O
high. O
He O
was O
eating O
an O
apple, O
and O
giving O
a O
long, O
melodious O
whoop, O
at O
intervals, O
followed O
by O
a O
deep-toned O
ding-dong-dong, O
ding-dong-dong, O
for O
he O
was O
personating O
a O
steamboat. O
As O
he O
drew O
near, O
he O
slackened O
speed, O
took O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
street, O
leaned O
far O
over O
to O
starboard O
and O
rounded O
to O
ponderously O
and O
with O
laborious O
pomp O
and O
circumstance-- O
for O
he O
was O
personating O
the O
Big O
Missouri, O
and O
considered O
himself O
to O
be O
drawing O
nine O
feet O
of O
water. O
He O
was O
boat O
and O
captain O
and O
engine-bells O
combined, O
so O
he Entity
had O
to O
imagine O
himself O
standing O
on O
his O
own O
hurricane-deck O
giving O
the O
orders O
and O
executing O
them: O
"Stop Quotation
her, Quotation
sir! Quotation
Ting-a-ling-ling!" Quotation
The O
headway O
ran O
almost O
out, O
and O
he O
drew O
up O
slowly O
toward O
the O
sidewalk. O
"Ship Quotation
up Quotation
to Quotation
back! Quotation
Ting-a-ling-ling!" Quotation
His O
arms O
straightened O
and O
stiffened O
down O
his O
sides. O
"Set Quotation
her Quotation
back Quotation
on Quotation
the Quotation
stabboard! Quotation
Ting-a-ling-ling! Quotation
Chow! Quotation
ch-chow-wow! Quotation
Chow!" Quotation
His O
right O
hand, O
meantime, O
describing O
stately O
circles-- O
for O
it O
was O
representing O
a O
forty-foot O
wheel. O
"Let Quotation
her Quotation
go Quotation
back Quotation
on Quotation
the Quotation
labboard! Quotation
Ting-a-lingling! Quotation
Chow-ch-chow-chow!" Quotation
The O
left O
hand O
began O
to O
describe O
circles. O
"Stop Quotation
the Quotation
stabboard! Quotation
Ting-a-ling-ling! Quotation
Stop Quotation
the Quotation
labboard! Quotation
Come Quotation
ahead Quotation
on Quotation
the Quotation
stabboard! Quotation
Stop Quotation
her! Quotation
Let Quotation
your Quotation
outside Quotation
turn Quotation
over Quotation
slow! Quotation
Ting-a-ling-ling! Quotation
Chow-ow-ow! Quotation
Get Quotation
out Quotation
that Quotation
head-line! Quotation
LIVELY Quotation
now! Quotation
Come-- Quotation
out Quotation
with Quotation
your Quotation
spring-line-- Quotation
what're Quotation
you Quotation
about Quotation
there! Quotation
Take Quotation
a Quotation
turn Quotation
round Quotation
that Quotation
stump Quotation
with Quotation
the Quotation
bight Quotation
of Quotation
it! Quotation
Stand Quotation
by Quotation
that Quotation
stage, Quotation
now-- Quotation
let Quotation
her Quotation
go! Quotation
Done Quotation
with Quotation
the Quotation
engines, Quotation
sir! Quotation
Ting-a-ling-ling! Quotation
SH'T! Quotation
S'H'T! Quotation
SH'T!" Quotation
(trying O
the O
gauge-cocks). O
Tom Entity
went O
on O
whitewashing-- O
paid O
no O
attention O
to O
the O
steamboat. O
Ben Entity
stared O
a O
moment O
and O
then O
said: Cue
"Hi-YI! Quotation
YOU'RE Quotation
up Quotation
a Quotation
stump, Quotation
ain't Quotation
you!" Quotation
No O
answer. O
Tom O
surveyed O
his O
last O
touch O
with O
the O
eye O
of O
an O
artist, O
then O
he O
gave O
his O
brush O
another O
gentle O
sweep O
and O
surveyed O
the O
result, O
as O
before. O
Ben O
ranged O
up O
alongside O
of O
him. O
Tom's O
mouth O
watered O
for O
the O
apple, O
but O
he O
stuck O
to O
his O
work. O
Ben Entity
said: Cue
"Hello, Quotation
old Quotation
chap, Quotation
you Quotation
got Quotation
to Quotation
work, Quotation
hey?" Quotation
Tom Entity
wheeled O
suddenly O
and O
said: Cue
"Why, Quotation
it's Quotation
you, Quotation
Ben! Quotation
I Quotation
warn't Quotation
noticing." Quotation
"Say-- Quotation
I'm Quotation
going Quotation
in Quotation
a-swimming, Quotation
I Quotation
am. Quotation
Don't Quotation
you Quotation
wish Quotation
you Quotation
could? Quotation
But Quotation
of Quotation
course Quotation
you'd Quotation
druther Quotation
WORK-- Quotation
wouldn't Quotation
you? Quotation
Course Quotation
you Quotation
would!" Quotation
Tom Entity
contemplated O
the Entity
boy Entity
a O
bit, O
and O
said: Cue
"What Quotation
do Quotation
you Quotation
call Quotation
work?" Quotation
"Why, Quotation
ain't Quotation
THAT Quotation
work?" Quotation
Tom Entity
resumed O
his O
whitewashing, O
and O
answered Cue
carelessly: O
"Well, Quotation
maybe Quotation
it Quotation
is, Quotation
and Quotation
maybe Quotation
it Quotation
ain't. Quotation
All Quotation
I Quotation
know, Quotation
is, Quotation
it Quotation
suits Quotation
Tom Quotation
Sawyer." Quotation
"Oh Quotation
come, Quotation
now, Quotation
you Quotation
don't Quotation
mean Quotation
to Quotation
let Quotation
on Quotation
that Quotation
you Quotation
LIKE Quotation
it?" Quotation
The O
brush O
continued O
to O
move. O
"Like Quotation
it? Quotation
Well, Quotation
I Quotation
don't Quotation
see Quotation
why Quotation
I Quotation
oughtn't Quotation
to Quotation
like Quotation
it. Quotation
Does Quotation
a Quotation
boy Quotation
get Quotation
a Quotation
chance Quotation
to Quotation
whitewash Quotation
a Quotation
fence Quotation
every Quotation
day?" Quotation
That O
put O
the O
thing O
in O
a O
new O
light. O
Ben O
stopped O
nibbling O
his O
apple. O
Tom O
swept O
his O
brush O
daintily O
back O
and O
forth-- O
stepped O
back O
to O
note O
the O
effect-- O
added O
a O
touch O
here O
and O
there-- O
criticised O
the O
effect O
again-- O
Ben O
watching O
every O
move O
and O
getting O
more O
and O
more O
interested, O
more O
and O
more O
absorbed. O
Presently O
he Entity
said: Cue
"Say, Quotation
Tom, Quotation
let Quotation
ME Quotation
whitewash Quotation
a Quotation
little." Quotation
Tom Entity
considered, O
was O
about O
to O
consent; O
but O
he O
altered O
his O
mind: O
"No-- Quotation
no Quotation
-- Quotation
I Quotation
reckon Quotation
it Quotation
wouldn't Quotation
hardly Quotation
do, Quotation
Ben. Quotation
You Quotation
see, Quotation
Aunt Quotation
Polly's Quotation
awful Quotation
particular Quotation
about Quotation
this Quotation
fence-- Quotation
right Quotation
here Quotation
on Quotation
the Quotation
street, Quotation
you Quotation
know Quotation
--but Quotation
if Quotation
it Quotation
was Quotation
the Quotation
back Quotation
fence Quotation
I Quotation
wouldn't Quotation
mind Quotation
and Quotation
SHE Quotation
wouldn't. Quotation
Yes, Quotation
she's Quotation
awful Quotation
particular Quotation
about Quotation
this Quotation
fence; Quotation
it's Quotation
got Quotation
to Quotation
be Quotation
done Quotation
very Quotation
careful; Quotation
I Quotation
reckon Quotation
there Quotation
ain't Quotation
one Quotation
boy Quotation
in Quotation
a Quotation
thousand, Quotation
maybe Quotation
two Quotation
thousand, Quotation
that Quotation
can Quotation
do Quotation
it Quotation
the Quotation
way Quotation
it's Quotation
got Quotation
to Quotation
be Quotation
done." Quotation
"No-- Quotation
is Quotation
that Quotation
so? Quotation
Oh Quotation
come, Quotation
now-- Quotation
lemme Quotation
just Quotation
try. Quotation
Only Quotation
just Quotation
a Quotation
little-- Quotation
I'd Quotation
let Quotation
YOU, Quotation
if Quotation
you Quotation
was Quotation
me, Quotation
Tom." Quotation
"Ben, Quotation
I'd Quotation
like Quotation
to, Quotation
honest Quotation
injun; Quotation
but Quotation
Aunt Quotation
Polly-- Quotation
well, Quotation
Jim Quotation
wanted Quotation
to Quotation
do Quotation
it, Quotation
but Quotation
she Quotation
wouldn't Quotation
let Quotation
him; Quotation
Sid Quotation
wanted Quotation
to Quotation
do Quotation
it, Quotation
and Quotation
she Quotation
wouldn't Quotation
let Quotation
Sid. Quotation
Now Quotation
don't Quotation
you Quotation
see Quotation
how Quotation
I'm Quotation
fixed? Quotation
If Quotation
you Quotation
was Quotation
to Quotation
tackle Quotation
this Quotation
fence Quotation
and Quotation
anything Quotation
was Quotation
to Quotation
happen Quotation
to Quotation
it Quotation
-- Quotation
" Quotation
"Oh, Quotation
shucks, Quotation
I'll Quotation
be Quotation
just Quotation
as Quotation
careful. Quotation
Now Quotation
lemme Quotation
try. Quotation
Say-- Quotation
I'll Quotation
give Quotation
you Quotation
the Quotation
core Quotation
of Quotation
my Quotation
apple." Quotation
"Well, Quotation
here-- Quotation
No, Quotation
Ben, Quotation
now Quotation
don't. Quotation
I'm Quotation
afeard Quotation
-- Quotation
" Quotation
"I'll Quotation
give Quotation
you Quotation
ALL Quotation
of Quotation
it!" Quotation
Tom O
gave O
up O
the O
brush O
with O
reluctance O
in O
his O
face, O
but O
alacrity O
in O
his O
heart. O
And O
while O
the O
late O
steamer O
Big O
Missouri O
worked O
and O
sweated O
in O
the O
sun, O
the O
retired O
artist O
sat O
on O
a O
barrel O
in O
the O
shade O
close O
by, O
dangled O
his O
legs, O
munched O
his O
apple, O
and O
planned O
the O
slaughter O
of O
more O
innocents. O
There O
was O
no O
lack O
of O
material; O
boys O
happened O
along O
every O
little O
while; O
they O
came O
to O
jeer, O
but O
remained O
to O
whitewash. O
By O
the O
time O
Ben O
was O
fagged O
out, O
Tom O
had O
traded O
the O
next O
chance O
to O
Billy O
Fisher O
for O
a O
kite, O
in O
good O
repair; O
and O
when O
he O
played O
out, O
Johnny O
Miller O
bought O
in O
for O
a O
dead O
rat O
and O
a O
string O
to O
swing O
it O
with-- O
and O
so O
on, O
and O
so O
on, O
hour O
after O
hour. O
And O
when O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
afternoon O
came, O
from O
being O
a O
poor O
poverty-stricken O
boy O
in O
the O
morning, O
Tom O
was O
literally O
rolling O
in O
wealth. O
He O
had O
besides O
the O
things O
before O
mentioned, O
twelve O
marbles, O
part O
of O
a O
jews-harp, O
a O
piece O
of O
blue O
bottle-glass O
to O
look O
through, O
a O
spool O
cannon, O
a O
key O
that O
wouldn't O
unlock O
anything, O
a O
fragment O
of O
chalk, O
a O
glass O
stopper O
of O
a O
decanter, O
a O
tin O
soldier, O
a O
couple O
of O
tadpoles, O
six O
fire-crackers, O
a O
kitten O
with O
only O
one O
eye, O
a O
brass O
doorknob, O
a O
dog-collar-- O
but O
no O
dog-- O
the O
handle O
of O
a O
knife, O
four O
pieces O
of O
orange-peel, O
and O
a O
dilapidated O
old O
window O
sash. O
He O
had O
had O
a O
nice, O
good, O
idle O
time O
all O
the O
while-- O
plenty O
of O
company O
--and O
the O
fence O
had O
three O
coats O
of O
whitewash O
on O
it! O
If O
he O
hadn't O
run O
out O
of O
whitewash O
he O
would O
have O
bankrupted O
every O
boy O
in O
the O
village. O
Tom O
said O
to O
himself O
that O
it O
was O
not O
such O
a O
hollow O
world, O
after O
all. O
He O
had O
discovered O
a O
great O
law O
of O
human O
action, O
without O
knowing O
it-- O
namely, O
that O
in O
order O
to O
make O
a O
man O
or O
a O
boy O
covet O
a O
thing, O
it O
is O
only O
necessary O
to O
make O
the O
thing O
difficult O
to O
attain. O
If O
he O
had O
been O
a O
great O
and O
wise O
philosopher, O
like O
the O
writer O
of O
this O
book, O
he O
would O
now O
have O
comprehended O
that O
Work O
consists O
of O
whatever O
a O
body O
is O
OBLIGED O
to O
do, O
and O
that O
Play O
consists O
of O
whatever O
a O
body O
is O
not O
obliged O
to O
do. O
And O
this O
would O
help O
him O
to O
understand O
why O
constructing O
artificial O
flowers O
or O
performing O
on O
a O
tread-mill O
is O
work, O
while O
rolling O
ten-pins O
or O
climbing O
Mont O
Blanc O
is O
only O
amusement. O
There O
are O
wealthy O
gentlemen O
in O
England O
who O
drive O
four-horse O
passenger-coaches O
twenty O
or O
thirty O
miles O
on O
a O
daily O
line, O
in O
the O
summer, O
because O
the O
privilege O
costs O
them O
considerable O
money; O
but O
if O
they O
were O
offered O
wages O
for O
the O
service, O
that O
would O
turn O
it O
into O
work O
and O
then O
they O
would O
resign. O
The O
boy O
mused O
awhile O
over O
the O
substantial O
change O
which O
had O
taken O
place O
in O
his O
worldly O
circumstances, O
and O
then O
wended O

CHAPTER O
III O
TOM O
presented O
himself O
before O
Aunt O
Polly, O
who O
was O
sitting O
by O
an O
open O
window O
in O
a O
pleasant O
rearward O
apartment, O
which O
was O
bedroom, O
breakfast-room, O
dining-room, O
and O
library, O
combined. O
The O
balmy O
summer O
air, O
the O
restful O
quiet, O
the O
odor O
of O
the O
flowers, O
and O
the O
drowsing O
murmur O
of O
the O
bees O
had O
had O
their O
effect, O
and O
she O
was O
nodding O
over O
her O
knitting O
--for O
she O
had O
no O
company O
but O
the O
cat, O
and O
it O
was O
asleep O
in O
her O
lap. O
Her O
spectacles O
were O
propped O
up O
on O
her O
gray O
head O
for O
safety. O
She O
had O
thought O
that O
of O
course O
Tom O
had O
deserted O
long O
ago, O
and O
she Entity
wondered O
at O
seeing O
him O
place O
himself O
in O
her O
power O
again O
in O
this O
intrepid O
way. O
He Entity
said: Cue
"Mayn't Quotation
I Quotation
go Quotation
and Quotation
play Quotation
now, Quotation
aunt?" Quotation
"What, Quotation
a'ready? Quotation
How Quotation
much Quotation
have Quotation
you Quotation
done?" Quotation
"It's Quotation
all Quotation
done, Quotation
aunt." Quotation
"Tom, Quotation
don't Quotation
lie Quotation
to Quotation
me Quotation
-- Quotation
I Quotation
can't Quotation
bear Quotation
it." Quotation
"I Quotation
ain't, Quotation
aunt; Quotation
it Quotation
IS Quotation
all Quotation
done." Quotation
Aunt O
Polly O
placed O
small O
trust O
in O
such O
evidence. O
She O
went O
out O
to O
see O
for O
herself; O
and O
she O
would O
have O
been O
content O
to O
find O
twenty O
per O
cent. O
of O
Tom's Entity
statement O
true. O
When O
she O
found O
the O
entire O
fence O
whitewashed, O
and O
not O
only O
whitewashed O
but O
elaborately O
coated O
and O
recoated, O
and O
even O
a O
streak O
added O
to O
the O
ground, O
her O
astonishment O
was O
almost O
unspeakable. O
She Entity
said: Cue
"Well, Quotation
I Quotation
never! Quotation
There's Quotation
no Quotation
getting Quotation
round Quotation
it, Quotation
you Quotation
can Quotation
work Quotation
when Quotation
you're Quotation
a Quotation
mind Quotation
to, Quotation
Tom." Quotation
And O
then O
she Entity
diluted O
the O
compliment O
by O
adding, Cue
"But Quotation
it's Quotation
powerful Quotation
seldom Quotation
you're Quotation
a Quotation
mind Quotation
to, Quotation
I'm Quotation
bound Quotation
to Quotation
say. Quotation
Well, Quotation
go Quotation
'long Quotation
and Quotation
play; Quotation
but Quotation
mind Quotation
you Quotation
get Quotation
back Quotation
some Quotation
time Quotation
in Quotation
a Quotation
week, Quotation
or Quotation
I'll Quotation
tan Quotation
you." Quotation
She O
was O
so O
overcome O
by O
the O
splendor O
of O
his Entity
achievement O
that O
she Entity
took O
him O
into O
the O
closet O
and O
selected O
a O
choice O
apple O
and O
delivered O
it O
to O
him, O
along O
with O
an O
improving O
lecture O
upon Quotation
the Quotation
added Quotation
value Quotation
and Quotation
flavor Quotation
a Quotation
treat Quotation
took Quotation
to Quotation
itself Quotation
when Quotation
it Quotation
came Quotation
without Quotation
sin Quotation
through Quotation
virtuous Quotation
effort. Quotation
And O
while O
she O
closed O
with O
a O
happy O
Scriptural O
flourish, O
he O
"hooked" O
a O
doughnut. O
Then O
he O
skipped O
out, O
and O
saw O
Sid O
just O
starting O
up O
the O
outside O
stairway O
that O
led O
to O
the O
back O
rooms O
on O
the O
second O
floor. O
Clods O
were O
handy O
and O
the O
air O
was O
full O
of O
them O
in O
a O
twinkling. O
They O
raged O
around O
Sid O
like O
a O
hail-storm; O
and O
before O
Aunt O
Polly O
could O
collect O
her O
surprised O
faculties O
and O
sally O
to O
the O
rescue, O
six O
or O
seven O
clods O
had O
taken O
personal O
effect, O
and O
Tom O
was O
over O
the O
fence O
and O
gone. O
There O
was O
a O
gate, O
but O
as O
a O
general O
thing O
he O
was O
too O
crowded O
for O
time O
to O
make O
use O
of O
it. O
His O
soul O
was O
at O
peace, O
now O
that O
he O
had O
settled O
with O
Sid O
for O
calling O
attention O
to O
his O
black O
thread O
and O
getting O
him O
into O
trouble. O
Tom O
skirted O
the O
block, O
and O
came O
round O
into O
a O
muddy O
alley O
that O
led O
by O
the O
back O
of O
his O
aunt's O
cow-stable. O
He O
presently O
got O
safely O
beyond O
the O
reach O
of O
capture O
and O
punishment, O
and O
hastened O
toward O
the O
public O
square O
of O
the O
village, O
where O
two O
"military" O
companies O
of O
boys O
had O
met O
for O
conflict, O
according O
to O
previous O
appointment. O
Tom O
was O
General O
of O
one O
of O
these O
armies, O
Joe O
Harper O
(a O
bosom O
friend) O
General O
of O
the O
other. O
These O
two O
great O
commanders O
did O
not O
condescend O
to O
fight O
in O
person-- O
that O
being O
better O
suited O
to O
the O
still O
smaller O
fry-- O
but O
sat O
together O
on O
an O
eminence O
and O
conducted O
the O
field O
operations O
by O
orders O
delivered O
through O
aides-de-camp. O
Tom's O
army O
won O
a O
great O
victory, O
after O
a O
long O
and O
hard-fought O
battle. O
Then O
the O
dead O
were O
counted, O
prisoners O
exchanged, O
the O
terms O
of O
the O
next O
disagreement O
agreed O
upon, O
and O
the O
day O
for O
the O
necessary O
battle O
appointed; O
after O
which O
the O
armies O
fell O
into O
line O
and O
marched O
away, O
and O
Tom O
turned O
homeward O
alone. O
As O
he O
was O
passing O
by O
the O
house O
where O
Jeff O
Thatcher O
lived, O
he O
saw O
a O
new O
girl O
in O
the O
garden O
-- O
a O
lovely O
little O
blue-eyed O
creature O
with O
yellow O
hair O
plaited O
into O
two O
long-tails, O
white O
summer O
frock O
and O
embroidered O
pantalettes. O
The O
fresh-crowned O
hero O
fell O
without O
firing O
a O
shot. O
A O
certain O
Amy O
Lawrence O
vanished O
out O
of O
his O
heart O
and O
left O
not O
even O
a O
memory O
of O
herself O
behind. O
He O
had O
thought O
he O
loved O
her O
to O
distraction; O
he O
had O
regarded O
his O
passion O
as O
adoration; O
and O
behold O
it O
was O
only O
a O
poor O
little O
evanescent O
partiality. O
He O
had O
been O
months O
winning O
her; O
she O
had O
confessed O
hardly O
a O
week O
ago; O
he O
had O
been O
the O
happiest O
and O
the O
proudest O
boy O
in O
the O
world O
only O
seven O
short O
days, O
and O
here O
in O
one O
instant O
of O
time O
she O
had O
gone O
out O
of O
his O
heart O
like O
a O
casual O
stranger O
whose O
visit O
is O
done. O
He O
worshipped O
this O
new O
angel O
with O
furtive O
eye, O
till O
he O
saw O
that O
she O
had O
discovered O
him; O
then O
he O
pretended O
he O
did O
not O
know O
she O
was O
present, O
and O
began O
to O
"show O
off" O
in O
all O
sorts O
of O
absurd O
boyish O
ways, O
in O
order O
to O
win O
her O
admiration. O
He O
kept O
up O
this O
grotesque O
foolishness O
for O
some O
time; O
but O
by-and-by, O
while O
he O
was O
in O
the O
midst O
of O
some O
dangerous O
gymnastic O
performances, O
he O
glanced O
aside O
and O
saw O
that O
the O
little O
girl O
was O
wending O
her O
way O
toward O
the O
house. O
Tom O
came O
up O
to O
the O
fence O
and O
leaned O
on O
it, O
grieving, O
and O
hoping O
she O
would O
tarry O
yet O
awhile O
longer. O
She O
halted O
a O
moment O
on O
the O
steps O
and O
then O
moved O
toward O
the O
door. O
Tom O
heaved O
a O
great O
sigh O
as O
she O
put O
her O
foot O
on O
the O
threshold. O
But O
his O
face O
lit O
up, O
right O
away, O
for O
she O
tossed O
a O
pansy O
over O
the O
fence O
a O
moment O
before O
she O
disappeared. O
The O
boy O
ran O
around O
and O
stopped O
within O
a O
foot O
or O
two O
of O
the O
flower, O
and O
then O
shaded O
his O
eyes O
with O
his O
hand O
and O
began O
to O
look O
down O
street O
as O
if O
he O
had O
discovered O
something O
of O
interest O
going O
on O
in O
that O
direction. O
Presently O
he O
picked O
up O
a O
straw O
and O
began O
trying O
to O
balance O
it O
on O
his O
nose, O
with O
his O
head O
tilted O
far O
back; O
and O
as O
he O
moved O
from O
side O
to O
side, O
in O
his O
efforts, O
he O
edged O
nearer O
and O
nearer O
toward O
the O
pansy; O
finally O
his O
bare O
foot O
rested O
upon O
it, O
his O
pliant O
toes O
closed O
upon O
it, O
and O
he O
hopped O
away O
with O
the O
treasure O
and O
disappeared O
round O
the O
corner. O
But O
only O
for O
a O
minute-- O
only O
while O
he O
could O
button O
the O
flower O
inside O
his O
jacket, O
next O
his O
heart-- O
or O
next O
his O
stomach, O
possibly, O
for O
he O
was O
not O
much O
posted O
in O
anatomy, O
and O
not O
hypercritical, O
anyway. O
He O
returned, O
now, O
and O
hung O
about O
the O
fence O
till O
nightfall, O
"showing O
off," O
as O
before; O
but O
the O
girl O
never O
exhibited O
herself O
again, O
though O
Tom O
comforted O
himself O
a O
little O
with O
the O
hope O
that O
she O
had O
been O
near O
some O
window, O
meantime, O
and O
been O
aware O
of O
his O
attentions. O
Finally O
he O
strode O
home O
reluctantly, O
with O
his O
poor O
head O
full O
of O
visions. O
All O
through O
supper O
his O
spirits O
were O
so O
high O
that O
his Entity
aunt Entity
wondered O
"what O
had O
got O
into O
the O
child." O
He Entity
took O
a O
good O
scolding O
about Quotation
clodding Quotation
Sid, Quotation
and O
did O
not O
seem O
to O
mind O
it O
in O
the O
least. O
He O
tried O
to O
steal O
sugar O
under O
his Entity
aunt's Entity
very O
nose, O
and O
got O
his O
knuckles O
rapped O
for O
it. O
He Entity
said: Cue
"Aunt, Quotation
you Quotation
don't Quotation
whack Quotation
Sid Quotation
when Quotation
he Quotation
takes Quotation
it." Quotation
"Well, Quotation
Sid Quotation
don't Quotation
torment Quotation
a Quotation
body Quotation
the Quotation
way Quotation
you Quotation
do. Quotation
You'd Quotation
be Quotation
always Quotation
into Quotation
that Quotation
sugar Quotation
if Quotation
I Quotation
warn't Quotation
watching Quotation
you." Quotation
Presently O
she O
stepped O
into O
the O
kitchen, O
and O
Sid, O
happy O
in O
his O
immunity, O
reached O
for O
the O
sugar-bowl O
-- O
a O
sort O
of O
glorying O
over O
Tom O
which O
was O
wellnigh O
unbearable. O
But O
Sid's O
fingers O
slipped O
and O
the O
bowl O
dropped O
and O
broke. O
Tom O
was O
in O
ecstasies. O
In O
such O
ecstasies O
that O
he O
even O
controlled O
his O
tongue O
and O
was O
silent. O
He Entity
said Cue
to O
himself Entity
that Quotation
he Quotation
would Quotation
not Quotation
speak Quotation
a Quotation
word, Quotation
even Quotation
when Quotation
his Quotation
aunt Quotation
came Quotation
in, Quotation
but Quotation
would Quotation
sit Quotation
perfectly Quotation
still Quotation
till Quotation
she Quotation
asked Quotation
who Quotation
did Quotation
the Quotation
mischief; Quotation
and Quotation
then Quotation
he Quotation
would Quotation
tell, Quotation
and Quotation
there Quotation
would Quotation
be Quotation
nothing Quotation
so Quotation
good Quotation
in Quotation
the Quotation
world Quotation
as Quotation
to Quotation
see Quotation
that Quotation
pet Quotation
model Quotation
"catch Quotation
it." Quotation
He O
was O
so O
brimful O
of O
exultation O
that O
he O
could O
hardly O
hold O
himself O
when O
the O
old O
lady O
came O
back O
and O
stood O
above O
the O
wreck O
discharging O
lightnings O
of O
wrath O
from O
over O
her O
spectacles. O
He Entity
said Cue
to O
himself, Entity
"Now Quotation
it's Quotation
coming!" Quotation
And O
the O
next O
instant O
he O
was O
sprawling O
on O
the O
floor! O
The O
potent O
palm O
was O
uplifted O
to O
strike O
again O
when O
Tom Entity
cried Cue
out: Cue
"Hold Quotation
on, Quotation
now, Quotation
what Quotation
'er Quotation
you Quotation
belting Quotation
ME Quotation
for?-- Quotation
Sid Quotation
broke Quotation
it!" Quotation
Aunt Entity
Polly Entity
paused, O
perplexed, O
and O
Tom Entity
looked O
for O
healing O
pity. O
But O
when O
she O
got O
her O
tongue O
again, O
she Entity
only O
said: Cue
"Umf! Quotation
Well, Quotation
you Quotation
didn't Quotation
get Quotation
a Quotation
lick Quotation
amiss, Quotation
I Quotation
reckon. Quotation
You Quotation
been Quotation
into Quotation
some Quotation
other Quotation
audacious Quotation
mischief Quotation
when Quotation
I Quotation
wasn't Quotation
around, Quotation
like Quotation
enough." Quotation
Then O
her O
conscience O
reproached O
her, O
and O
she O
yearned O
to O
say O
something O
kind O
and O
loving; O
but O
she O
judged O
that O
this O
would O
be O
construed O
into O
a O
confession O
that O
she O
had O
been O
in O
the O
wrong, O
and O
discipline O
forbade O
that. O
So O
she O
kept O
silence, O
and O
went O
about O
her O
affairs O
with O
a O
troubled O
heart. O
Tom O
sulked O
in O
a O
corner O
and O
exalted O
his O
woes. O
He O
knew O
that O
in O
her O
heart O
his O
aunt O
was O
on O
her O
knees O
to O
him, O
and O
he O
was O
morosely O
gratified O
by O
the O
consciousness O
of O
it. O
He O
would O
hang O
out O
no O
signals, O
he O
would O
take O
notice O
of O
none. O
He O
knew O
that O
a O
yearning O
glance O
fell O
upon O
him, O
now O
and O
then, O
through O
a O
film O
of O
tears, O
but O
he O
refused O
recognition O
of O
it. O
He O
pictured O
himself O
lying O
sick O
unto O
death O
and O
his O
aunt O
bending O
over O
him O
beseeching O
one O
little O
forgiving O
word, O
but O
he O
would O
turn O
his O
face O
to O
the O
wall, O
and O
die O
with O
that O
word O
unsaid. O
Ah, O
how O
would O
she O
feel O
then? O
And O
he O
pictured O
himself O
brought O
home O
from O
the O
river, O
dead, O
with O
his O
curls O
all O
wet, O
and O
his O
sore O
heart O
at O
rest. O
How O
she O
would O
throw O
herself O
upon O
him, O
and O
how O
her O
tears O
would O
fall O
like O
rain, O
and O
her O
lips O
pray O
God O
to O
give O
her O
back O
her O
boy O
and O
she O
would O
never, O
never O
abuse O
him O
any O
more! O
But O
he O
would O
lie O
there O
cold O
and O
white O
and O
make O
no O
sign O
-- O
a O
poor O
little O
sufferer, O
whose O
griefs O
were O
at O
an O
end. O
He O
so O
worked O
upon O
his O
feelings O
with O
the O
pathos O
of O
these O
dreams, O
that O
he O
had O
to O
keep O
swallowing, O
he O
was O
so O
like O
to O
choke; O
and O
his O
eyes O
swam O
in O
a O
blur O
of O
water, O
which O
overflowed O
when O
he O
winked, O
and O
ran O
down O
and O
trickled O
from O
the O
end O
of O
his O
nose. O
And O
such O
a O
luxury O
to O
him O
was O
this O
petting O
of O
his O
sorrows, O
that O
he O
could O
not O
bear O
to O
have O
any O
worldly O
cheeriness O
or O
any O
grating O
delight O
intrude O
upon O
it; O
it O
was O
too O
sacred O
for O
such O
contact; O
and O
so, O
presently, O
when O
his O
cousin O
Mary O
danced O
in, O
all O
alive O
with O
the O
joy O
of O
seeing O
home O
again O
after O
an O
age-long O
visit O
of O
one O
week O
to O
the O
country, O
he O
got O
up O
and O
moved O
in O
clouds O
and O
darkness O
out O
at O
one O
door O
as O
she O
brought O
song O
and O
sunshine O
in O
at O
the O
other. O
He O
wandered O
far O
from O
the O
accustomed O
haunts O
of O
boys, O
and O
sought O
desolate O
places O
that O
were O
in O
harmony O
with O
his O
spirit. O
A O
log O
raft O
in O
the O
river O
invited O
him, O
and O
he O
seated O
himself O
on O
its O
outer O
edge O
and O
contemplated O
the O
dreary O
vastness O
of O
the O
stream, O
wishing, O
the O
while, O
that O
he O
could O
only O
be O
drowned, O
all O
at O
once O
and O
unconsciously, O
without O
undergoing O
the O
uncomfortable O
routine O
devised O
by O
nature. O
Then O
he O
thought O
of O
his O
flower. O
He O
got O
it O
out, O
rumpled O
and O
wilted, O
and O
it O
mightily O
increased O
his O
dismal O
felicity. O
He O
wondered O
if O
she O
would O
pity O
him O
if O
she O
knew? O
Would O
she O
cry, O
and O
wish O
that O
she O
had O
a O
right O
to O
put O
her O
arms O
around O
his O
neck O
and O
comfort O
him? O
Or O
would O
she O
turn O
coldly O
away O
like O
all O
the O
hollow O
world? O
This O
picture O
brought O
such O
an O
agony O
of O
pleasurable O
suffering O
that O
he O
worked O
it O
over O
and O
over O
again O
in O
his O
mind O
and O
set O
it O
up O
in O
new O
and O
varied O
lights, O
till O
he O
wore O
it O
threadbare. O
At O
last O
he O
rose O
up O
sighing O
and O
departed O
in O
the O
darkness. O
About O
half-past O
nine O
or O
ten O
o'clock O
he O
came O
along O
the O
deserted O
street O
to O
where O
the O
Adored O
Unknown O
lived; O
he O
paused O
a O
moment; O
no O
sound O
fell O
upon O
his O
listening O
ear; O
a O
candle O
was O
casting O
a O
dull O
glow O
upon O
the O
curtain O
of O
a O
second-story O
window. O
Was O
the O
sacred O
presence O
there? O
He O
climbed O
the O
fence, O
threaded O
his O
stealthy O
way O
through O
the O
plants, O
till O
he O
stood O
under O
that O
window; O
he O
looked O
up O
at O
it O
long, O
and O
with O
emotion; O
then O
he O
laid O
him O
down O
on O
the O
ground O
under O
it, O
disposing O
himself O
upon O
his O
back, O
with O
his O
hands O
clasped O
upon O
his O
breast O
and O
holding O
his O
poor O
wilted O
flower. O
And O
thus O
he O
would O
die-- O
out O
in O
the O
cold O
world, O
with O
no O
shelter O
over O
his O
homeless O
head, O
no O
friendly O
hand O
to O
wipe O
the O
death-damps O
from O
his O
brow, O
no O
loving O
face O
to O
bend O
pityingly O
over O
him O
when O
the O
great O
agony O
came. O
And O
thus O
SHE O
would O
see O
him O
when O
she O
looked O
out O
upon O
the O
glad O
morning, O
and O
oh! O
would O
she O
drop O
one O
little O
tear O
upon O
his O
poor, O
lifeless O
form, O
would O
she O
heave O
one O
little O
sigh O
to O
see O
a O
bright O
young O
life O
so O
rudely O
blighted, O
so O
untimely O
cut O
down? O
The O
window O
went O
up, O
a O
maid-servant's O
discordant O
voice O
profaned O
the O
holy O
calm, O
and O
a O
deluge O
of O
water O
drenched O
the O
prone O
martyr's O
remains! O
The O
strangling O
hero O
sprang O
up O
with O
a O
relieving O
snort. O
There O
was O
a O
whiz O
as O
of O
a O
missile O
in O
the O
air, O
mingled O
with O
the O
murmur O
of O
a O
curse, O
a O
sound O
as O
of O
shivering O
glass O
followed, O
and O
a O
small, O
vague O
form O
went O
over O
the O
fence O
and O
shot O
away O
in O
the O
gloom. O
Not O
long O
after, O
as O
Tom, O
all O
undressed O
for O
bed, O
was O
surveying O
his O
drenched O
garments O
by O
the O
light O
of O
a O
tallow O
dip, O
Sid O
woke O
up; O
but O
if O
he O
had O
any O
dim O
idea O
of O
making O
any O
"references O
to O
allusions," O
he O
thought O
better O
of O
it O
and O
held O
his O
peace, O
for O
there O
was O
danger O
in O
Tom's O
eye. O
Tom O
turned O
in O
without O
the O
added O
vexation O
of O
prayers, O
and O
Sid O
made O
mental O
note O
of O
the O
omission. O
CHAPTER O
IV O
THE O
sun O
rose O
upon O
a O
tranquil O
world, O
and O
beamed O
down O
upon O
the O
peaceful O
village O
like O
a O
benediction. O
Breakfast O
over, O
Aunt O
Polly O
had O
family O
worship: O
it O
began O
with O
a O
prayer O
built O
from O
the O
ground O
up O
of O
solid O
courses O
of O
Scriptural O
quotations, O
welded O
together O
with O
a O
thin O
mortar O
of O
originality; O
and O
from O
the O
summit O
of O
this O
she O
delivered O
a O
grim O
chapter O
of O
the O
Mosaic O
Law, O
as O
from O
Sinai. O
Then O
Tom O
girded O
up O
his O
loins, O
so O
to O
speak, O
and O
went O
to O
work O
to O
"get O
his O
verses." O
Sid O
had O
learned O
his O
lesson O
days O
before. O
Tom O
bent O
all O
his O
energies O
to O
the O
memorizing O
of O
five O
verses, O
and O
he O
chose O
part O
of O
the O
Sermon O
on O
the O
Mount, O
because O
he O
could O
find O
no O
verses O
that O
were O
shorter. O
At O
the O
end O
of O
half O
an O
hour O
Tom O
had O
a O
vague O
general O
idea O
of O
his O
lesson, O
but O
no O
more, O
for O
his O
mind O
was O
traversing O
the O
whole O
field O
of O
human O
thought, O
and O
his O
hands O
were O
busy O
with O
distracting O
recreations. O
Mary Entity
took O
his O
book O
to O
hear O
him O
recite, O
and O
he Entity
tried O
to O
find O
his O
way O
through O
the O
fog: O

WHAT? Quotation
Why Quotation
don't Quotation
you Quotation
tell Quotation
me, Quotation
Mary?-- Quotation
what Quotation
do Quotation
you Quotation
want Quotation
to Quotation
be Quotation
so Quotation
mean Quotation
for?" Quotation
"Oh, Quotation
Tom, Quotation
you Quotation
poor Quotation
thick-headed Quotation
thing, Quotation
I'm Quotation
not Quotation
teasing Quotation
you. Quotation
I Quotation
wouldn't Quotation
do Quotation
that. Quotation
You Quotation
must Quotation
go Quotation
and Quotation
learn Quotation
it Quotation
again. Quotation
Don't Quotation
you Quotation
be Quotation
discouraged, Quotation
Tom, Quotation
you'll Quotation
manage Quotation
it-- Quotation
and Quotation
if Quotation
you Quotation
do, Quotation
I'll Quotation
give Quotation
you Quotation
something Quotation
ever Quotation
so Quotation
nice. Quotation
There, Quotation
now, Quotation
that's Quotation
a Quotation
good Quotation
boy." Quotation
"All Quotation
right! Quotation
What Quotation
is Quotation
it, Quotation
Mary, Quotation
tell Quotation
me Quotation
what Quotation
it Quotation
is." Quotation
"Never Quotation
you Quotation
mind, Quotation
Tom. Quotation
You Quotation
know Quotation
if Quotation
I Quotation
say Quotation
it's Quotation
nice, Quotation
it Quotation
is Quotation
nice." Quotation
"You Quotation
bet Quotation
you Quotation
that's Quotation
so, Quotation
Mary. Quotation
All Quotation
right, Quotation
I'll Quotation
tackle Quotation
it Quotation
again." Quotation
And O
he O
did O
"tackle O
it O
again"-- O
and O
under O
the O
double O
pressure O
of O
curiosity O
and O
prospective O
gain O
he O
did O
it O
with O
such O
spirit O
that O
he O
accomplished O
a O
shining O
success. O
Mary O
gave O
him O
a O
brand-new O
"Barlow" O
knife O
worth O
twelve O
and O
a O
half O
cents; O
and O
the O
convulsion O
of O
delight O
that O
swept O
his O
system O
shook O
him O
to O
his O
foundations. O
True, O
the O
knife O
would O
not O
cut O
anything, O
but O
it O
was O
a O
"sure-enough" O
Barlow, O
and O
there O
was O
inconceivable O
grandeur O
in O
that-- O
though O
where O
the O
Western O
boys O
ever O
got O
the O
idea O
that O
such O
a O
weapon O
could O
possibly O
be O
counterfeited O
to O
its O
injury O
is O
an O
imposing O
mystery O
and O
will O
always O
remain O
so, O
perhaps. O
Tom O
contrived O
to O
scarify O
the O
cupboard O
with O
it, O
and O
was O
arranging O
to O
begin O
on O
the O
bureau, O
when O
he O
was O
called O
off O
to O
dress O
for O
Sunday-school. O
Mary O
gave O
him O
a O
tin O
basin O
of O
water O
and O
a O
piece O
of O
soap, O
and O
he O
went O
outside O
the O
door O
and O
set O
the O
basin O
on O
a O
little O
bench O
there; O
then O
he O
dipped O
the O
soap O
in O
the O
water O
and O
laid O
it O
down; O
turned O
up O
his O
sleeves; O
poured O
out O
the O
water O
on O
the O
ground, O
gently, O
and O
then O
entered O
the O
kitchen O
and O
began O
to O
wipe O
his O
face O
diligently O
on O
the O
towel O
behind O
the O
door. O
But O
Mary Entity
removed O
the O
towel O
and O
said: Cue
"Now Quotation
ain't Quotation
you Quotation
ashamed, Quotation
Tom. Quotation
You Quotation
mustn't Quotation
be Quotation
so Quotation
bad. Quotation
Water Quotation
won't Quotation
hurt Quotation
you." Quotation
Tom Entity
was O
a O
trifle O
disconcerted. O
The O
basin O
was O
refilled, O
and O
this O
time O
he O
stood O
over O
it O
a O
little O
while, O
gathering O
resolution; O
took O
in O
a O
big O
breath O
and O
began. O
When O
he O
entered O
the O
kitchen O
presently, O
with O
both O
eyes O
shut O
and O
groping O
for O
the O
towel O
with O
his O
hands, O
an O
honorable O
testimony O
of O
suds O
and O
water O
was O
dripping O
from O
his O
face. O
But O
when O
he O
emerged O
from O
the O
towel, O
he O
was O
not O
yet O
satisfactory, O
for O
the O
clean O
territory O
stopped O
short O
at O
his O
chin O
and O
his O
jaws, O
like O
a O
mask; O
below O
and O
beyond O
this O
line O
there O
was O
a O
dark O
expanse O
of O
unirrigated O
soil O
that O
spread O
downward O
in O
front O
and O
backward O
around O
his O
neck. O
Mary O
took O
him O
in O
hand, O
and O
when O
she O
was O
done O
with O
him O
he O
was O
a O
man O
and O
a O
brother, O
without O
distinction O
of O
color, O
and O
his O
saturated O
hair O
was O
neatly O
brushed, O
and O
its O
short O
curls O
wrought O
into O
a O
dainty O
and O
symmetrical O
general O
effect. O
[He O
privately O
smoothed O
out O
the O
curls, O
with O
labor O
and O
difficulty, O
and O
plastered O
his O
hair O
close O
down O
to O
his O
head; O
for O
he O
held O
curls O
to O
be O
effeminate, O
and O
his O
own O
filled O
his O
life O
with O
bitterness.] O
Then O
Mary O
got O
out O
a O
suit O
of O
his O
clothing O
that O
had O
been O
used O
only O
on O
Sundays O
during O
two O
years-- O
they O
were O
simply O
called O
his O
"other O
clothes"-- O
and O
so O
by O
that O
we O
know O
the O
size O
of O
his O
wardrobe. O
The O
girl O
"put O
him O
to O
rights" O
after O
he O
had O
dressed O
himself; O
she O
buttoned O
his O
neat O
roundabout O
up O
to O
his O
chin, O
turned O
his O
vast O
shirt O
collar O
down O
over O
his O
shoulders, O
brushed O
him O
off O
and O
crowned O
him O
with O
his O
speckled O
straw O
hat. O
He O
now O
looked O
exceedingly O
improved O
and O
uncomfortable. O
He O
was O
fully O
as O
uncomfortable O
as O
he O
looked; O
for O
there O
was O
a O
restraint O
about O
whole O
clothes O
and O
cleanliness O
that O
galled O
him. O
He O
hoped O
that O
Mary O
would O
forget O
his O
shoes, O
but O
the O
hope O
was O
blighted; O
she O
coated O
them O
thoroughly O
with O
tallow, O
as O
was O
the O
custom, O
and O
brought O
them O
out. O
He Entity
lost O
his O
temper O
and O
said Cue
he Quotation
was Quotation
always Quotation
being Quotation
made Quotation
to Quotation
do Quotation
everything Quotation
he Quotation
didn't Quotation
want Quotation
to Quotation
do. Quotation
But O
Mary Entity
said, Cue
persuasively: O
"Please, Quotation
Tom-- Quotation
that's Quotation
a Quotation
good Quotation
boy." Quotation
So O
he O
got O
into O
the O
shoes O
snarling. O
Mary O
was O
soon O
ready, O
and O
the O
three O
children O
set O
out O
for O
Sunday-school O
-- O
a O
place O
that O
Tom O
hated O
with O
his O
whole O
heart; O
but O
Sid O
and O
Mary O
were O
fond O
of O
it. O
Sabbath-school O
hours O
were O
from O
nine O
to O
half-past O
ten; O
and O
then O
church O
service. O
Two O
of O
the O
children O
always O
remained O
for O
the O
sermon O
voluntarily, O
and O
the O
other O
always O
remained O
too-- O
for O
stronger O
reasons. O
The O
church's O
high-backed, O
uncushioned O
pews O
would O
seat O
about O
three O
hundred O
persons; O
the O
edifice O
was O
but O
a O
small, O
plain O
affair, O
with O
a O
sort O
of O
pine O
board O
tree-box O
on O
top O
of O
it O
for O
a O
steeple. O
At O
the O
door O
Tom Entity
dropped O
back O
a O
step O
and O
accosted Cue
a Entity
Sunday-dressed Entity
comrade: Entity
"Say, Quotation
Billy, Quotation
got Quotation
a Quotation
yaller Quotation
ticket?" Quotation
"Yes." Quotation
"What'll Quotation
you Quotation
take Quotation
for Quotation
her?" Quotation
"What'll Quotation
you Quotation
give?" Quotation
"Piece Quotation
of Quotation
lickrish Quotation
and Quotation
a Quotation
fish-hook." Quotation
"Less Quotation
see Quotation
'em." Quotation
Tom O
exhibited. O
They O
were O
satisfactory, O
and O
the O
property O
changed O
hands. O
Then O
Tom O
traded O
a O
couple O
of O
white O
alleys O
for O
three O
red O
tickets, O
and O
some O
small O
trifle O
or O
other O
for O
a O
couple O
of O
blue O
ones. O
He O
waylaid O
other O
boys O
as O
they O
came, O
and O
went O
on O
buying O
tickets O
of O
various O
colors O
ten O
or O
fifteen O
minutes O
longer. O
He O
entered O
the O
church, O
now, O
with O
a O
swarm O
of O
clean O
and O
noisy O
boys O
and O
girls, O
proceeded O
to O
his O
seat O
and O
started O
a O
quarrel O
with O
the O
first O
boy O
that O
came O
handy. O
The O
teacher, O
a O
grave, O
elderly O
man, O
interfered; O
then O
turned O
his O
back O
a O
moment O
and O
Tom O
pulled O
a O
boy's O
hair O
in O
the O
next O
bench, O
and O
was O
absorbed O
in O
his O
book O
when O
the O
boy O
turned O
around; O
stuck O
a O
pin O
in O
another O
boy, O
presently, O
in O
order O
to O
hear O
him Entity
say Cue
"Ouch!" Quotation
and O
got O
a O
new O
reprimand O
from O
his O
teacher. O
Tom's O
whole O
class O
were O
of O
a O
pattern-- O
restless, O
noisy, O
and O
troublesome. O
When O
they O
came O
to O
recite O
their O
lessons, O
not O
one O
of O
them O
knew O
his O
verses O
perfectly, O
but O
had O
to O
be O
prompted O
all O
along. O
However, O
they O
worried O
through, O
and O
each O
got O
his O
reward-- O
in O
small O
blue O
tickets, O
each O
with O
a O
passage O
of O
Scripture O
on O
it; O
each O
blue O
ticket O
was O
pay O
for O
two O
verses O
of O
the O
recitation. O
Ten O
blue O
tickets O
equalled O
a O
red O
one, O
and O
could O
be O
exchanged O
for O
it; O
ten O
red O
tickets O
equalled O
a O
yellow O
one; O
for O
ten O
yellow O
tickets O
the O
superintendent O
gave O
a O
very O
plainly O
bound O
Bible O
(worth O
forty O
cents O
in O
those O
easy O
times) O
to O
the O
pupil. O
How O
many O
of O
my O
readers O
would O
have O
the O
industry O
and O
application O
to O
memorize O
two O
thousand O
verses, O
even O
for O
a O
Dore O
Bible? O
And O
yet O
Mary O
had O
acquired O
two O
Bibles O
in O
this O
way-- O
it O
was O
the O
patient O
work O
of O
two O
years-- O
and O
a O
boy O
of O
German O
parentage O
had O
won O
four O
or O
five. O
He O
once O
recited O
three O
thousand O
verses O
without O
stopping; O
but O
the O
strain O
upon O
his O
mental O
faculties O
was O
too O
great, O
and O
he O
was O
little O
better O
than O
an O
idiot O
from O
that O
day O
forth O
-- O
a O
grievous O
misfortune O
for O
the O
school, O
for O
on O
great O
occasions, O
before O
company, O
the O
superintendent O
(as O
Tom O
expressed O
it) O
had O
always O
made O
this O
boy O
come O
out O
and O
"spread O
himself." O
Only O
the O
older O
pupils O
managed O
to O
keep O
their O
tickets O
and O
stick O
to O
their O
tedious O
work O
long O
enough O
to O
get O
a O
Bible, O
and O
so O
the O
delivery O
of O
one O
of O
these O
prizes O
was O
a O
rare O
and O
noteworthy O
circumstance; O
the O
successful O
pupil O
was O
so O
great O
and O
conspicuous O
for O
that O
day O
that O
on O
the O
spot O
every O
scholar's O
heart O
was O
fired O
with O
a O
fresh O
ambition O
that O
often O
lasted O
a O
couple O
of O
weeks. O
It O
is O
possible O
that O
Tom's O
mental O
stomach O
had O
never O
really O
hungered O
for O
one O
of O
those O
prizes, O
but O
unquestionably O
his O
entire O
being O
had O
for O
many O
a O
day O
longed O
for O
the O
glory O
and O
the O
eclat O
that O
came O
with O
it. O
In O
due O
course O
the O
superintendent O
stood O
up O
in O
front O
of O
the O
pulpit, O
with O
a O
closed O
hymn-book O
in O
his O
hand O
and O
his O
forefinger O
inserted O
between O
its O
leaves, O
and O
commanded O
attention. O
When O
a O
Sunday-school O
superintendent O
makes O
his O
customary O
little O
speech, O
a O
hymn-book O
in O
the O
hand O
is O
as O
necessary O
as O
is O
the O
inevitable O
sheet O
of O
music O
in O
the O
hand O
of O
a O
singer O
who O
stands O
forward O
on O
the O
platform O
and O
sings O
a O
solo O
at O
a O
concert O
--though O
why, O
is O
a O
mystery: O
for O
neither O
the O
hymn-book O
nor O
the O
sheet O
of O
music O
is O
ever O
referred O
to O
by O
the O
sufferer. O
This O
superintendent O
was O
a O
slim O
creature O
of O
thirty-five, O
with O
a O
sandy O
goatee O
and O
short O
sandy O
hair; O
he O
wore O
a O
stiff O
standing-collar O
whose O
upper O
edge O
almost O
reached O
his O
ears O
and O
whose O
sharp O
points O
curved O
forward O
abreast O
the O
corners O
of O
his O
mouth O
-- O
a O
fence O
that O
compelled O
a O
straight O
lookout O
ahead, O
and O
a O
turning O
of O
the O
whole O
body O
when O
a O
side O
view O
was O
required; O
his O
chin O
was O
propped O
on O
a O
spreading O
cravat O
which O
was O
as O
broad O
and O
as O
long O
as O
a O
bank-note, O
and O
had O
fringed O
ends; O
his O
boot O
toes O
were O
turned O
sharply O
up, O
in O
the O
fashion O
of O
the O
day, O
like O
sleigh-runners-- O
an O
effect O
patiently O
and O
laboriously O
produced O
by O
the O
young O
men O
by O
sitting O
with O
their O
toes O
pressed O
against O
a O
wall O
for O
hours O
together. O
Mr. O
Walters O
was O
very O
earnest O
of O
mien, O
and O
very O
sincere O
and O
honest O
at O
heart; O
and O
he O
held O
sacred O
things O
and O
places O
in O
such O
reverence, O
and O
so O
separated O
them O
from O
worldly O
matters, O
that O
unconsciously O
to O
himself O
his O
Sunday-school O
voice O
had O
acquired O
a O
peculiar O
intonation O
which O
was O
wholly O
absent O
on O
week-days. O
He Entity
began Cue
after O
this O
fashion: O
"Now, Quotation
children, Quotation
I Quotation
want Quotation
you Quotation
all Quotation
to Quotation
sit Quotation
up Quotation
just Quotation
as Quotation
straight Quotation
and Quotation
pretty Quotation
as Quotation
you Quotation
can Quotation
and Quotation
give Quotation
me Quotation
all Quotation
your Quotation
attention Quotation
for Quotation
a Quotation
minute Quotation
or Quotation
two. Quotation
There Quotation
--that Quotation
is Quotation
it. Quotation
That Quotation
is Quotation
the Quotation
way Quotation
good Quotation
little Quotation
boys Quotation
and Quotation
girls Quotation
should Quotation
do. Quotation
I Quotation
see Quotation
one Quotation
little Quotation
girl Quotation
who Quotation
is Quotation
looking Quotation
out Quotation
of Quotation
the Quotation
window Quotation
-- Quotation
I Quotation
am Quotation
afraid Quotation
she Quotation
thinks Quotation
I Quotation
am Quotation
out Quotation
there Quotation
somewhere-- Quotation
perhaps Quotation
up Quotation
in Quotation
one Quotation
of Quotation
the Quotation
trees Quotation
making Quotation
a Quotation
speech Quotation
to Quotation
the Quotation
little Quotation
birds. Quotation
[Applausive Quotation
titter.] Quotation
I Quotation
want Quotation
to Quotation
tell Quotation
you Quotation
how Quotation
good Quotation
it Quotation
makes Quotation
me Quotation
feel Quotation
to Quotation
see Quotation
so Quotation
many Quotation
bright, Quotation
clean Quotation
little Quotation
faces Quotation
assembled Quotation
in Quotation
a Quotation
place Quotation
like Quotation
this, Quotation
learning Quotation
to Quotation
do Quotation
right Quotation
and Quotation
be Quotation
good." Quotation
And O
so O
forth O
and O
so O
on. O
It O
is O
not O
necessary O
to O
set O
down O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
oration. O
It O
was O
of O
a O
pattern O
which O
does O
not O
vary, O
and O
so O
it O
is O
familiar O
to O
us Entity
all. Entity
The O
latter O
third O
of O
the O
speech O
was O
marred O
by O
the O
resumption O
of O
fights O
and O
other O
recreations O
among O
certain O
of O
the O
bad O
boys, O
and O
by O
fidgetings O
and O
whisperings O
that O
extended O
far O
and O
wide, O
washing O
even O
to O
the O
bases O
of O
isolated O
and O
incorruptible O
rocks O
like O
Sid O
and O
Mary. O
But O
now O
every O
sound O
ceased O
suddenly, O
with O
the O
subsidence O
of O
Mr. O
Walters' O
voice, O
and O
the O
conclusion O
of O
the O
speech O
was O
received O
with O
a O
burst O
of O
silent O
gratitude. O
A O
good O
part O
of O
the O
whispering O
had O
been O
occasioned O
by O
an O
event O
which O
was O
more O
or O
less O
rare-- O
the O
entrance O
of O
visitors: O
lawyer O
Thatcher, O
accompanied O
by O
a O
very O
feeble O
and O
aged O
man; O
a O
fine, O
portly, O
middle-aged O
gentleman O
with O
iron-gray O
hair; O
and O
a O
dignified O
lady O
who O
was O
doubtless O
the O
latter's O
wife. O
The O
lady O
was O
leading O
a O
child. O
Tom O
had O
been O
restless O
and O
full O
of O
chafings O
and O
repinings; O
conscience-smitten, O
too-- O
he O
could O
not O
meet O
Amy O
Lawrence's O
eye, O
he O
could O
not O
brook O
her O
loving O
gaze. O
But O
when O
he O
saw O
this O
small O
new-comer O
his O
soul O
was O
all O
ablaze O
with O
bliss O
in O
a O
moment. O
The O
next O
moment O
he O
was O
"showing O
off" O
with O
all O
his O
might O
--cuffing O
boys, O
pulling O
hair, O
making O
faces-- O
in O
a O
word, O
using O
every O
art O
that O
seemed O
likely O
to O
fascinate O
a O
girl O
and O
win O
her O
applause. O
His O
exaltation O
had O
but O
one O
alloy-- O
the O
memory O
of O
his O
humiliation O
in O
this O
angel's O
garden-- O
and O
that O
record O
in O
sand O
was O
fast O
washing O
out, O
under O
the O
waves O
of O
happiness O
that O
were O
sweeping O
over O
it O
now. O
The O
visitors O
were O
given O
the O
highest O
seat O
of O
honor, O
and O
as O
soon O
as O
Mr. O
Walters' O
speech O
was O
finished, O
he O
introduced O
them O
to O
the O
school. O
The O
middle-aged O
man O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
a O
prodigious O
personage-- O
no O
less O
a O
one O
than O
the O
county O
judge-- O
altogether O
the O
most O
august O
creation O
these O
children O
had O
ever O
looked O
upon-- O
and O
they O
wondered O
what O
kind O
of O
material O
he O
was O
made O
of-- O
and O
they O
half O
wanted O
to O
hear O
him O
roar, O
and O
were O
half O
afraid O
he O
might, O
too. O
He O
was O
from O
Constantinople, O
twelve O
miles O
away-- O
so O
he O
had O
travelled, O
and O
seen O
the O
world-- O
these O
very O
eyes O
had O
looked O
upon O
the O
county O
court-house-- O
which O
was O
said O
to O
have O
a O
tin O
roof. O
The O
awe O
which O
these O
reflections O
inspired O
was O
attested O
by O
the O
impressive O
silence O
and O
the O
ranks O
of O
staring O
eyes. O
This O
was O
the O
great O
Judge O
Thatcher, O
brother O
of O
their O
own O
lawyer. O
Jeff O
Thatcher O
immediately O
went O
forward, O
to O
be O
familiar O
with O
the O
great O
man O
and O
be O
envied O
by O
the O
school. O
It O
would O
have O
been O
music O
to O
his O
soul O
to O
hear O
the O
whisperings: O
"Look Quotation
at Quotation
him, Quotation
Jim! Quotation
He's Quotation
a Quotation
going Quotation
up Quotation
there. Quotation
Say-- Quotation
look! Quotation
he's Quotation
a Quotation
going Quotation
to Quotation
shake Quotation
hands Quotation
with Quotation
him-- Quotation
he Quotation
IS Quotation
shaking Quotation
hands Quotation
with Quotation
him! Quotation
By Quotation
jings, Quotation
don't Quotation
you Quotation
wish Quotation
you Quotation
was Quotation
Jeff?" Quotation
Mr. O
Walters O
fell O
to O
"showing O
off," O
with O
all O
sorts O
of O
official O
bustlings O
and O
activities, O
giving O
orders, O
delivering O
judgments, O
discharging O
directions O
here, O
there, O
everywhere O
that O
he O
could O
find O
a O
target. O
The O
librarian O
"showed O
off"-- O
running O
hither O
and O
thither O
with O
his O
arms O
full O
of O
books O
and O
making O
a O
deal O
of O
the O
splutter O
and O
fuss O
that O
insect O
authority O
delights O
in. O
The O
young O
lady O
teachers O
"showed O
off" O
--bending O
sweetly O
over O
pupils O
that O
were O
lately O
being O
boxed, O
lifting O
pretty O
warning O
fingers O
at O
bad O
little O
boys O
and O
patting O
good O
ones O
lovingly. O
The O
young O
gentlemen O
teachers O
"showed O
off" O
with O
small O
scoldings O
and O
other O
little O
displays O
of O
authority O
and O
fine O
attention O
to O
discipline-- O
and O
most O
of O
the O
teachers, O
of O
both O
sexes, O
found O
business O
up O
at O
the O
library, O
by O
the O
pulpit; O
and O
it O
was O
business O
that O
frequently O
had O
to O
be O
done O
over O
again O
two O
or O
three O
times O
(with O
much O
seeming O
vexation). O
The O
little O
girls O
"showed O
off" O
in O
various O
ways, O
and O
the O
little O
boys O
"showed O
off" O
with O
such O
diligence O
that O
the O
air O
was O
thick O
with O
paper O
wads O
and O
the O
murmur O
of O
scufflings. O
And O
above O
it O
all O
the O
great O
man O
sat O
and O
beamed O
a O
majestic O
judicial O
smile O
upon O
all O
the O
house, O
and O
warmed O
himself O
in O
the O
sun O
of O
his O
own O
grandeur-- O
for O
he O
was O
"showing O
off," O
too. O
There O
was O
only O
one O
thing O
wanting O
to O
make O
Mr. O
Walters' O
ecstasy O
complete, O
and O
that O
was O
a O
chance O
to O
deliver O
a O
Bible-prize O
and O
exhibit O
a O
prodigy. O
Several O
pupils O
had O
a O
few O
yellow O
tickets, O
but O
none O
had O
enough O
--he O
had O
been O
around O
among O
the O
star O
pupils O
inquiring. O
He O
would O
have O
given O
worlds, O
now, O
to O
have O
that O
German O
lad O
back O
again O
with O
a O
sound O
mind. O
And O
now O
at O
this O
moment, O
when O
hope O
was O
dead, O
Tom O
Sawyer O
came O
forward O
with O
nine O
yellow O
tickets, O
nine O
red O
tickets, O
and O
ten O
blue O
ones, O
and O
demanded O
a O
Bible. O
This O
was O
a O
thunderbolt O
out O
of O
a O
clear O
sky. O
Walters O
was O
not O
expecting O
an O
application O
from O
this O
source O
for O
the O
next O
ten O
years. O
But O
there O
was O
no O
getting O
around O
it-- O
here O
were O
the O
certified O
checks, O
and O
they O
were O
good O
for O
their O
face. O
Tom O
was O
therefore O
elevated O
to O
a O
place O
with O
the O
Judge O
and O
the O
other O
elect, O
and O
the O
great O
news O
was O
announced O
from O
headquarters. O
It O
was O
the O
most O
stunning O
surprise O
of O
the O
decade, O
and O
so O
profound O
was O
the O
sensation O
that O
it O
lifted O
the O
new O
hero O
up O
to O
the O
judicial O
one's O
altitude, O
and O
the O
school O
had O
two O
marvels O
to O
gaze O
upon O
in O
place O
of O
one. O
The O
boys O
were O
all O
eaten O
up O
with O
envy-- O
but O
those O
that O
suffered O
the O
bitterest O
pangs O
were O
those O
who O
perceived O
too O
late O
that O
they O
themselves O
had O
contributed O
to O
this O
hated O
splendor O
by O
trading O
tickets O
to O
Tom O
for O
the O
wealth O
he O
had O
amassed O
in O
selling O
whitewashing O
privileges. O
These O
despised O
themselves, O
as O
being O
the O
dupes O
of O
a O
wily O
fraud, O
a O
guileful O
snake O
in O
the O
grass. O
The O
prize O
was O
delivered O
to O
Tom O
with O
as O
much O
effusion O
as O
the O
superintendent O
could O
pump O
up O
under O
the O
circumstances; O
but O
it O
lacked O
somewhat O
of O
the O
true O
gush, O
for O
the O
poor O
fellow's O
instinct O
taught O
him O
that O
there O
was O
a O
mystery O
here O
that O
could O
not O
well O
bear O
the O
light, O
perhaps; O
it O
was O
simply O
preposterous O
that O
this O
boy O
had O
warehoused O
two O
thousand O
sheaves O
of O
Scriptural O
wisdom O
on O
his O
premises O
-- O
a O
dozen O
would O
strain O
his O
capacity, O
without O
a O
doubt. O
Amy O
Lawrence O
was O
proud O
and O
glad, O
and O
she O
tried O
to O
make O
Tom O
see O
it O
in O
her O
face-- O
but O
he O
wouldn't O
look. O
She O
wondered; O
then O
she O
was O
just O
a O
grain O
troubled; O
next O
a O
dim O
suspicion O
came O
and O
went-- O
came O
again; O
she O
watched; O
a O
furtive O
glance O
told O
her O
worlds-- O
and O
then O
her O
heart O
broke, O
and O
she O
was O
jealous, O
and O
angry, O
and O
the O
tears O
came O
and O
she O
hated O
everybody. O
Tom O
most O
of O
all O
(she O
thought). O
Tom O
was O
introduced O
to O
the O
Judge; O
but O
his O
tongue O
was O
tied, O
his O
breath O
would O
hardly O
come, O
his O
heart O
quaked-- O
partly O
because O
of O
the O
awful O
greatness O
of O
the O
man, O
but O
mainly O
because O
he O
was O
her O
parent. O
He O
would O
have O
liked O
to O
fall O
down O
and O
worship O
him, O
if O
it O
were O
in O
the O
dark. O
The Entity
Judge Entity
put O
his O
hand O
on O
Tom's O
head O
and O
called O
him O
a O
fine O
little O
man, O
and O
asked Cue
him Entity
what Quotation
his Quotation
name Quotation
was. Quotation
The Entity
boy Entity
stammered, Cue
gasped, Cue
and Cue
got Cue
it Cue
out: Cue
"Tom." Quotation
"Oh, Quotation
no, Quotation
not Quotation
Tom-- Quotation
it Quotation
is Quotation
-- Quotation
" Quotation
"Thomas." Quotation
"Ah, Quotation
that's Quotation
it. Quotation
I Quotation
thought Quotation
there Quotation
was Quotation
more Quotation
to Quotation
it, Quotation
maybe. Quotation
That's Quotation
very Quotation
well. Quotation
But Quotation
you've Quotation
another Quotation
one Quotation
I Quotation
daresay, Quotation
and Quotation
you'll Quotation
tell Quotation
it Quotation
to Quotation
me, Quotation
won't Quotation
you?" Quotation
"Tell Quotation
the Quotation
gentleman Quotation
your Quotation
other Quotation
name, Quotation
Thomas," Quotation
said Cue
Walters, Entity
"and Quotation
say Quotation
sir. Quotation
You Quotation
mustn't Quotation
forget Quotation
your Quotation
manners." Quotation
"Thomas Quotation
Sawyer-- Quotation
sir." Quotation
"That's Quotation
it! Quotation
That's Quotation
a Quotation
good Quotation
boy. Quotation
Fine Quotation
boy. Quotation
Fine, Quotation
manly Quotation
little Quotation
fellow. Quotation
Two Quotation
thousand Quotation
verses Quotation
is Quotation
a Quotation
great Quotation
many-- Quotation
very, Quotation
very Quotation
great Quotation
many. Quotation
And Quotation
you Quotation
never Quotation
can Quotation
be Quotation
sorry Quotation
for Quotation
the Quotation
trouble Quotation
you Quotation
took Quotation
to Quotation
learn Quotation
them; Quotation
for Quotation
knowledge Quotation
is Quotation
worth Quotation
more Quotation
than Quotation
anything Quotation
there Quotation
is Quotation
in Quotation
the Quotation
world; Quotation
it's Quotation
what Quotation
makes Quotation
great Quotation
men Quotation
and Quotation
good Quotation
men; Quotation
you'll Quotation
be Quotation
a Quotation
great Quotation
man Quotation
and Quotation
a Quotation
good Quotation
man Quotation
yourself, Quotation
some Quotation
day, Quotation
Thomas, Quotation
and Quotation
then Quotation
you'll Quotation
look Quotation
back Quotation
and Quotation
say, Quotation
It's Quotation
all Quotation
owing Quotation
to Quotation
the Quotation
precious Quotation
Sunday-school Quotation
privileges Quotation
of Quotation
my Quotation
boyhood-- Quotation
it's Quotation
all Quotation
owing Quotation
to Quotation
my Quotation
dear Quotation
teachers Quotation
that Quotation
taught Quotation
me Quotation
to Quotation
learn-- Quotation
it's Quotation
all Quotation
owing Quotation
to Quotation
the Quotation
good Quotation
superintendent, Quotation
who Quotation
encouraged Quotation
me, Quotation
and Quotation
watched Quotation
over Quotation
me, Quotation
and Quotation
gave Quotation
me Quotation
a Quotation
beautiful Quotation
Bible Quotation
-- Quotation
a Quotation
splendid Quotation
elegant Quotation
Bible-- Quotation
to Quotation
keep Quotation
and Quotation
have Quotation
it Quotation
all Quotation
for Quotation
my Quotation
own, Quotation
always-- Quotation
it's Quotation
all Quotation
owing Quotation
to Quotation
right Quotation
bringing Quotation
up! Quotation
That Quotation
is Quotation
what Quotation
you Quotation
will Quotation
say, Quotation
Thomas-- Quotation
and Quotation
you Quotation
wouldn't Quotation
take Quotation
any Quotation
money Quotation
for Quotation
those Quotation
two Quotation
thousand Quotation
verses-- Quotation

indeed Quotation
you Quotation

And Quotation
now Quotation
you Quotation
wouldn't Quotation
mind Quotation
telling Quotation
me Quotation
and Quotation
this Quotation
lady Quotation
some Quotation
of Quotation
the Quotation
things Quotation
you've Quotation
learned-- Quotation
no, Quotation
I Quotation
know Quotation
you Quotation
wouldn't-- Quotation
for Quotation
we Quotation
are Quotation
proud Quotation
of Quotation
little Quotation
boys Quotation
that Quotation
learn. Quotation
Now, Quotation
no Quotation
doubt Quotation
you Quotation
know Quotation
the Quotation
names Quotation
of Quotation
all Quotation
the Quotation
twelve Quotation
disciples. Quotation
Won't Quotation
you Quotation
tell Quotation
us Quotation
the Quotation
names Quotation
of Quotation
the Quotation
first Quotation
two Quotation
that Quotation
were Quotation
appointed?" Quotation
Tom O
was O
tugging O
at O
a O
button-hole O
and O
looking O
sheepish. O
He O
blushed, O
now, O
and O
his O
eyes O
fell. O
Mr. O
Walters' O
heart O
sank O
within O
him. O
He O
said O
to O
himself, O
it O
is O
not O
possible O
that O
the O
boy O
can O
answer O
the O
simplest O
question-- O
why O
DID O
the O
Judge O
ask O
him? O
Yet O
he Entity
felt O
obliged O
to O
speak O
up O
and O
say: Cue
"Answer Quotation
the Quotation
gentleman, Quotation
Thomas-- Quotation
don't Quotation
be Quotation
afraid." Quotation
Tom Entity
still O
hung O
fire. O
"Now Quotation
I Quotation
know Quotation
you'll Quotation
tell Quotation
me," Quotation
said Cue
the Entity
lady. Entity
"The Quotation
names Quotation
of Quotation
the Quotation
first Quotation
two Quotation

were Quotation
-- Quotation
" Quotation
"DAVID Quotation
AND Quotation
GOLIAH!" Quotation
Let O
us O
draw O
the O
curtain O
of O
charity O
over O
the O
rest O
of O

scene. O
CHAPTER O
V O
ABOUT O
half-past O
ten O
the O
cracked O
bell O
of O
the O
small O
church O
began O
to O
ring, O
and O
presently O
the O
people O
began O
to O
gather O
for O
the O
morning O
sermon. O
The O
Sunday-school O
children O
distributed O
themselves O
about O
the O
house O
and O
occupied O
pews O
with O
their O
parents, O
so O
as O
to O
be O
under O
supervision. O
Aunt O
Polly O
came, O
and O
Tom O
and O
Sid O
and O
Mary O
sat O
with O
her-- O
Tom O
being O
placed O
next O
the O
aisle, O
in O
order O
that O
he O
might O
be O
as O
far O
away O
from O
the O
open O
window O
and O
the O
seductive O
outside O
summer O
scenes O
as O
possible. O
The O
crowd O
filed O
up O
the O
aisles: O
the O
aged O
and O
needy O
postmaster, O
who O
had O
seen O
better O
days; O
the O
mayor O
and O
his O
wife-- O
for O
they O
had O
a O
mayor O
there, O
among O
other O
unnecessaries; O
the O
justice O
of O
the O
peace; O
the O
widow O
Douglass, O
fair, O
smart, O
and O
forty, O
a O
generous, O
good-hearted O
soul O
and O
well-to-do, O
her O
hill O
mansion O
the O
only O
palace O
in O
the O
town, O
and O
the O
most O
hospitable O
and O
much O
the O
most O
lavish O
in O
the O
matter O
of O
festivities O
that O
St. O
Petersburg O
could O
boast; O
the O
bent O
and O
venerable O
Major O
and O
Mrs. O
Ward; O
lawyer O
Riverson, O
the O
new O
notable O
from O
a O
distance; O
next O
the O
belle O
of O
the O
village, O
followed O
by O
a O
troop O
of O
lawn-clad O
and O
ribbon-decked O
young O
heart-breakers; O
then O
all O
the O
young O
clerks O
in O
town O
in O
a O
body-- O
for O
they O
had O
stood O
in O
the O
vestibule O
sucking O
their O
cane-heads, O
a O
circling O
wall O
of O
oiled O
and O
simpering O
admirers, O
till O
the O
last O
girl O
had O
run O
their O
gantlet; O
and O
last O
of O
all O
came O
the O
Model O
Boy, O
Willie O
Mufferson, O
taking O
as O
heedful O
care O
of O
his O
mother O
as O
if O
she O
were O
cut O
glass. O
He O
always O
brought O
his O
mother O
to O
church, O
and O
was O
the O
pride O
of O
all O
the O
matrons. O
The O
boys O
all O
hated O
him, O
he O
was O
so O
good. O
And O
besides, O
he O
had O
been O
"thrown O
up O
to O
them" O
so O
much. O
His O
white O
handkerchief O
was O
hanging O
out O
of O
his O
pocket O
behind, O
as O
usual O
on O
Sundays-- O
accidentally. O
Tom O
had O
no O
handkerchief, O
and O
he O
looked O
upon O
boys O
who O
had O
as O
snobs. O
The O
congregation O
being O
fully O
assembled, O
now, O
the O
bell O
rang O
once O
more, O
to O
warn O
laggards O
and O
stragglers, O
and O
then O
a O
solemn O
hush O
fell O
upon O
the O
church O
which O
was O
only O
broken O
by O
the O
tittering O
and O
whispering O
of O
the O
choir O
in O
the O
gallery. O
The O
choir O
always O
tittered O
and O
whispered O
all O
through O
service. O
There O
was O
once O
a O
church O
choir O
that O
was O
not O
ill-bred, O
but O
I O
have O
forgotten O
where O
it O
was, O
now. O
It O
was O
a O
great O
many O
years O
ago, O
and O
I O
can O
scarcely O
remember O
anything O
about O
it, O
but O
I O
think O
it O
was O
in O
some O
foreign O
country. O
The Entity
minister Entity
gave O
out O
the O
hymn, O
and O
read O
it O
through O
with O
a O
relish, O
in O
a O
peculiar O
style O
which O
was O
much O
admired O
in O
that O
part O
of O
the O
country. O
His O
voice O
began O
on O
a O
medium O
key O
and O
climbed O
steadily O
up O
till O
it O
reached O
a O
certain O
point, O
where O
it O
bore O
with O
strong O
emphasis O
upon O
the O
topmost O
word O
and O
then O
plunged O
down O
as O
if O
from O
a O
spring-board: O
Shall Quotation
I Quotation
be Quotation
car-ri-ed Quotation
toe Quotation
the Quotation
skies, Quotation
on Quotation
flow'ry Quotation
BEDS Quotation
of Quotation
ease, Quotation
Whilst Quotation
others Quotation
fight Quotation
to Quotation
win Quotation
the Quotation
prize, Quotation
and Quotation
sail Quotation
thro' Quotation
BLOODY Quotation
seas? Quotation
He O
was O
regarded O
as O
a O
wonderful O
reader. O
At O
church O
"sociables" O
he O
was O
always O
called O
upon O
to O
read O
poetry; O
and O
when O
he O
was O
through, O
the O
ladies O
would O
lift O
up O
their O
hands O
and O
let O
them O
fall O
helplessly O
in O
their O
laps, O
and O
"wall" O
their O
eyes, O
and O
shake O
their O
heads, O
as O
much O
as O
to O
say, O
"Words O
cannot O
express O
it; O
it O
is O
too O
beautiful, O
TOO O
beautiful O
for O
this O
mortal O
earth." O
After O
the O
hymn O
had O
been O
sung, O
the Entity
Rev. Entity
Mr. Entity
Sprague Entity
turned O
himself O
into O
a O
bulletin-board, O
and O
read Cue
off Cue
"notices" Quotation
of Quotation
meetings Quotation
and Quotation
societies Quotation
and Quotation
things Quotation
till O
it O
seemed O
that O
the O
list O
would O
stretch O
out O
to O
the O
crack O
of O
doom O
-- O
a O
queer O
custom O
which O
is O
still O
kept O
up O
in O
America, O
even O
in O
cities, O
away O
here O
in O
this O
age O
of O
abundant O
newspapers. O
Often, O
the O
less O
there O
is O
to O
justify O
a O
traditional O
custom, O
the O
harder O
it O
is O
to O
get O
rid O
of O
it. O
And O
now O
the O
minister O
prayed. O
A O
good, O
generous O
prayer O
it O
was, O
and O
went O
into O
details: O
it O
pleaded O
for O
the O
church, O
and O
the O
little O
children O
of O
the O
church; O
for O
the O
other O
churches O
of O
the O
village; O
for O
the O
village O
itself; O
for O
the O
county; O
for O
the O
State; O
for O
the O
State O
officers; O
for O
the O
United O
States; O
for O
the O
churches O
of O
the O
United O
States; O
for O
Congress; O
for O
the O
President; O
for O
the O
officers O
of O
the O
Government; O
for O
poor O
sailors, O
tossed O
by O
stormy O
seas; O
for O
the O
oppressed O
millions O
groaning O
under O
the O
heel O
of O
European O
monarchies O
and O
Oriental O
despotisms; O
for O
such O
as O
have O
the O
light O
and O
the O
good O
tidings, O
and O
yet O
have O
not O
eyes O
to O
see O
nor O
ears O
to O
hear O
withal; O
for O
the O
heathen O
in O
the O
far O
islands O
of O
the O
sea; O
and O
closed O
with O
a O
supplication O
that O
the O
words O
he O
was O
about O
to O
speak O
might O
find O
grace O
and O
favor, O
and O
be O
as O
seed O
sown O
in O
fertile O
ground, O
yielding O
in O
time O
a O
grateful O
harvest O
of O
good. O
Amen. O
There O
was O
a O
rustling O
of O
dresses, O
and O
the O
standing O
congregation O
sat O
down. O
The O
boy O
whose O
history O
this O
book O
relates O
did O
not O
enjoy O
the O
prayer, O
he O
only O
endured O
it-- O
if O
he O
even O
did O
that O
much. O
He O
was O
restive O
all O
through O
it; O
he O
kept O
tally O
of O
the O
details O
of O
the O
prayer, O
unconsciously O
--for O
he O
was O
not O
listening, O
but O
he O
knew O
the O
ground O
of O
old, O
and O
the O
clergyman's O
regular O
route O
over O
it-- O
and O
when O
a O
little O
trifle O
of O
new O
matter O
was O
interlarded, O
his O
ear O
detected O
it O
and O
his O
whole O
nature O
resented O
it; O
he O
considered O
additions O
unfair, O
and O
scoundrelly. O
In O
the O
midst O
of O
the O
prayer O
a O
fly O
had O
lit O
on O
the O
back O
of O
the O
pew O
in O
front O
of O
him O
and O
tortured O
his O
spirit O
by O
calmly O
rubbing O
its O
hands O
together, O
embracing O
its O
head O
with O
its O
arms, O
and O
polishing O
it O
so O
vigorously O
that O
it O
seemed O
to O
almost O
part O
company O
with O
the O
body, O
and O
the O
slender O
thread O
of O
a O
neck O
was O
exposed O
to O
view; O
scraping O
its O
wings O
with O
its O
hind O
legs O
and O
smoothing O
them O
to O
its O
body O
as O
if O
they O
had O
been O
coat-tails; O
going O
through O
its O
whole O
toilet O
as O
tranquilly O
as O
if O
it O
knew O
it O
was O
perfectly O
safe. O
As O
indeed O
it O
was; O
for O
as O
sorely O
as O
Tom's O
hands O
itched O
to O
grab O
for O
it O
they O
did O
not O
dare-- O
he O
believed O
his O
soul O
would O
be O
instantly O
destroyed O
if O
he O
did O
such O
a O
thing O
while O
the O
prayer O
was O
going O
on. O
But O
with O
the O
closing O
sentence O
his O
hand O
began O
to O
curve O
and O
steal O
forward; O
and O
the O
instant O
the O
"Amen" O
was O
out O
the O
fly O
was O
a O
prisoner O
of O
war. O
His O
aunt O
detected O
the O
act O
and O
made O
him O
let O
it O
go. O
The O
minister O
gave O
out O
his O
text O
and O
droned O
along O
monotonously O
through O
an O
argument O
that O
was O
so O
prosy O
that O
many O
a O
head O
by O
and O
by O
began O
to O
nod O
--and O
yet O
it O
was O
an O
argument O
that O
dealt O
in O
limitless O
fire O
and O
brimstone O
and O
thinned O
the O
predestined O
elect O
down O
to O
a O
company O
so O
small O
as O
to O
be O
hardly O
worth O
the O
saving. O
Tom O
counted O
the O
pages O
of O
the O
sermon; O
after O
church O
he O
always O
knew O
how O
many O
pages O
there O
had O
been, O
but O
he O
seldom O
knew O
anything O
else O
about O
the O
discourse. O
However, O
this O
time O
he O
was O
really O
interested O
for O
a O
little O
while. O
The O
minister O
made O
a O
grand O
and O
moving O
picture O
of O
the O
assembling O
together O
of O
the O
world's O
hosts O
at O
the O
millennium O
when O
the O
lion O
and O
the O
lamb O
should O
lie O
down O
together O
and O
a O
little O
child O
should O
lead O
them. O
But O
the O
pathos, O
the O
lesson, O
the O
moral O
of O
the O
great O
spectacle O
were O
lost O
upon O
the O
boy; O
he O
only O
thought O
of O
the O
conspicuousness O
of O
the O
principal O
character O
before O
the O
on-looking O
nations; O
his O
face O
lit O
with O
the O
thought, O
and O
he O
said O
to O
himself O
that O
he O
wished O
he O
could O
be O
that O
child, O
if O
it O
was O
a O
tame O
lion. O
Now O
he O
lapsed O
into O
suffering O
again, O
as O
the O
dry O
argument O
was O
resumed. O
Presently O
he O
bethought O
him O
of O
a O
treasure O
he O
had O
and O
got O
it O
out. O
It O
was O
a O
large O
black O
beetle O
with O
formidable O
jaws O
-- O
a O
"pinchbug," O
he O
called O
it. O
It O
was O
in O
a O
percussion-cap O
box. O
The O
first O
thing O
the O
beetle O
did O
was O
to O
take O
him O
by O
the O
finger. O
A O
natural O
fillip O
followed, O
the O
beetle O
went O
floundering O
into O
the O
aisle O
and O
lit O
on O
its O
back, O
and O
the O
hurt O
finger O
went O
into O
the O
boy's O
mouth. O
The O
beetle O
lay O
there O
working O
its O
helpless O
legs, O
unable O
to O
turn O
over. O
Tom O
eyed O
it, O
and O
longed O
for O
it; O
but O
it O
was O
safe O
out O
of O
his O
reach. O
Other O
people O
uninterested O
in O
the O
sermon O
found O
relief O
in O
the O
beetle, O
and O
they O
eyed O
it O
too. O
Presently O
a O
vagrant O
poodle O
dog O
came O
idling O
along, O
sad O
at O
heart, O
lazy O
with O
the O
summer O
softness O
and O
the O
quiet, O
weary O
of O
captivity, O
sighing O
for O
change. O
He O
spied O
the O
beetle; O
the O
drooping O
tail O
lifted O
and O
wagged. O
He O
surveyed O
the O
prize; O
walked O
around O
it; O
smelt O
at O
it O
from O
a O
safe O
distance; O
walked O
around O
it O
again; O
grew O
bolder, O
and O
took O
a O
closer O
smell; O
then O
lifted O
his O
lip O
and O
made O
a O
gingerly O
snatch O
at O
it, O
just O
missing O
it; O
made O
another, O
and O
another; O
began O
to O
enjoy O
the O
diversion; O
subsided O
to O
his O
stomach O
with O
the O
beetle O
between O
his O
paws, O
and O
continued O
his O
experiments; O
grew O
weary O
at O
last, O
and O
then O
indifferent O
and O
absent-minded. O
His O
head O
nodded, O
and O
little O
by O
little O
his O
chin O
descended O
and O
touched O
the O
enemy, O
who O
seized O
it. O
There O
was O
a O
sharp O
yelp, O
a O
flirt O
of O
the O
poodle's O
head, O
and O
the O
beetle O
fell O
a O
couple O
of O
yards O
away, O
and O
lit O
on O
its O
back O
once O
more. O
The O
neighboring O
spectators O
shook O
with O
a O
gentle O
inward O
joy, O
several O
faces O
went O
behind O
fans O
and O
handkerchiefs, O
and O
Tom O
was O
entirely O
happy. O
The O
dog O
looked O
foolish, O
and O
probably O
felt O
so; O
but O
there O
was O
resentment O
in O
his O
heart, O
too, O
and O
a O
craving O
for O
revenge. O
So O
he O
went O
to O
the O
beetle O
and O
began O
a O
wary O
attack O
on O
it O
again; O
jumping O
at O
it O
from O
every O
point O
of O
a O
circle, O
lighting O
with O
his O
fore-paws O
within O
an O
inch O
of O
the O
creature, O
making O
even O
closer O
snatches O
at O
it O
with O
his O
teeth, O
and O
jerking O
his O
head O
till O
his O
ears O
flapped O
again. O
But O
he O
grew O
tired O
once O
more, O
after O
a O
while; O
tried O
to O
amuse O
himself O
with O
a O
fly O
but O
found O
no O
relief; O
followed O
an O
ant O
around, O
with O
his O
nose O
close O
to O
the O
floor, O
and O
quickly O
wearied O
of O
that; O
yawned, O
sighed, O
forgot O
the O
beetle O
entirely, O
and O
sat O
down O
on O
it. O
Then O
there O
was O
a O
wild O
yelp O
of O
agony O
and O
the O
poodle O
went O
sailing O
up O
the O
aisle; O
the O
yelps O
continued, O
and O
so O
did O
the O
dog; O
he O
crossed O
the O
house O
in O
front O
of O
the O
altar; O
he O
flew O
down O
the O
other O
aisle; O
he O
crossed O
before O
the O
doors; O
he O
clamored O
up O
the O
home-stretch; O
his O
anguish O
grew O
with O
his O
progress, O
till O
presently O
he O
was O
but O
a O
woolly O
comet O
moving O
in O
its O
orbit O
with O
the O
gleam O
and O
the O
speed O
of O
light. O
At O
last O
the O
frantic O
sufferer O
sheered O
from O
its O
course, O
and O
sprang O
into O
its O
master's O
lap; O
he O
flung O
it O
out O
of O
the O
window, O
and O
the O
voice O
of O
distress O
quickly O
thinned O
away O
and O
died O
in O
the O
distance. O
By O
this O
time O
the O
whole O
church O
was O
red-faced O
and O
suffocating O
with O
suppressed O
laughter, O
and O
the O
sermon O
had O
come O
to O
a O
dead O
standstill. O
The O
discourse O
was O
resumed O
presently, O
but O
it O
went O
lame O
and O
halting, O
all O
possibility O
of O
impressiveness O
being O
at O
an O
end; O
for O
even O
the O
gravest O
sentiments O
were O
constantly O
being O
received O
with O
a O
smothered O
burst O
of O
unholy O
mirth, O
under O
cover O
of O
some O
remote O
pew-back, O
as O
if O
the O
poor O
parson O
had O
said O
a O
rarely O
facetious O
thing. O
It O
was O
a O
genuine O
relief O
to O
the O
whole O
congregation O
when O
the O
ordeal O
was O
over O
and O
the O
benediction O
pronounced. O
Tom O
Sawyer O
went O
home O
quite O
cheerful, O
thinking O
to O
himself O
that O
there O
was O
some O
satisfaction O
about O
divine O
service O
when O
there O
was O
a O
bit O
of O
variety O
in O
it. O
He O
had O
but O
one O
marring O
thought; O
he O
was O
willing O
that O
the O
dog O
should O
play O
with O
his O
pinchbug, O
but O
he O
did O
not O
think O
it O
was O
upright O
in O
him O
to O
carry O
it O
off. O
CHAPTER O
VI O
MONDAY O
morning O
found O
Tom O
Sawyer O
miserable. O
Monday O
morning O
always O
found O
him O
so-- O
because O
it O
began O
another O
week's O
slow O
suffering O
in O
school. O
He O
generally O
began O
that O
day O
with O
wishing O
he O
had O
had O
no O
intervening O
holiday, O
it O
made O
the O
going O
into O
captivity O
and O
fetters O
again O
so O
much O
more O
odious. O
Tom O
lay O
thinking. O
Presently O
it O
occurred O
to O
him O
that O
he O
wished O
he O
was O
sick; O
then O
he O
could O
stay O
home O
from O
school. O
Here O
was O
a O
vague O
possibility. O
He O
canvassed O
his O
system. O
No O
ailment O
was O
found, O
and O
he O
investigated O
again. O
This O
time O
he O
thought O
he O
could O
detect O
colicky O
symptoms, O
and O
he O
began O
to O
encourage O
them O
with O
considerable O
hope. O
But O
they O
soon O
grew O
feeble, O
and O
presently O
died O
wholly O
away. O
He O
reflected O
further. O
Suddenly O
he O
discovered O
something. O
One O
of O
his O
upper O
front O
teeth O
was O
loose. O
This O
was O
lucky; O
he O
was O
about O
to O
begin O
to O
groan, O
as O
a O
"starter," O
as O
he O
called O
it, O
when O
it O
occurred O
to O
him O
that O
if O
he O
came O
into O
court O
with O
that O
argument, O
his O
aunt O
would O
pull O
it O
out, O
and O
that O
would O
hurt. O
So O
he O
thought O
he O
would O
hold O
the O
tooth O
in O
reserve O
for O
the O
present, O
and O
seek O
further. O
Nothing O
offered O
for O
some O
little O
time, O
and O
then O
he O
remembered O
hearing O
the O
doctor O
tell O
about O
a O
certain O
thing O
that O
laid O
up O
a O
patient O
for O
two O
or O
three O
weeks O
and O
threatened O
to O
make O
him O
lose O
a O
finger. O
So O
the O
boy O
eagerly O
drew O
his O
sore O
toe O
from O
under O
the O
sheet O
and O
held O
it O
up O
for O
inspection. O
But O
now O
he O
did O
not O
know O
the O
necessary O
symptoms. O
However, O
it O
seemed O
well O
worth O
while O
to O
chance O
it, O
so O
he O
fell O
to O
groaning O
with O
considerable O
spirit. O
But O
Sid O
slept O
on O
unconscious. O
Tom O
groaned O
louder, O
and O
fancied O
that O
he O
began O
to O
feel O
pain O
in O
the O
toe. O
No O
result O
from O
Sid. O
Tom O
was O
panting O
with O
his O
exertions O
by O
this O
time. O
He O
took O
a O
rest O
and O
then O
swelled O
himself O
up O
and O
fetched O
a O
succession O
of O
admirable O
groans. O
Sid O
snored O
on. O
Tom O
was O
aggravated. O
He Entity
said, Cue
"Sid, Quotation
Sid!" Quotation
and O
shook O
him. Entity
This O
course O
worked O
well, O
and O
Tom O
began O
to O
groan O
again. O
Sid O
yawned, O
stretched, O
then O
brought O
himself O
up O
on O
his O
elbow O
with O
a O
snort, O
and O
began O
to O
stare O
at O
Tom. O
Tom Entity
went O
on O
groaning. O
Sid Entity
said: Cue
"Tom! Quotation
Say, Quotation
Tom!" Quotation
[No O
response.] O
"Here, Quotation
Tom! Quotation
TOM! Quotation
What Quotation
is Quotation
the Quotation
matter, Quotation
Tom?" Quotation
And O
he Entity
shook O
him O
and O
looked O
in O
his O
face O
anxiously. O
Tom Entity
moaned Cue
out: Cue
"Oh, Quotation
don't, Quotation
Sid. Quotation
Don't Quotation
joggle Quotation
me." Quotation
"Why, Quotation
what's Quotation
the Quotation
matter, Quotation
Tom? Quotation
I Quotation
must Quotation
call Quotation
auntie." Quotation
"No-- Quotation
never Quotation
mind. Quotation
It'll Quotation
be Quotation
over Quotation
by Quotation
and Quotation
by, Quotation
maybe. Quotation
Don't Quotation
call Quotation
anybody." Quotation
"But Quotation
I Quotation
must! Quotation
DON'T Quotation
groan Quotation
so, Quotation
Tom, Quotation
it's Quotation
awful. Quotation
How Quotation
long Quotation
you Quotation
been Quotation
this Quotation
way?" Quotation
"Hours. Quotation
Ouch! Quotation
Oh, Quotation
don't Quotation
stir Quotation
so, Quotation
Sid, Quotation
you'll Quotation
kill Quotation
me." Quotation
"Tom, Quotation
why Quotation
didn't Quotation
you Quotation
wake Quotation
me Quotation
sooner? Quotation
Oh, Quotation
Tom, Quotation
DON'T! Quotation
It Quotation
makes Quotation
my Quotation
flesh Quotation
crawl Quotation
to Quotation
hear Quotation
you. Quotation
Tom, Quotation
what Quotation
is Quotation
the Quotation
matter?" Quotation
"I Quotation
forgive Quotation
you Quotation
everything, Quotation
Sid. Quotation
[Groan.] Quotation
Everything Quotation
you've Quotation
ever Quotation
done Quotation
to Quotation
me. Quotation
When Quotation
I'm Quotation
gone Quotation
-- Quotation
" Quotation
"Oh, Quotation
Tom, Quotation
you Quotation
ain't Quotation
dying, Quotation
are Quotation
you? Quotation
Don't, Quotation
Tom-- Quotation
oh, Quotation
don't. Quotation
Maybe Quotation
-- Quotation
" Quotation
"I Quotation
forgive Quotation
everybody, Quotation
Sid. Quotation
[Groan.] Quotation
Tell Quotation
'em Quotation
so, Quotation
Sid. Quotation
And Quotation
Sid, Quotation
you Quotation
give Quotation
my Quotation
window-sash Quotation
and Quotation
my Quotation
cat Quotation
with Quotation
one Quotation
eye Quotation
to Quotation
that Quotation
new Quotation
girl Quotation
that's Quotation
come Quotation
to Quotation
town, Quotation
and Quotation
tell Quotation
her Quotation
-- Quotation
" Quotation
But O
Sid Entity
had O
snatched O
his O
clothes O
and O
gone. O
Tom Entity
was O
suffering O
in O
reality, O
now, O
so O
handsomely O
was O
his O
imagination O
working, O
and O
so O
his O
groans O
had O
gathered O
quite O
a O
genuine O
tone. O
Sid Entity
flew O
down-stairs O
and O
said: Cue
"Oh, Quotation
Aunt Quotation
Polly, Quotation
come! Quotation
Tom's Quotation
dying!" Quotation
"Dying!" Quotation
"Yes'm. Quotation
Don't Quotation
wait-- Quotation
come Quotation
quick!" Quotation
"Rubbage! Quotation
I Quotation
don't Quotation
believe Quotation
it!" Quotation
But O
she Entity
fled O
up-stairs, O
nevertheless, O
with O
Sid O
and O
Mary Entity
at O
her O
heels. O
And O
her O
face O
grew O
white, O
too, O
and O
her O
lip O
trembled. O
When O
she O
reached O
the O
bedside O
she Entity
gasped Cue
out: Cue
"You, Quotation
Tom! Quotation
Tom, Quotation
what's Quotation
the Quotation
matter Quotation
with Quotation
you?" Quotation
"Oh, Quotation
auntie, Quotation
I'm Quotation
-- Quotation
" Quotation
"What's Quotation
the Quotation
matter Quotation
with Quotation
you-- Quotation
what Quotation
is Quotation
the Quotation
matter Quotation
with Quotation
you, Quotation
child?" Quotation
"Oh, Quotation
auntie, Quotation
my Quotation
sore Quotation
toe's Quotation
mortified!" Quotation
The O
old O
lady O
sank O
down O
into O
a O
chair O
and O
laughed O
a O
little, O
then O
cried O
a O
little, O
then O
did O
both O
together. O
This O
restored O
her O
and O
she Entity
said: Cue
"Tom, Quotation
what Quotation
a Quotation
turn Quotation
you Quotation
did Quotation
give Quotation
me. Quotation
Now Quotation
you Quotation
shut Quotation
up Quotation
that Quotation
nonsense Quotation
and Quotation
climb Quotation
out Quotation
of Quotation
this." Quotation
The O
groans O
ceased O
and O
the O
pain O
vanished O
from O
the O
toe. O
The O
boy O
felt O
a O
little O
foolish, O
and O
he Entity
said: Cue
"Aunt Quotation
Polly, Quotation
it Quotation
SEEMED Quotation
mortified, Quotation
and Quotation
it Quotation
hurt Quotation
so Quotation
I Quotation
never Quotation
minded Quotation
my Quotation
tooth Quotation
at Quotation
all." Quotation
"Your Quotation
tooth, Quotation
indeed! Quotation
What's Quotation
the Quotation
matter Quotation
with Quotation
your Quotation
tooth?" Quotation
"One Quotation
of Quotation
them's Quotation
loose, Quotation
and Quotation
it Quotation
aches Quotation
perfectly Quotation
awful." Quotation
"There, Quotation
there, Quotation
now, Quotation
don't Quotation
begin Quotation
that Quotation
groaning Quotation
again. Quotation
Open Quotation
your Quotation
mouth. Quotation
Well-- Quotation
your Quotation
tooth Quotation
IS Quotation
loose, Quotation
but Quotation
you're Quotation
not Quotation
going Quotation
to Quotation
die Quotation
about Quotation
that. Quotation
Mary, Quotation
get Quotation
me Quotation
a Quotation
silk Quotation
thread, Quotation
and Quotation
a Quotation
chunk Quotation
of Quotation
fire Quotation
out Quotation
of Quotation
the Quotation
kitchen." Quotation
Tom Entity
said: Cue
"Oh, Quotation
please, Quotation
auntie, Quotation
don't Quotation
pull Quotation
it Quotation
out. Quotation
It Quotation
don't Quotation
hurt Quotation
any Quotation
more. Quotation
I Quotation
wish Quotation
I Quotation
may Quotation
never Quotation
stir Quotation
if Quotation
it Quotation
does. Quotation
Please Quotation
don't, Quotation
auntie. Quotation
I Quotation
don't Quotation
want Quotation
to Quotation
stay Quotation
home Quotation
from Quotation
school." Quotation
"Oh, Quotation
you Quotation
don't, Quotation
don't Quotation
you? Quotation
So Quotation
all Quotation
this Quotation
row Quotation
was Quotation
because Quotation
you Quotation
thought Quotation
you'd Quotation
get Quotation
to Quotation
stay Quotation
home Quotation
from Quotation
school Quotation
and Quotation
go Quotation
a-fishing? Quotation
Tom, Quotation
Tom, Quotation
I Quotation
love Quotation
you Quotation
so, Quotation
and Quotation
you Quotation
seem Quotation
to Quotation
try Quotation
every Quotation
way Quotation
you Quotation
can Quotation
to Quotation
break Quotation
my Quotation
old Quotation
heart Quotation
with Quotation
your Quotation
outrageousness." Quotation
By O
this O
time O
the O
dental O
instruments O
were O
ready. O
The O
old O
lady O
made O
one O
end O
of O
the O
silk O
thread O
fast O
to O
Tom's O
tooth O
with O
a O
loop O
and O
tied O
the O
other O
to O
the O
bedpost. O
Then O
she O
seized O
the O
chunk O
of O
fire O
and O
suddenly O
thrust O
it O
almost O
into O
the O
boy's O
face. O
The O
tooth O
hung O
dangling O
by O
the O
bedpost, O
now. O
But O
all O
trials O
bring O
their O
compensations. O
As O
Tom O
wended O
to O
school O
after O
breakfast, O
he O
was O
the O
envy O
of O
every O
boy O
he O
met O
because O
the O
gap O
in O
his O
upper O
row O
of O
teeth O
enabled O
him O
to O
expectorate O
in O
a O
new O
and O
admirable O
way. O
He O
gathered O
quite Entity
a Entity
following Entity
of Entity
lads Entity
interested Entity
in Entity
the Entity
exhibition; Entity
and O
one O
that O
had O
cut O
his O
finger O
and O
had O
been O
a O
centre O
of O
fascination O
and O
homage O
up O
to O
this O
time, O
now O
found O
himself O
suddenly O
without O
an O
adherent, O
and O
shorn O
of O
his O
glory. O
His O
heart O
was O
heavy, O
and O
he Entity
said Cue
with O
a O
disdain O
which O
he O
did O
not O
feel O
that Quotation
it Quotation
wasn't Quotation
anything Quotation
to Quotation
spit Quotation
like Quotation
Tom Quotation
Sawyer; Quotation
but O
another Entity
boy Entity
said, Cue
"Sour Quotation
grapes!" Quotation
and O
he O
wandered O
away O
a O
dismantled O
hero. O
Shortly O
Tom O
came O
upon O
the O
juvenile O
pariah O
of O
the O
village, O
Huckleberry O
Finn, O
son O
of O
the O
town O
drunkard. O
Huckleberry O
was O
cordially O
hated O
and O
dreaded O
by O
all O
the O
mothers O
of O
the O
town, O
because O
he O
was O
idle O
and O
lawless O
and O
vulgar O
and O
bad-- O
and O
because O
all O
their O
children O
admired O
him O
so, O
and O
delighted O
in O
his O
forbidden O
society, O
and O
wished O
they O
dared O
to O
be O
like O
him. O
Tom O
was O
like O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
respectable O
boys, O
in O
that O
he O
envied O
Huckleberry O
his O
gaudy O
outcast O
condition, O
and O
was O
under O
strict O
orders O
not O
to O
play O
with O
him. O
So O
he O
played O
with O
him O
every O
time O
he O
got O
a O
chance. O
Huckleberry O
was O
always O
dressed O
in O
the O
cast-off O
clothes O
of O
full-grown O
men, O
and O
they O
were O
in O
perennial O
bloom O
and O
fluttering O
with O
rags. O
His O
hat O
was O
a O
vast O
ruin O
with O
a O
wide O
crescent O
lopped O
out O
of O
its O
brim; O
his O
coat, O
when O
he O
wore O
one, O
hung O
nearly O
to O
his O
heels O
and O
had O
the O
rearward O
buttons O
far O
down O
the O
back; O
but O
one O
suspender O
supported O
his O
trousers; O
the O
seat O
of O
the O
trousers O
bagged O
low O
and O
contained O
nothing, O
the O
fringed O
legs O
dragged O
in O
the O
dirt O
when O
not O
rolled O
up. O
Huckleberry O
came O
and O
went, O
at O
his O
own O
free O
will. O
He O
slept O
on O
doorsteps O
in O
fine O
weather O
and O
in O
empty O
hogsheads O
in O
wet; O
he O
did O
not O
have O
to O
go O
to O
school O
or O
to O
church, O
or O
call O
any O
being O
master O
or O
obey O
anybody; O
he O
could O
go O
fishing O
or O
swimming O
when O
and O
where O
he O
chose, O
and O
stay O
as O
long O
as O
it O
suited O
him; O
nobody O
forbade O
him O
to O
fight; O
he O
could O
sit O
up O
as O
late O
as O
he O
pleased; O
he O
was O
always O
the O
first O
boy O
that O
went O
barefoot O
in O
the O
spring O
and O
the O
last O
to O
resume O
leather O
in O
the O
fall; O
he O
never O
had O
to O
wash, O
nor O
put O
on O
clean O
clothes; O
he O
could O
swear O
wonderfully. O
In O
a O
word, O
everything O
that O
goes O
to O
make O
life O
precious O
that O
boy O
had. O
So O
thought O
every O
harassed, O
hampered, O
respectable O
boy O
in O
St. O
Petersburg. O
Tom Entity
hailed Cue
the Entity
romantic Entity
outcast: Entity
"Hello, Quotation
Huckleberry!" Quotation
"Hello Quotation
yourself, Quotation
and Quotation
see Quotation
how Quotation
you Quotation
like Quotation
it." Quotation
"What's Quotation
that Quotation
you Quotation
got?" Quotation
"Dead Quotation
cat." Quotation
"Lemme Quotation
see Quotation
him, Quotation
Huck. Quotation
My, Quotation

pretty Quotation
stiff. Quotation
Where'd Quotation

him?" Quotation
"Bought Quotation

"What Quotation

"I Quotation
give Quotation
a Quotation
blue Quotation
ticket Quotation
and Quotation
a Quotation
bladder Quotation
that Quotation
I Quotation
got Quotation
at Quotation
the Quotation
slaughter-house." Quotation
"Where'd Quotation
you Quotation
get Quotation
the Quotation
blue Quotation
ticket?" Quotation
"Bought Quotation
it Quotation
off'n Quotation
Ben Quotation
Rogers Quotation

weeks Quotation
ago Quotation
for Quotation
a Quotation
hoop-stick." Quotation
"Say-- Quotation

for, Quotation
Huck?" Quotation
"Good Quotation
for? Quotation
Cure Quotation
warts Quotation

"No! Quotation
Is Quotation
that Quotation
so? Quotation
I Quotation
know Quotation
something Quotation
that's Quotation
better." Quotation
"I Quotation
bet Quotation
you Quotation
don't. Quotation
What Quotation
is Quotation
it?" Quotation
"Why, Quotation
spunk-water." Quotation
"Spunk-water! Quotation
I Quotation
wouldn't Quotation
give Quotation
a Quotation
dern Quotation
for Quotation
spunk-water." Quotation
"You Quotation
wouldn't, Quotation
wouldn't Quotation
you? Quotation
D'you Quotation
ever Quotation
try Quotation
it?" Quotation
"No, Quotation
I Quotation
hain't. Quotation
But Quotation
Bob Quotation
Tanner Quotation
did." Quotation
"Who Quotation
told Quotation
you Quotation
so!" Quotation
"Why, Quotation
he Quotation
told Quotation
Jeff Quotation
Thatcher, Quotation
and Quotation
Jeff Quotation
told Quotation
Johnny Quotation
Baker, Quotation
and Quotation
Johnny Quotation
told Quotation
Jim Quotation
Hollis, Quotation

Ben Quotation
Rogers, Quotation
and Quotation
Ben Quotation
told Quotation
a Quotation
nigger, Quotation
and Quotation
the Quotation
nigger Quotation
told Quotation
me. Quotation
There Quotation

"Well, Quotation
what Quotation
of Quotation
it? Quotation
They'll Quotation
all Quotation
lie. Quotation
Leastways Quotation
all Quotation
but Quotation
the Quotation
nigger. Quotation
I Quotation
don't Quotation
know Quotation
HIM. Quotation
But Quotation
I Quotation
never Quotation

Shucks! Quotation
Now Quotation
you Quotation
tell Quotation
me Quotation
how Quotation

it, Quotation
Huck." Quotation
"Why, Quotation
he Quotation
took Quotation
and Quotation
dipped Quotation
his Quotation
hand Quotation
in Quotation
a Quotation
rotten Quotation
stump Quotation
where Quotation
the Quotation
rain-water Quotation
was." Quotation
"In Quotation
the Quotation
daytime?" Quotation
"Certainly." Quotation
"With Quotation
his Quotation
face Quotation
to Quotation
the Quotation
stump?" Quotation
"Yes. Quotation
Least Quotation
I Quotation
reckon Quotation
so." Quotation
"Did Quotation
he Quotation
say Quotation
anything?" Quotation
"I Quotation
don't Quotation
reckon Quotation
he Quotation
did. Quotation
I Quotation
don't Quotation
know." Quotation
"Aha! Quotation
Talk Quotation
about Quotation
trying Quotation
to Quotation
cure Quotation
warts Quotation
with Quotation
spunk-water Quotation
such Quotation
a Quotation
blame Quotation
fool Quotation
way Quotation
as Quotation
that! Quotation
Why, Quotation
that Quotation
ain't Quotation
a-going Quotation
to Quotation
do Quotation
any Quotation
good. Quotation
You Quotation
got Quotation
to Quotation
go Quotation
all Quotation
by Quotation
yourself, Quotation
to Quotation
the Quotation
middle Quotation
of Quotation
the Quotation
woods, Quotation
where Quotation
you Quotation
know Quotation
there's Quotation
a Quotation
spunk-water Quotation
stump, Quotation
and Quotation
just Quotation
as Quotation
it's Quotation
midnight Quotation
you Quotation
back Quotation
up Quotation
against Quotation
the Quotation
stump Quotation
and Quotation
jam Quotation
your Quotation
hand Quotation
in Quotation
and Quotation
say: Quotation
'Barley-corn, Quotation
barley-corn, Quotation
injun-meal Quotation
shorts, Quotation
Spunk-water, Quotation
spunk-water, Quotation
swaller Quotation
these Quotation
warts,' Quotation
and Quotation
then Quotation
walk Quotation
away Quotation
quick, Quotation
eleven Quotation
steps, Quotation
with Quotation
your Quotation
eyes Quotation
shut, Quotation
and Quotation
then Quotation
turn Quotation
around Quotation
three Quotation
times Quotation
and Quotation
walk Quotation
home Quotation
without Quotation
speaking Quotation
to Quotation
anybody. Quotation
 Quotation
Because Quotation
if Quotation
you Quotation
speak Quotation
the Quotation
charm's Quotation
busted." Quotation
"Well, Quotation
that Quotation
sounds Quotation
like Quotation
a Quotation
good Quotation
way; Quotation
but Quotation
that Quotation
ain't Quotation
the Quotation
way Quotation
Bob Quotation
Tanner Quotation
done." Quotation
"No, Quotation
sir, Quotation
you Quotation
can Quotation
bet Quotation
he Quotation
didn't, Quotation
becuz Quotation
he's Quotation
the Quotation
wartiest Quotation
boy Quotation
in Quotation
this Quotation
town; Quotation
and Quotation
he Quotation
wouldn't Quotation
have Quotation
a Quotation
wart Quotation
on Quotation
him Quotation
if Quotation
he'd Quotation
knowed Quotation
how Quotation
to Quotation
work Quotation
spunk-water. Quotation
I've Quotation
took Quotation
off Quotation
thousands Quotation
of Quotation
warts Quotation
off Quotation
of Quotation
my Quotation
hands Quotation
that Quotation
way, Quotation
Huck. Quotation
I Quotation
play Quotation
with Quotation
frogs Quotation
so Quotation
much Quotation
that Quotation
I've Quotation
always Quotation
got Quotation
considerable Quotation
many Quotation
warts. Quotation
Sometimes Quotation
I Quotation
take Quotation
'em Quotation
off Quotation
with Quotation
a Quotation
bean." Quotation
"Yes, Quotation
bean's Quotation
good. Quotation
I've Quotation
done Quotation
that." Quotation
"Have Quotation
you? Quotation
What's Quotation
your Quotation
way?" Quotation
"You Quotation
take Quotation
and Quotation
split Quotation
the Quotation
bean, Quotation
and Quotation
cut Quotation
the Quotation
wart Quotation
so Quotation
as Quotation
to Quotation
get Quotation
some Quotation
blood, Quotation
and Quotation
then Quotation
you Quotation
put Quotation
the Quotation
blood Quotation
on Quotation
one Quotation
piece Quotation
of Quotation
the Quotation
bean Quotation
and Quotation
take Quotation
and Quotation
dig Quotation
a Quotation
hole Quotation
and Quotation
bury Quotation
it Quotation
'bout Quotation
midnight Quotation
at Quotation
the Quotation
crossroads Quotation
in Quotation
the Quotation
dark Quotation
of Quotation
the Quotation
moon, Quotation
and Quotation
then Quotation
you Quotation
burn Quotation
up Quotation
the Quotation
rest Quotation
of Quotation
the Quotation
bean. Quotation
You Quotation
see Quotation
that Quotation
piece Quotation
that's Quotation
got Quotation
the Quotation
blood Quotation
on Quotation
it Quotation
will Quotation
keep Quotation
drawing Quotation
and Quotation
drawing, Quotation
trying Quotation
to Quotation
fetch Quotation
the Quotation
other Quotation
piece Quotation
to Quotation
it, Quotation
and Quotation
so Quotation
that Quotation
helps Quotation
the Quotation
blood Quotation
to Quotation
draw Quotation
the Quotation
wart, Quotation
and Quotation
pretty Quotation
soon Quotation
off Quotation
she Quotation
comes." Quotation
"Yes, Quotation
that's Quotation
it, Quotation
Huck-- Quotation
that's Quotation
it; Quotation
though Quotation
when Quotation
you're Quotation
burying Quotation
it Quotation
if Quotation
you Quotation
say Quotation
'Down Quotation
bean; Quotation
off Quotation
wart; Quotation
come Quotation
no Quotation
more Quotation
to Quotation
bother Quotation
me!' Quotation
it's Quotation
better. Quotation
That's Quotation
the Quotation
way Quotation
Joe Quotation
Harper Quotation
does, Quotation
and Quotation
he's Quotation
been Quotation
nearly Quotation
to Quotation
Coonville Quotation
and Quotation
most Quotation
everywheres. Quotation
But Quotation
say-- Quotation
how Quotation
do Quotation
you Quotation
cure Quotation
'em Quotation
with Quotation
dead Quotation
cats?" Quotation
"Why, Quotation
you Quotation
take Quotation
your Quotation
cat Quotation
and Quotation
go Quotation
and Quotation
get Quotation
in Quotation
the Quotation
graveyard Quotation
'long Quotation
about Quotation
midnight Quotation
when Quotation
somebody Quotation
that Quotation
was Quotation
wicked Quotation
has Quotation
been Quotation
buried; Quotation
and Quotation
when Quotation
it's Quotation
midnight Quotation
a Quotation
devil Quotation
will Quotation
come, Quotation
or Quotation
maybe Quotation
two Quotation
or Quotation
three, Quotation
but Quotation
you Quotation
can't Quotation
see Quotation
'em, Quotation
you Quotation
can Quotation
only Quotation
hear Quotation
something Quotation
like Quotation
the Quotation
wind, Quotation
or Quotation
maybe Quotation
hear Quotation
'em Quotation
talk; Quotation
and Quotation
when Quotation
they're Quotation
taking Quotation
that Quotation
feller Quotation
away, Quotation
you Quotation
heave Quotation
your Quotation
cat Quotation
after Quotation
'em Quotation
and Quotation
say, Quotation
'Devil Quotation
follow Quotation
corpse, Quotation
cat Quotation
follow Quotation
devil, Quotation
warts Quotation
follow Quotation
cat, Quotation
I'm Quotation
done Quotation
with Quotation
ye!' Quotation
That'll Quotation
fetch Quotation
ANY Quotation
wart." Quotation
"Sounds Quotation
right. Quotation
D'you Quotation
ever Quotation
try Quotation
it, Quotation
Huck?" Quotation
"No, Quotation
but Quotation
old Quotation
Mother Quotation
Hopkins Quotation
told Quotation
me." Quotation
"Well, Quotation
I Quotation
reckon Quotation
it's Quotation
so, Quotation
then. Quotation
Becuz Quotation
they Quotation
say Quotation
she's Quotation
a Quotation
witch." Quotation
"Say! Quotation
Why, Quotation
Tom, Quotation
I Quotation
KNOW Quotation
she Quotation
is. Quotation
She Quotation
witched Quotation
pap. Quotation
Pap Quotation
says Quotation
so Quotation
his Quotation
own Quotation
self. Quotation
He Quotation
come Quotation
along Quotation
one Quotation
day, Quotation
and Quotation
he Quotation
see Quotation
she Quotation
was Quotation
a-witching Quotation
him, Quotation
so Quotation
he Quotation
took Quotation
up Quotation
a Quotation
rock, Quotation
and Quotation
if Quotation
she Quotation
hadn't Quotation
dodged, Quotation
he'd Quotation
a Quotation
got Quotation
her. Quotation
Well, Quotation
that Quotation
very Quotation
night Quotation
he Quotation
rolled Quotation
off'n Quotation
a Quotation
shed Quotation
wher' Quotation
he Quotation
was Quotation
a Quotation
layin Quotation
drunk, Quotation
and Quotation
broke Quotation
his Quotation
arm." Quotation
"Why, Quotation
that's Quotation
awful. Quotation
How Quotation
did Quotation
he Quotation
know Quotation
she Quotation
was Quotation
a-witching Quotation
him?" Quotation
"Lord, Quotation
pap Quotation
can Quotation
tell, Quotation
easy. Quotation
Pap Quotation
says Quotation
when Quotation
they Quotation
keep Quotation
looking Quotation
at Quotation
you Quotation
right Quotation
stiddy, Quotation
they're Quotation
a-witching Quotation
you. Quotation
Specially Quotation
if Quotation
they Quotation
mumble. Quotation
Becuz Quotation
when Quotation
they Quotation
mumble Quotation
they're Quotation
saying Quotation
the Quotation
Lord's Quotation
Prayer Quotation
backards." Quotation
"Say, Quotation
Hucky, Quotation
when Quotation
you Quotation
going Quotation
to Quotation
try Quotation
the Quotation
cat?" Quotation
"To-night. Quotation
I Quotation
reckon Quotation
they'll Quotation
come Quotation
after Quotation
old Quotation
Hoss Quotation
Williams Quotation
to-night." Quotation
"But Quotation
they Quotation
buried Quotation
him Quotation
Saturday. Quotation
Didn't Quotation
they Quotation
get Quotation
him Quotation
Saturday Quotation
night?" Quotation
"Why, Quotation
how Quotation
you Quotation
talk! Quotation
How Quotation
could Quotation
their Quotation
charms Quotation
work Quotation
till Quotation
midnight?-- Quotation
and Quotation
THEN Quotation
it's Quotation
Sunday. Quotation
Devils Quotation
don't Quotation
slosh Quotation
around Quotation
much Quotation
of Quotation
a Quotation
Sunday, Quotation
I Quotation
don't Quotation
reckon." Quotation
"I Quotation
never Quotation
thought Quotation
of Quotation
that. Quotation
That's Quotation
so. Quotation
Lemme Quotation
go Quotation
with Quotation
you?" Quotation
"Of Quotation
course-- Quotation
if Quotation
you Quotation
ain't Quotation
afeard." Quotation
"Afeard! Quotation
'Tain't Quotation
likely. Quotation
Will Quotation
you Quotation
meow?" Quotation
"Yes-- Quotation
and Quotation
you Quotation
meow Quotation
back, Quotation
if Quotation
you Quotation
get Quotation
a Quotation
chance. Quotation
Last Quotation
time, Quotation
you Quotation
kep' Quotation
me Quotation
a-meowing Quotation
around Quotation
till Quotation
old Quotation
Hays Quotation
went Quotation
to Quotation
throwing Quotation
rocks Quotation
at Quotation
me Quotation
and Quotation
says Quotation
'Dern Quotation
that Quotation
cat!' Quotation
and Quotation
so Quotation
I Quotation
hove Quotation
a Quotation
brick Quotation
through Quotation
his Quotation
window-- Quotation
but Quotation
don't Quotation
you Quotation
tell." Quotation
"I Quotation
won't. Quotation
I Quotation
couldn't Quotation
meow Quotation
that Quotation
night, Quotation
becuz Quotation
auntie Quotation
was Quotation
watching Quotation
me, Quotation
but Quotation
I'll Quotation
meow Quotation
this Quotation
time. Quotation
Say-- Quotation
what's Quotation
that?" Quotation
"Nothing Quotation
but Quotation
a Quotation
tick." Quotation
"Where'd Quotation
you Quotation
get Quotation
him?" Quotation
"Out Quotation
in Quotation
the Quotation
woods." Quotation
"What'll Quotation
you Quotation
take Quotation
for Quotation
him?" Quotation
"I Quotation
don't Quotation
know. Quotation
I Quotation
don't Quotation
want Quotation
to Quotation
sell Quotation
him." Quotation
"All Quotation
right. Quotation
It's Quotation
a Quotation
mighty Quotation
small Quotation
tick, Quotation
anyway." Quotation
"Oh, Quotation
anybody Quotation
can Quotation
run Quotation
a Quotation
tick Quotation
down Quotation
that Quotation
don't Quotation
belong Quotation
to Quotation
them. Quotation
I'm Quotation
satisfied Quotation
with Quotation
it. Quotation
It's Quotation
a Quotation
good Quotation
enough Quotation
tick Quotation
for Quotation
me." Quotation
"Sho, Quotation
there's Quotation
ticks Quotation
a Quotation
plenty. Quotation
I Quotation
could Quotation
have Quotation
a Quotation
thousand Quotation
of Quotation
'em Quotation
if Quotation
I Quotation
wanted Quotation
to." Quotation
"Well, Quotation
why Quotation
don't Quotation
you? Quotation
Becuz Quotation
you Quotation
know Quotation
mighty Quotation
well Quotation
you Quotation
can't. Quotation
This Quotation
is Quotation
a Quotation
pretty Quotation
early Quotation
tick, Quotation
I Quotation
reckon. Quotation
It's Quotation
the Quotation
first Quotation
one Quotation
I've Quotation
seen Quotation
this Quotation
year." Quotation
"Say, Quotation
Huck-- Quotation
I'll Quotation
give Quotation
you Quotation
my Quotation
tooth Quotation
for Quotation
him." Quotation
"Less Quotation
see Quotation
it." Quotation
Tom Entity
got O
out O
a O
bit O
of O
paper O
and O
carefully O
unrolled O
it. O
Huckleberry Entity
viewed O
it O
wistfully. O
The O
temptation O
was O
very O
strong. O
At O
last O
he Entity
said: Cue
"Is Quotation
it Quotation
genuwyne?" Quotation
Tom Entity
lifted O
his O
lip O
and O
showed O
the O
vacancy. O
"Well, Quotation
all Quotation
right," Quotation
said Cue
Huckleberry, Entity
"it's Quotation
a Quotation
trade." Quotation
Tom O
enclosed O
the O
tick O
in O
the O
percussion-cap O
box O
that O
had O
lately O
been O
the O
pinchbug's O
prison, O
and O
the O
boys O
separated, O
each O
feeling O
wealthier O
than O
before. O
When O
Tom O
reached O
the O
little O
isolated O
frame O
schoolhouse, O
he O
strode O
in O
briskly, O
with O
the O
manner O
of O
one O
who O
had O
come O
with O
all O
honest O
speed. O
He O
hung O
his O
hat O
on O
a O
peg O
and O
flung O
himself O
into O
his O
seat O
with O
business-like O
alacrity. O
The Entity
master, Entity
throned O
on O
high O
in O
his O
great O
splint-bottom O
arm-chair, O
was O
dozing, O
lulled O
by O
the O
drowsy O
hum O
of O
study. O
The O
interruption O
roused O
him. O
"Thomas Quotation
Sawyer!" Quotation
Tom Entity
knew O
that O
when O
his O
name O
was O
pronounced O
in O
full, O
it O
meant O
trouble. O
"Sir!" Quotation
"Come Quotation
up Quotation
here. Quotation
Now, Quotation
sir, Quotation
why Quotation
are Quotation
you Quotation
late Quotation
again, Quotation
as Quotation
usual?" Quotation
Tom O
was O
about O
to O
take O
refuge O
in O
a O
lie, O
when O
he O
saw O
two O
long O
tails O
of O
yellow O
hair O
hanging O
down O
a O
back O
that O
he O
recognized O
by O
the O
electric O
sympathy O
of O
love; O
and O
by O
that O
form O
was O
THE O
ONLY O
VACANT O
PLACE O
on O
the O
girls' O
side O
of O
the O
schoolhouse. O
He Entity
instantly O
said: Cue
"I Quotation
STOPPED Quotation
TO Quotation
TALK Quotation
WITH Quotation
HUCKLEBERRY Quotation
FINN!" Quotation
The Entity
master's Entity
pulse O
stood O
still, O
and O
he O
stared O
helplessly. O
The O
buzz O
of O
study O
ceased. O
The O
pupils O
wondered O
if O
this Entity
foolhardy Entity
boy Entity
had O
lost O
his O
mind. O
The Entity
master Entity
said: Cue
"You-- Quotation
you Quotation
did Quotation
what?" Quotation
"Stopped Quotation
to Quotation
talk Quotation
with Quotation
Huckleberry Quotation
Finn." Quotation
There O
was O
no O
mistaking O
the O
words. O
"Thomas Quotation
Sawyer, Quotation
this Quotation
is Quotation
the Quotation
most Quotation
astounding Quotation
confession Quotation
I Quotation
have Quotation
ever Quotation
listened Quotation
to. Quotation
No Quotation
mere Quotation
ferule Quotation
will Quotation
answer Quotation
for Quotation
this Quotation
offence. Quotation
Take Quotation
off Quotation
your Quotation
jacket." Quotation
The Entity
master's Entity
arm O
performed O
until O
it O
was O
tired O
and O
the O
stock O
of O
switches O
notably O
diminished. O
Then O
the O
order O
followed: O
"Now, Quotation
sir, Quotation
go Quotation
and Quotation
sit Quotation
with Quotation
the Quotation
girls! Quotation
And Quotation
let Quotation
this Quotation
be Quotation
a Quotation
warning Quotation
to Quotation
you." Quotation
The O
titter O
that O
rippled O
around O
the O
room O
appeared O
to O
abash O
the Entity
boy, Entity
but O
in O
reality O
that O
result O
was O
caused O
rather O
more O
by O
his O
worshipful O
awe O
of O
his O
unknown O
idol O
and O
the O
dread O
pleasure O
that O
lay O
in O
his O
high O
good O
fortune. O
He O
sat O
down O
upon O
the O
end O
of O
the O
pine O
bench O
and O
the O
girl O
hitched O
herself O
away O
from O
him O
with O
a O
toss O
of O
her O
head. O
Nudges O
and O
winks O
and O
whispers O
traversed O
the O
room, O
but O
Tom O
sat O
still, O
with O
his O
arms O
upon O
the O
long, O
low O
desk O
before O
him, O
and O
seemed O
to O
study O
his O
book. O
By O
and O
by O
attention O
ceased O
from O
him, O
and O
the O
accustomed O
school O
murmur O
rose O
upon O
the O
dull O
air O
once O
more. O
Presently O
the O
boy O
began O
to O
steal O
furtive O
glances O
at O
the O
girl. O
She O
observed O
it, O
"made O
a O
mouth" O
at O
him O
and O
gave O
him O
the O
back O
of O
her O
head O
for O
the O
space O
of O
a O
minute. O
When O
she O
cautiously O
faced O
around O
again, O
a O
peach O
lay O
before O
her. O
She O
thrust O
it O
away. O
Tom O
gently O
put O
it O
back. O
She O
thrust O
it O
away O
again, O
but O
with O
less O
animosity. O
Tom O
patiently O
returned O
it O
to O
its O
place. O
Then O
she O
let O
it O
remain. O
Tom O
scrawled O
on O
his O
slate, O
"Please O
take O
it O
-- O
I O
got O
more." O
The O
girl O
glanced O
at O
the O
words, O
but O
made O
no O
sign. O
Now O
the O
boy O
began O
to O
draw O
something O
on O
the O
slate, O
hiding O
his O
work O
with O
his O
left O
hand. O
For O
a O
time O
the O
girl O
refused O
to O
notice; O
but O
her O
human O
curiosity O
presently O
began O
to O
manifest O
itself O
by O
hardly O
perceptible O
signs. O
The O
boy O
worked O
on, O
apparently O
unconscious. O
The O
girl O
made O
a O
sort O
of O
noncommittal O
attempt O
to O
see, O
but O
the O
boy O
did O
not O
betray O
that O
he O
was O
aware O
of O
it. O
At O
last O
she Entity
gave O
in O
and O
hesitatingly O
whispered: Cue
"Let Quotation
me Quotation
see Quotation
it." Quotation
Tom Entity
partly O
uncovered O
a O
dismal O
caricature O
of O
a O
house O
with O
two O
gable O
ends O
to O
it O
and O
a O
corkscrew O
of O
smoke O
issuing O
from O
the O
chimney. O
Then O
the O
girl's O
interest O
began O
to O
fasten O
itself O
upon O
the O
work O
and O
she O
forgot O
everything O
else. O
When O
it O
was O
finished, O
she Entity
gazed O
a O
moment, O
then O
whispered: Cue
"It's Quotation
nice-- Quotation
make Quotation
a Quotation
man." Quotation
The Entity
artist Entity
erected O
a O
man O
in O
the O
front O
yard, O
that O
resembled O
a O
derrick. O
He O
could O
have O
stepped O
over O
the O
house; O
but O
the O
girl O
was O
not O
hypercritical; O
she Entity
was O
satisfied O
with O
the O
monster, O
and O
whispered: Cue
"It's Quotation
a Quotation
beautiful Quotation
man-- Quotation
now Quotation
make Quotation
me Quotation
coming Quotation
along." Quotation
Tom Entity
drew O
an O
hour-glass O
with O
a O
full O
moon O
and O
straw O
limbs O
to O
it O
and O
armed O
the O
spreading O
fingers O
with O
a O
portentous O
fan. O
The Entity
girl Entity
said: Cue
"It's Quotation
ever Quotation
so Quotation
nice Quotation
-- Quotation
I Quotation
wish Quotation
I Quotation
could Quotation
draw." Quotation
"It's Quotation
easy," Quotation
whispered Cue
Tom, Entity
"I'll Quotation
learn Quotation
you." Quotation
"Oh, Quotation
will Quotation
you? Quotation
When?" Quotation
"At Quotation
noon. Quotation
Do Quotation
you Quotation
go Quotation
home Quotation
to Quotation
dinner?" Quotation
"I'll Quotation
stay Quotation
if Quotation
you Quotation
will." Quotation
"Good-- Quotation
that's Quotation
a Quotation
whack. Quotation
What's Quotation
your Quotation
name?" Quotation
"Becky Quotation
Thatcher. Quotation
What's Quotation
yours? Quotation
Oh, Quotation
I Quotation
know. Quotation
It's Quotation
Thomas Quotation
Sawyer." Quotation
"That's Quotation
the Quotation
name Quotation
they Quotation
lick Quotation
me Quotation
by. Quotation
I'm Quotation
Tom Quotation
when Quotation
I'm Quotation
good. Quotation
You Quotation
call Quotation
me Quotation
Tom, Quotation
will Quotation
you?" Quotation
"Yes." Quotation
Now O
Tom Entity
began O
to O
scrawl O
something O
on O
the O
slate, O
hiding O
the O
words O
from O
the O
girl. O
But O
she O
was O
not O
backward O
this O
time. O
She Entity
begged Cue
to Quotation
see. Quotation
Tom Entity
said: Cue
"Oh, Quotation
it Quotation
ain't Quotation
anything." Quotation
"Yes Quotation
it Quotation
is." Quotation
"No Quotation
it Quotation
ain't. Quotation
You Quotation
don't Quotation
want Quotation
to Quotation
see." Quotation
"Yes Quotation
I Quotation
do, Quotation
indeed Quotation
I Quotation
do. Quotation
Please Quotation
let Quotation
me." Quotation
"You'll Quotation
tell." Quotation
"No Quotation
I Quotation
won't-- Quotation
deed Quotation
and Quotation
deed Quotation
and Quotation
double Quotation
deed Quotation
won't." Quotation
"You Quotation
won't Quotation
tell Quotation
anybody Quotation
at Quotation
all? Quotation
Ever, Quotation
as Quotation
long Quotation
as Quotation
you Quotation
live?" Quotation
"No, Quotation
I Quotation
won't Quotation
ever Quotation
tell Quotation
ANYbody. Quotation
Now Quotation
let Quotation
me." Quotation
"Oh, Quotation
YOU Quotation
don't Quotation
want Quotation
to Quotation
see!" Quotation
"Now Quotation
that Quotation
you Quotation
treat Quotation
me Quotation
so, Quotation
I Quotation
WILL Quotation
see." Quotation
And O
she Entity
put O
her O
small O
hand O
upon O
his O
and O
a O
little O
scuffle O
ensued, O
Tom Entity
pretending O
to O
resist O
in O
earnest O
but O
letting O
his O
hand O
slip O
by O
degrees O
till O
these O
words O
were O
revealed: O
"I O
LOVE O
YOU." O
"Oh, Quotation
you Quotation
bad Quotation
thing!" Quotation
And O
she Entity
hit O
his Entity
hand O
a O
smart O
rap, O
but O
reddened O
and O
looked O
pleased, O
nevertheless. O
Just O
at O
this O
juncture O
the O
boy O
felt O
a O
slow, O
fateful O
grip O
closing O
on O
his O
ear, O
and O
a O
steady O
lifting O
impulse. O
In O
that O
wise O
he O
was O
borne O
across O
the O
house O
and O
deposited O
in O
his O
own O
seat, O
under O
a O
peppering O
fire O
of O
giggles O
from O
the O
whole O
school. O
Then O
the O
master O
stood O
over O
him O
during O
a O
few O
awful O
moments, O
and O
finally O
moved O
away O
to O
his O
throne O
without O
saying O
a O
word. O
But O
although O
Tom's O
ear O
tingled, O
his O
heart O
was O
jubilant. O
As O
the O
school O
quieted O
down O
Tom O
made O
an O
honest O
effort O
to O
study, O
but O
the O
turmoil O
within O
him O
was O
too O
great. O
In O
turn O
he O
took O
his O
place O
in O
the O
reading O
class O
and O
made O
a O
botch O
of O
it; O
then O
in O
the O
geography O
class O
and O
turned O
lakes O
into O
mountains, O
mountains O
into O
rivers, O
and O
rivers O
into O
continents, O
till O
chaos O
was O
come O
again; O
then O
in O
the O
spelling O
class, O
and O
got O
"turned O
down," O
by O
a O
succession O
of O
mere O
baby O
words, O
till O
he O
brought O
up O
at O
the O
foot O
and O
yielded O
up O
the O
pewter O
medal O
which O
he O
had O
worn O
with O
ostentation O
for O
months. O
 O
 O

 O
CHAPTER O
VII O
THE O
harder O
Tom O
tried O
to O
fasten O
his O
mind O
on O
his O
book, O
the O
more O
his O
ideas O
wandered. O
So O
at O
last, O
with O
a O
sigh O
and O
a O
yawn, O
he O
gave O
it O
up. O
It O
seemed O
to O
him O
that O
the O
noon O
recess O
would O
never O
come. O
The O
air O
was O
utterly O
dead. O
There O
was O
not O
a O
breath O
stirring. O
It O
was O
the O
sleepiest O
of O
sleepy O
days. O
The O
drowsing O
murmur O
of O
the O
five O
and O
twenty O
studying O
scholars O
soothed O
the O
soul O
like O
the O
spell O
that O
is O
in O
the O
murmur O
of O
bees. O
Away O
off O
in O
the O
flaming O
sunshine, O
Cardiff O
Hill O
lifted O
its O
soft O
green O
sides O
through O
a O
shimmering O
veil O
of O
heat, O
tinted O
with O
the O
purple O
of O
distance; O
a O
few O
birds O
floated O
on O
lazy O
wing O
high O
in O
the O
air; O
no O
other O
living O
thing O
was O
visible O
but O
some O
cows, O
and O
they O
were O
asleep. O
Tom's O
heart O
ached O
to O
be O
free, O
or O
else O
to O
have O
something O
of O
interest O
to O
do O
to O
pass O
the O
dreary O
time. O
His O
hand O
wandered O
into O
his O
pocket O
and O
his O
face O
lit O
up O
with O
a O
glow O
of O
gratitude O
that O
was O
prayer, O
though O
he O
did O
not O
know O
it. O
Then O
furtively O
the O
percussion-cap O
box O
came O
out. O
He O
released O
the O
tick O
and O
put O
him O
on O
the O
long O
flat O
desk. O
The O
creature O
probably O
glowed O
with O
a O
gratitude O
that O
amounted O
to O
prayer, O
too, O
at O
this O
moment, O
but O
it O
was O
premature: O
for O
when O
he O
started O
thankfully O
to O
travel O
off, O
Tom O
turned O
him O
aside O
with O
a O
pin O
and O
made O
him O
take O
a O
new O
direction. O
Tom's O
bosom O
friend O
sat O
next O
him, O
suffering O
just O
as O
Tom O
had O
been, O
and O
now O
he O
was O
deeply O
and O
gratefully O
interested O
in O
this O
entertainment O
in O
an O
instant. O
This O
bosom O
friend O
was O
Joe O
Harper. O
The O
two O
boys O
were O
sworn O
friends O
all O
the O
week, O
and O
embattled O
enemies O
on O
Saturdays. O
Joe O
took O
a O
pin O
out O
of O
his O
lapel O
and O
began O
to O
assist O
in O
exercising O
the O
prisoner. O
The O
sport O
grew O
in O
interest O
momently. O
Soon O
Tom O
said O
that O
they O
were O
interfering O
with O
each O
other, O
and O
neither O
getting O
the O
fullest O
benefit O
of O
the O
tick. O
So O
he O
put O
Joe's Entity
slate O
on O
the O
desk O
and O
drew O
a O
line O
down O
the O
middle O
of O
it O
from O
top O
to O
bottom. O
"Now," Quotation
said Cue
he, Entity
"as Quotation
long Quotation
as Quotation
he Quotation
is Quotation
on Quotation
your Quotation
side Quotation
you Quotation
can Quotation
stir Quotation
him Quotation
up Quotation
and Quotation
I'll Quotation
let Quotation
him Quotation
alone; Quotation
but Quotation
if Quotation
you Quotation
let Quotation
him Quotation
get Quotation
away Quotation
and Quotation
get Quotation
on Quotation
my Quotation
side, Quotation
you're Quotation
to Quotation
leave Quotation
him Quotation
alone Quotation
as Quotation
long Quotation
as Quotation
I Quotation
can Quotation
keep Quotation
him Quotation
from Quotation
crossing Quotation
over." Quotation
"All Quotation
right, Quotation
go Quotation
ahead; Quotation
start Quotation
him Quotation
up." Quotation
The O
tick O
escaped O
from O
Tom, O
presently, O
and O
crossed O
the O
equator. O
Joe O
harassed O
him O
awhile, O
and O
then O
he O
got O
away O
and O
crossed O
back O
again. O
This O
change O
of O
base O
occurred O
often. O
While O
one O
boy O
was O
worrying O
the O
tick O
with O
absorbing O
interest, O
the O
other O
would O
look O
on O
with O
interest O
as O
strong, O
the O
two O
heads O
bowed O
together O
over O
the O
slate, O
and O
the O
two O
souls O
dead O
to O
all O
things O
else. O
At O
last O
luck O
seemed O
to O
settle O
and O
abide O
with O
Joe. O
The O
tick O
tried O
this, O
that, O
and O
the O
other O
course, O
and O
got O
as O
excited O
and O
as O
anxious O
as O
the O
boys O
themselves, O
but O
time O
and O
again O
just O
as O
he O
would O
have O
victory O
in O
his O
very O
grasp, O
so O
to O
speak, O
and O
Tom's O
fingers O
would O
be O
twitching O
to O
begin, O
Joe's O
pin O
would O
deftly O
head O
him O
off, O
and O
keep O
possession. O
At O
last O
Tom O
could O
stand O
it O
no O
longer. O
The O
temptation O
was O
too O
strong. O
So O
he Entity
reached O
out O
and O
lent O
a O
hand O
with O
his O
pin. O
Joe O
was O
angry O
in O
a O
moment. O
Said Cue
he: Entity
"Tom, Quotation
you Quotation
let Quotation
him Quotation
alone." Quotation
"I Quotation
only Quotation
just Quotation
want Quotation
to Quotation
stir Quotation
him Quotation
up Quotation
a Quotation
little, Quotation
Joe." Quotation
"No, Quotation
sir, Quotation
it Quotation
ain't Quotation
fair; Quotation
you Quotation
just Quotation
let Quotation
him Quotation
alone." Quotation
"Blame Quotation
it, Quotation
I Quotation
ain't Quotation
going Quotation
to Quotation
stir Quotation
him Quotation
much." Quotation
"Let Quotation
him Quotation
alone, Quotation
I Quotation
tell Quotation
you." Quotation
"I Quotation
won't!" Quotation
"You Quotation
shall-- Quotation
he's Quotation
on Quotation
my Quotation
side Quotation
of Quotation
the Quotation
line." Quotation
"Look Quotation
here, Quotation
Joe Quotation
Harper, Quotation
whose Quotation
is Quotation
that Quotation
tick?" Quotation
"I Quotation
don't Quotation
care Quotation
whose Quotation
tick Quotation
he Quotation
is-- Quotation
he's Quotation
on Quotation
my Quotation
side Quotation
of Quotation
the Quotation
line, Quotation
and Quotation
you Quotation
sha'n't Quotation
touch Quotation
him." Quotation
"Well, Quotation
I'll Quotation
just Quotation
bet Quotation
I Quotation
will, Quotation
though. Quotation
He's Quotation
my Quotation
tick Quotation
and Quotation
I'll Quotation
do Quotation
what Quotation
I Quotation
blame Quotation
please Quotation
with Quotation
him, Quotation
or Quotation
die!" Quotation
A O
tremendous O
whack O
came O
down O
on O
Tom's O
shoulders, O
and O
its O
duplicate O
on O
Joe's; O
and O
for O
the O
space O
of O
two O
minutes O
the O
dust O
continued O
to O
fly O
from O
the O
two O
jackets O
and O
the O
whole O
school O
to O
enjoy O
it. O
The O
boys O
had O
been O
too O
absorbed O
to O
notice O
the O
hush O
that O
had O
stolen O
upon O
the O
school O
awhile O
before O
when O
the O
master O
came O
tiptoeing O
down O
the O
room O
and O
stood O
over O
them. O
He O
had O
contemplated O
a O
good O
part O
of O
the O
performance O
before O
he O
contributed O
his O
bit O
of O
variety O
to O
it. O
When O
school O
broke O
up O
at O
noon, O
Tom Entity
flew O
to O
Becky Entity
Thatcher, Entity
and O
whispered Cue
in O
her O
ear: O
"Put Quotation
on Quotation
your Quotation
bonnet Quotation
and Quotation
let Quotation
on Quotation
you're Quotation
going Quotation
home; Quotation
and Quotation
when Quotation
you Quotation
get Quotation
to Quotation
the Quotation
corner, Quotation
give Quotation
the Quotation
rest Quotation
of Quotation
'em Quotation
the Quotation
slip, Quotation
and Quotation
turn Quotation
down Quotation
through Quotation
the Quotation
lane Quotation
and Quotation
come Quotation
back. Quotation
I'll Quotation
go Quotation
the Quotation
other Quotation
way Quotation
and Quotation
come Quotation
it Quotation
over Quotation
'em Quotation
the Quotation
same Quotation
way." Quotation
So O
the O
one O
went O
off O
with O
one O
group O
of O
scholars, O
and O
the O
other O
with O
another. O
In O
a O
little O
while O
the O
two O
met O
at O
the O
bottom O
of O
the O
lane, O
and O
when O
they O
reached O
the O
school O
they O
had O
it O
all O
to O
themselves. O
Then O
they O
sat O
together, O
with O
a O
slate O
before O
them, O
and O
Tom O
gave O
Becky Entity
the O
pencil O
and O
held O
her O
hand O
in O
his, O
guiding O
it, O
and O
so O
created O
another O
surprising O
house. O
When O
the O
interest O
in O
art O
began O
to O
wane, O
the O
two O
fell O
to O
talking. O
Tom O
was O
swimming O
in O
bliss. O
He Entity
said: Cue
"Do Quotation
you Quotation
love Quotation
rats?" Quotation
"No! Quotation
I Quotation
hate Quotation
them!" Quotation
"Well, Quotation
I Quotation
do, Quotation
too-- Quotation
LIVE Quotation
ones. Quotation
But Quotation
I Quotation
mean Quotation
dead Quotation
ones, Quotation
to Quotation
swing Quotation
round Quotation
your Quotation
head Quotation
with Quotation
a Quotation
string." Quotation
"No, Quotation
I Quotation
don't Quotation
care Quotation
for Quotation
rats Quotation
much, Quotation
anyway. Quotation
What Quotation
I Quotation
like Quotation
is Quotation
chewing-gum." Quotation
"Oh, Quotation
I Quotation
should Quotation
say Quotation
so! Quotation
I Quotation
wish Quotation
I Quotation
had Quotation
some Quotation
now." Quotation
"Do Quotation
you? Quotation
I've Quotation
got Quotation
some. Quotation
I'll Quotation
let Quotation
you Quotation
chew Quotation
it Quotation
awhile, Quotation
but Quotation
you Quotation
must Quotation
give Quotation
it Quotation
back Quotation
to Quotation
me." Quotation
That O
was O
agreeable, O
so O
they O
chewed O
it O
turn O
about, O
and O
dangled O
their O
legs O
against O
the O
bench O
in O
excess O
of O
contentment. O
"Was Quotation
you Quotation
ever Quotation
at Quotation
a Quotation
circus?" Quotation
said Cue
Tom. Entity
"Yes, Quotation
and Quotation
my Quotation
pa's Quotation
going Quotation
to Quotation
take Quotation
me Quotation
again Quotation
some Quotation
time, Quotation
if Quotation
I'm Quotation
good." Quotation
"I Quotation
been Quotation
to Quotation
the Quotation
circus Quotation
three Quotation
or Quotation
four Quotation
times-- Quotation
lots Quotation
of Quotation
times. Quotation
Church Quotation
ain't Quotation
shucks Quotation
to Quotation
a Quotation
circus. Quotation
There's Quotation
things Quotation
going Quotation
on Quotation
at Quotation
a Quotation
circus Quotation
all Quotation
the Quotation
time. Quotation
I'm Quotation
going Quotation
to Quotation
be Quotation
a Quotation
clown Quotation
in Quotation
a Quotation
circus Quotation
when Quotation
I Quotation
grow Quotation
up." Quotation
"Oh, Quotation
are Quotation
you! Quotation
That Quotation
will Quotation
be Quotation
nice. Quotation
They're Quotation
so Quotation
lovely, Quotation
all Quotation
spotted Quotation
up." Quotation
"Yes, Quotation
that's Quotation
so. Quotation
And Quotation
they Quotation
get Quotation
slathers Quotation
of Quotation
money-- Quotation
most Quotation
a Quotation
dollar Quotation
a Quotation
day, Quotation
Ben Quotation
Rogers Quotation
says. Quotation
Say, Quotation
Becky, Quotation
was Quotation
you Quotation
ever Quotation
engaged?" Quotation
"What's Quotation
that?" Quotation
"Why, Quotation
engaged Quotation
to Quotation
be Quotation
married." Quotation
"No." Quotation
"Would Quotation
you Quotation
like Quotation
to?" Quotation
"I Quotation
reckon Quotation
so. Quotation
I Quotation
don't Quotation
know. Quotation
What Quotation
is Quotation
it Quotation
like?" Quotation
"Like? Quotation
Why Quotation
it Quotation
ain't Quotation
like Quotation
anything. Quotation
You Quotation
only Quotation
just Quotation
tell Quotation
a Quotation
boy Quotation
you Quotation
won't Quotation
ever Quotation
have Quotation
anybody Quotation
but Quotation
him, Quotation
ever Quotation
ever Quotation
ever, Quotation
and Quotation
then Quotation
you Quotation
kiss Quotation
and Quotation
that's Quotation
all. Quotation
Anybody Quotation
can Quotation
do Quotation
it." Quotation
"Kiss? Quotation
What Quotation
do Quotation
you Quotation
kiss Quotation
for?" Quotation
"Why, Quotation
that, Quotation
you Quotation
know, Quotation
is Quotation
to-- Quotation
well, Quotation
they Quotation
always Quotation
do Quotation
that." Quotation
"Everybody?" Quotation
"Why, Quotation
yes, Quotation
everybody Quotation
that's Quotation
in Quotation
love Quotation
with Quotation
each Quotation
other. Quotation
Do Quotation
you Quotation
remember Quotation
what Quotation
I Quotation
wrote Quotation
on Quotation
the Quotation
slate?" Quotation
"Ye-- Quotation
yes." Quotation
"What Quotation
was Quotation
it?" Quotation
"I Quotation
sha'n't Quotation
tell Quotation
you." Quotation
"Shall Quotation
I Quotation
tell Quotation
YOU?" Quotation
"Ye-- Quotation
yes-- Quotation
but Quotation
some Quotation
other Quotation
time." Quotation
"No, Quotation
now." Quotation
"No, Quotation
not Quotation
now-- Quotation
to-morrow." Quotation
"Oh, Quotation
no, Quotation
NOW. Quotation
Please, Quotation
Becky-- Quotation
I'll Quotation
whisper Quotation
it, Quotation
I'll Quotation
whisper Quotation
it Quotation
ever Quotation
so Quotation
easy." Quotation
Becky O
hesitating, O
Tom O
took O
silence O
for O
consent, O
and O
passed O
his O
arm O
about O
her O
waist O
and O
whispered O
the O
tale O
ever O
so O
softly, O
with O
his O
mouth O
close O
to O
her O
ear. O
And O
then O
he Entity
added: Cue
"Now Quotation
you Quotation
whisper Quotation
it Quotation
to Quotation
me-- Quotation
just Quotation
the Quotation
same." Quotation
She Entity
resisted, O
for O
a O
while, O
and O
then O
said: Cue
"You Quotation
turn Quotation
your Quotation
face Quotation
away Quotation
so Quotation
you Quotation
can't Quotation
see, Quotation
and Quotation
then Quotation
I Quotation
will. Quotation
But Quotation
you Quotation
mustn't Quotation
ever Quotation
tell Quotation
anybody-- Quotation
WILL Quotation
you, Quotation
Tom? Quotation
Now Quotation
you Quotation
won't, Quotation
WILL Quotation
you?" Quotation
"No, Quotation
indeed, Quotation
indeed Quotation
I Quotation
won't. Quotation
Now, Quotation
Becky." Quotation
He Entity
turned O
his O
face O
away. O
She Entity
bent O
timidly O
around O
till O
her O
breath O
stirred O
his O
curls O
and O
whispered, Cue
"I-- Quotation
love-- Quotation
you!" Quotation
Then O
she O
sprang O
away O
and O
ran O
around O
and O
around O
the O
desks O
and O
benches, O
with O
Tom O
after O
her, O
and O
took O
refuge O
in O
a O
corner O
at O
last, O
with O
her O
little O
white O
apron O
to O
her O
face. O
Tom Entity
clasped O
her Entity
about O
her O
neck O
and O
pleaded: Cue
"Now, Quotation
Becky, Quotation
it's Quotation
all Quotation
done-- Quotation
all Quotation
over Quotation
but Quotation
the Quotation
kiss. Quotation
Don't Quotation
you Quotation
be Quotation
afraid Quotation
of Quotation
that-- Quotation
it Quotation
ain't Quotation
anything Quotation
at Quotation
all. Quotation
Please, Quotation
Becky." Quotation
And O
he O
tugged O
at O
her O
apron O
and O
the O
hands. O
By O
and O
by O
she Entity
gave O
up, O
and O
let O
her O
hands O
drop; O
her O
face, O
all O
glowing O
with O
the O
struggle, O
came O
up O
and O
submitted. O
Tom Entity
kissed O
the O
red O
lips O
and O
said: Cue
"Now Quotation
it's Quotation
all Quotation
done, Quotation
Becky. Quotation
And Quotation
always Quotation
after Quotation
this, Quotation
you Quotation
know, Quotation
you Quotation
ain't Quotation
ever Quotation
to Quotation
love Quotation
anybody Quotation
but Quotation
me, Quotation
and Quotation
you Quotation
ain't Quotation
ever Quotation
to Quotation
marry Quotation
anybody Quotation
but Quotation
me, Quotation
ever Quotation
never Quotation
and Quotation
forever. Quotation
Will Quotation
you?" Quotation
"No, Quotation
I'll Quotation
never Quotation
love Quotation
anybody Quotation
but Quotation
you, Quotation
Tom, Quotation
and Quotation
I'll Quotation
never Quotation
marry Quotation
anybody Quotation
but Quotation
you-- Quotation
and Quotation
you Quotation
ain't Quotation
to Quotation
ever Quotation
marry Quotation
anybody Quotation
but Quotation
me, Quotation
either." Quotation
"Certainly. Quotation
Of Quotation
course. Quotation
That's Quotation
PART Quotation
of Quotation
it. Quotation
And Quotation
always Quotation
coming Quotation
to Quotation
school Quotation
or Quotation
when Quotation
we're Quotation
going Quotation
home, Quotation
you're Quotation
to Quotation
walk Quotation
with Quotation
me, Quotation
when Quotation
there Quotation
ain't Quotation
anybody Quotation
looking-- Quotation
and Quotation
you Quotation
choose Quotation
me Quotation
and Quotation
I Quotation
choose Quotation
you Quotation
at Quotation
parties, Quotation
because Quotation
that's Quotation
the Quotation
way Quotation
you Quotation
do Quotation
when Quotation
you're Quotation
engaged." Quotation
"It's Quotation
so Quotation
nice. Quotation
I Quotation
never Quotation
heard Quotation
of Quotation
it Quotation
before." Quotation
"Oh, Quotation
it's Quotation
ever Quotation
so Quotation
gay! Quotation
Why, Quotation
me Quotation
and Quotation
Amy Quotation
Lawrence Quotation
-- Quotation
" Quotation
The O
big O
eyes O
told O
Tom Entity
his O
blunder O
and O
he O
stopped, O
confused. O
"Oh, Quotation
Tom! Quotation
Then Quotation
I Quotation
ain't Quotation
the Quotation
first Quotation
you've Quotation
ever Quotation
been Quotation
engaged Quotation
to!" Quotation
The Entity
child Entity
began O
to O
cry. O
Tom Entity
said: Cue
"Oh, Quotation
don't Quotation
cry, Quotation
Becky, Quotation
I Quotation
don't Quotation
care Quotation
for Quotation
her Quotation
any Quotation
more." Quotation
"Yes, Quotation
you Quotation
do, Quotation
Tom-- Quotation
you Quotation
know Quotation
you Quotation
do." Quotation
Tom O
tried O
to O
put O
his O
arm O
about O
her O
neck, O
but O
she O
pushed O
him O
away O
and O
turned O
her O
face O
to O
the O
wall, O
and O
went O
on O
crying. O
Tom O
tried O
again, O
with O
soothing O
words O
in O
his O
mouth, O
and O
was O
repulsed O
again. O
Then O
his O
pride O
was O
up, O
and O
he O
strode O
away O
and O
went O
outside. O
He O
stood O
about, O
restless O
and O
uneasy, O
for O
a O
while, O
glancing O
at O
the O
door, O
every O
now O
and O
then, O
hoping O
she O
would O
repent O
and O
come O
to O
find O
him. O
But O
she O
did O
not. O
Then O
he O
began O
to O
feel O
badly O
and O
fear O
that O
he O
was O
in O
the O
wrong. O
It O
was O
a O
hard O
struggle O
with O
him O
to O
make O
new O
advances, O
now, O
but O
he O
nerved O
himself O
to O
it O
and O
entered. O
She O
was O
still O
standing O
back O
there O
in O
the O
corner, O
sobbing, O
with O
her O
face O
to O
the O
wall. O
Tom's O
heart O
smote O
him. O
He O
went O
to O
her Entity
and O
stood O
a O
moment, O
not O
knowing O
exactly O
how O
to O
proceed. O
Then O
he Entity
said Cue
hesitatingly: O
"Becky, Quotation
I Quotation
-- Quotation
I Quotation
don't Quotation
care Quotation
for Quotation
anybody Quotation
but Quotation
you." Quotation
No O
reply-- O
but O
sobs. O
"Becky"-- Quotation
pleadingly. O
"Becky, Quotation
won't Quotation
you Quotation
say Quotation
something?" Quotation
More O
sobs. O
Tom Entity
got O
out O
his O
chiefest O
jewel, O
a O
brass O
knob O
from O
the O
top O
of O
an O
andiron, O
and O
passed O
it O
around O
her O
so O
that O
she Entity
could O
see O
it, O
and O
said: Cue
"Please, Quotation
Becky, Quotation
won't Quotation
you Quotation
take Quotation
it?" Quotation
She O
struck O
it O
to O
the O
floor. O
Then O
Tom O
marched O
out O
of O
the O
house O
and O
over O
the O
hills O
and O
far O
away, O
to O
return O
to O
school O
no O
more O
that O
day. O
Presently O
Becky O
began O
to O
suspect. O
She O
ran O
to O
the O
door; O
he O
was O
not O
in O
sight; O
she O
flew O
around O
to O
the O
play-yard; O
he Entity
was O
not O
there. O
Then O
she Entity
called: Cue
"Tom! Quotation
Come Quotation
back, Quotation
Tom!" Quotation
She O
listened O
intently, O
but O
there O
was O
no O
answer. O
She O
had O
no O
companions O
but O
silence O
and O
loneliness. O
So O
she O
sat O
down O
to O
cry O
again O
and O
upbraid O
herself; O
and O
by O
this O
time O
the O
scholars O
began O
to O
gather O
again, O
and O
she O
had O
to O
hide O
her O
griefs O
and O
still O
her O
broken O
heart O
and O
take O
up O
the O
cross O
of O
a O
long, O
dreary, O
aching O
afternoon, O
with O
none O
among O
the O
strangers O
about O
her O
to O
exchange O
sorrows O
with. O
CHAPTER O
VIII O
TOM O
dodged O
hither O
and O
thither O
through O
lanes O
until O
he O
was O
well O
out O
of O
the O
track O
of O
returning O
scholars, O
and O
then O
fell O
into O
a O
moody O
jog. O
He O
crossed O
a O
small O
"branch" O
two O
or O
three O
times, O
because O
of O
a O
prevailing O
juvenile O
superstition O
that O
to O
cross O
water O
baffled O
pursuit. O
Half O
an O
hour O
later O
he O
was O
disappearing O
behind O
the O
Douglas O
mansion O
on O
the O
summit O
of O
Cardiff O
Hill, O
and O
the O
schoolhouse O
was O
hardly O
distinguishable O
away O
off O
in O
the O
valley O
behind O
him. O
He O
entered O
a O
dense O
wood, O
picked O
his O
pathless O
way O
to O
the O
centre O
of O
it, O
and O
sat O
down O
on O
a O
mossy O
spot O
under O
a O
spreading O
oak. O
There O
was O
not O
even O
a O
zephyr O
stirring; O
the O
dead O
noonday O
heat O
had O
even O
stilled O
the O
songs O
of O
the O
birds; O
nature O
lay O
in O
a O
trance O
that O
was O
broken O
by O
no O
sound O
but O
the O
occasional O
far-off O
hammering O
of O
a O
woodpecker, O
and O
this O
seemed O
to O
render O
the O
pervading O
silence O
and O
sense O
of O
loneliness O
the O
more O
profound. O
The O
boy's O
soul O
was O
steeped O
in O
melancholy; O
his O
feelings O
were O
in O
happy O
accord O
with O
his O
surroundings. O
He O
sat O
long O
with O
his O
elbows O
on O
his O
knees O
and O
his O
chin O
in O
his O
hands, O
meditating. O
It O
seemed O
to O
him O
that O
life O
was O
but O
a O
trouble, O
at O
best, O
and O
he O
more O
than O
half O
envied O
Jimmy O
Hodges, O
so O
lately O
released; O
it O
must O
be O
very O
peaceful, O
he O
thought, O
to O
lie O
and O
slumber O
and O
dream O
forever O
and O
ever, O
with O
the O
wind O
whispering O
through O
the O
trees O
and O
caressing O
the O
grass O
and O
the O
flowers O
over O
the O
grave, O
and O
nothing O
to O
bother O
and O
grieve O
about, O
ever O
any O
more. O
If O
he O
only O
had O
a O
clean O
Sunday-school O
record O
he O
could O
be O
willing O
to O
go, O
and O
be O
done O
with O
it O
all. O
Now O
as O
to O
this O
girl. O
What O
had O
he O
done? O
Nothing. O
He O
had O
meant O
the O
best O
in O
the O
world, O
and O
been O
treated O
like O
a O
dog-- O
like O
a O
very O
dog. O
She O
would O
be O
sorry O
some O
day-- O
maybe O
when O
it O
was O
too O
late. O
Ah, O
if O
he O
could O
only O
die O
TEMPORARILY! O
But O
the O
elastic O
heart O
of O
youth O
cannot O
be O
compressed O
into O
one O
constrained O
shape O
long O
at O
a O
time. O
Tom O
presently O
began O
to O
drift O
insensibly O
back O
into O
the O
concerns O
of O
this O
life O
again. O
What O
if O
he O
turned O
his O
back, O
now, O
and O
disappeared O
mysteriously? O
What O
if O
he O
went O
away-- O
ever O
so O
far O
away, O
into O
unknown O
countries O
beyond O
the O
seas-- O
and O
never O
came O
back O
any O
more! O
How O
would O
she O
feel O
then! O
The O
idea O
of O
being O
a O
clown O
recurred O
to O
him O
now, O
only O
to O
fill O
him O
with O
disgust. O
For O
frivolity O
and O
jokes O
and O
spotted O
tights O
were O
an O
offense, O
when O
they O
intruded O
themselves O
upon O
a O
spirit O
that O
was O
exalted O
into O
the O
vague O
august O
realm O
of O
the O
romantic. O
No, O
he O
would O
be O
a O
soldier, O
and O
return O
after O
long O
years, O
all O
war-worn O
and O
illustrious. O
No-- O
better O
still, O
he O
would O
join O
the O
Indians, O
and O
hunt O
buffaloes O
and O
go O
on O
the O
warpath O
in O
the O
mountain O
ranges O
and O
the O
trackless O
great O
plains O
of O
the O
Far O
West, O
and O
away O
in O
the O
future O
come O
back O
a O
great O
chief, O
bristling O
with O
feathers, O
hideous O
with O
paint, O
and O
prance O
into O
Sunday-school, O
some O
drowsy O
summer O
morning, O
with O
a O
bloodcurdling O
war-whoop, O
and O
sear O
the O
eyeballs O
of O
all O
his O
companions O
with O
unappeasable O
envy. O
But O
no, O
there O
was O
something O
gaudier O
even O
than O
this. O
He O
would O
be O
a O
pirate! O
That O
was O
it! O
NOW O
his O
future O
lay O
plain O
before O
him, O
and O
glowing O
with O
unimaginable O
splendor. O
How O
his O
name O
would O
fill O
the O
world, O
and O
make O
people O
shudder! O
How O
gloriously O
he O
would O
go O
plowing O
the O
dancing O
seas, O
in O
his O
long, O
low, O
black-hulled O
racer, O
the O
Spirit O
of O
the O
Storm, O
with O
his O
grisly O
flag O
flying O
at O
the O
fore! O
And O
at O
the O
zenith O
of O
his O
fame, O
how O
he O
would O
suddenly O
appear O
at O
the O
old O
village O
and O
stalk O
into O
church, O
brown O
and O
weather-beaten, O
in O
his O
black O
velvet O
doublet O
and O
trunks, O
his O
great O
jack-boots, O
his O
crimson O
sash, O
his O
belt O
bristling O
with O
horse-pistols, O
his O
crime-rusted O
cutlass O
at O
his O
side, O
his O
slouch O
hat O
with O
waving O
plumes, O
his O
black O
flag O
unfurled, O
with O
the O
skull O
and O
crossbones O
on O
it, O
and O
hear O
with O
swelling O
ecstasy O
the O
whisperings, O
"It's O
Tom O
Sawyer O
the O
Pirate!-- O
the O
Black O
Avenger O
of O
the O
Spanish O
Main!" O
Yes, O
it O
was O
settled; O
his O
career O
was O
determined. O
He O
would O
run O
away O
from O
home O
and O
enter O
upon O
it. O
He O
would O
start O
the O
very O
next O
morning. O
Therefore O
he O
must O
now O
begin O
to O
get O
ready. O
He O
would O
collect O
his O
resources O
together. O
He O
went O
to O
a O
rotten O
log O
near O
at O
hand O
and O
began O
to O
dig O
under O
one O
end O
of O
it O
with O
his O
Barlow O
knife. O
He O
soon O
struck O
wood O
that O
sounded O
hollow. O
He Entity
put O
his O
hand O
there O
and O
uttered Cue
this O
incantation O
impressively: O
"What Quotation
hasn't Quotation
come Quotation
here, Quotation
come! Quotation
What's Quotation
here, Quotation
stay Quotation
here!" Quotation
Then O
he O
scraped O
away O
the O
dirt, O
and O
exposed O
a O
pine O
shingle. O
He O
took O
it O
up O
and O
disclosed O
a O
shapely O
little O
treasure-house O
whose O
bottom O
and O
sides O
were O
of O
shingles. O
In O
it O
lay O
a O
marble. O
Tom's O
astonishment O
was O
boundless! O
He Entity
scratched O
his O
head O
with O
a O
perplexed O
air, O
and O
said: Cue
"Well, Quotation
that Quotation
beats Quotation
anything!" Quotation
Then O
he O
tossed O
the O
marble O
away O
pettishly, O
and O
stood O
cogitating. O
The O
truth O
was, O
that O
a O
superstition O
of O
his O
had O
failed, O
here, O
which O
he O
and O
all O
his O
comrades O
had O
always O
looked O
upon O
as O
infallible. O
If O
you O
buried O
a O
marble O
with O
certain O
necessary O
incantations, O
and O
left O
it O
alone O
a O
fortnight, O
and O
then O
opened O
the O
place O
with O
the O
incantation O
he O
had O
just O
used, O
you O
would O
find O
that O
all O
the O
marbles O
you O
had O
ever O
lost O
had O
gathered O
themselves O
together O
there, O
meantime, O
no O
matter O
how O
widely O
they O
had O
been O
separated. O
But O
now, O
this O
thing O
had O
actually O
and O
unquestionably O
failed. O
Tom's O
whole O
structure O
of O
faith O
was O
shaken O
to O
its O
foundations. O
He O
had O
many O
a O
time O
heard O
of O
this O
thing O
succeeding O
but O
never O
of O
its O
failing O
before. O
It O
did O
not O
occur O
to O
him O
that O
he O
had O
tried O
it O
several O
times O
before, O
himself, O
but O
could O
never O
find O
the O
hiding-places O
afterward. O
He O
puzzled O
over O
the O
matter O
some O
time, O
and O
finally O
decided O
that O
some O
witch O
had O
interfered O
and O
broken O
the O
charm. O
He O
thought O
he O
would O
satisfy O
himself O
on O
that O
point; O
so O
he O
searched O
around O
till O
he O
found O
a O
small O
sandy O
spot O
with O
a O
little O
funnel-shaped O
depression O
in O
it. O
He Entity
laid O
himself O
down O
and O
put O
his O
mouth O
close O
to O
this O
depression O
and O
called-- Cue
"Doodle-bug, Quotation
doodle-bug, Quotation
tell Quotation
me Quotation
what Quotation
I Quotation
want Quotation
to Quotation
know! Quotation
Doodle-bug, Quotation
doodle-bug, Quotation
tell Quotation
me Quotation
what Quotation
I Quotation
want Quotation
to Quotation
know!" Quotation
The O
sand O
began O
to O
work, O
and O
presently O
a O
small O
black O
bug O
appeared O
for O
a O
second O
and O
then O
darted O
under O
again O
in O
a O
fright. O
"He Quotation
dasn't Quotation
tell! Quotation
So Quotation
it Quotation
WAS Quotation
a Quotation
witch Quotation
that Quotation
done Quotation
it. Quotation
I Quotation
just Quotation
knowed Quotation
it." Quotation
He O
well O
knew O
the O
futility O
of O
trying O
to O
contend O
against O
witches, O
so O
he O
gave O
up O
discouraged. O
But O
it O
occurred O
to O
him O
that O
he O
might O
as O
well O
have O
the O
marble O
he O
had O
just O
thrown O
away, O
and O
therefore O
he O
went O
and O
made O
a O
patient O
search O
for O
it. O
But O
he O
could O
not O
find O
it. O
Now O
he O
went O
back O
to O
his O
treasure-house O
and O
carefully O
placed O
himself O
just O
as O
he O
had O
been O
standing O
when O
he O
tossed O
the O
marble O
away; O
then O
he Entity
took O
another O
marble O
from O
his O
pocket O
and O
tossed O
it O
in O
the O
same O
way, O
saying: Cue
"Brother, Quotation
go Quotation
find Quotation
your Quotation
brother!" Quotation
He O
watched O
where O
it O
stopped, O
and O
went O
there O
and O
looked. O
But O
it O
must O
have O
fallen O
short O
or O
gone O
too O
far; O
so O
he O
tried O
twice O
more. O
The O
last O
repetition O
was O
successful. O
The O
two O
marbles O
lay O
within O
a O
foot O
of O
each O
other. O
Just O
here O
the O
blast O
of O
a O
toy O
tin O
trumpet O
came O
faintly O
down O
the O
green O
aisles O
of O
the O
forest. O
Tom O
flung O
off O
his O
jacket O
and O
trousers, O
turned O
a O
suspender O
into O
a O
belt, O
raked O
away O
some O
brush O
behind O
the O
rotten O
log, O
disclosing O
a O
rude O
bow O
and O
arrow, O
a O
lath O
sword O
and O
a O
tin O
trumpet, O
and O
in O
a O
moment O
had O
seized O
these O
things O
and O
bounded O
away, O
barelegged, O
with O
fluttering O
shirt. O
He O
presently O
halted O
under O
a O
great O
elm, O
blew O
an O
answering O
blast, O
and O
then O
began O
to O
tiptoe O
and O
look O
warily O
out, O
this O
way O
and O
that. O
He Entity
said Cue
cautiously-- O
to O
an Entity
imaginary Entity
company: Entity
"Hold, Quotation
my Quotation
merry Quotation
men! Quotation
Keep Quotation
hid Quotation
till Quotation
I Quotation
blow." Quotation
Now O
appeared O
Joe Entity
Harper, Entity
as O
airily O
clad O
and O
elaborately O
armed O
as O
Tom. O
Tom Entity
called: Cue
"Hold! Quotation
Who Quotation
comes Quotation
here Quotation
into Quotation
Sherwood Quotation
Forest Quotation
without Quotation
my Quotation
pass?" Quotation
"Guy Quotation
of Quotation
Guisborne Quotation
wants Quotation
no Quotation
man's Quotation
pass. Quotation
Who Quotation
art Quotation
thou Quotation
that-- Quotation
that Quotation
-- Quotation
" Quotation
"Dares Quotation
to Quotation
hold Quotation
such Quotation
language," Quotation
said Cue
Tom, Entity
prompting-- O
for O
they O
talked O
"by O
the O
book," O
from O
memory. O
"Who Quotation
art Quotation
thou Quotation
that Quotation
dares Quotation
to Quotation
hold Quotation
such Quotation
language?" Quotation
"I, Quotation
indeed! Quotation
I Quotation
am Quotation
Robin Quotation
Hood, Quotation
as Quotation
thy Quotation
caitiff Quotation
carcase Quotation
soon Quotation
shall Quotation
know." Quotation
"Then Quotation
art Quotation
thou Quotation
indeed Quotation
that Quotation
famous Quotation
outlaw? Quotation
Right Quotation
gladly Quotation
will Quotation
I Quotation
dispute Quotation
with Quotation
thee Quotation
the Quotation
passes Quotation
of Quotation
the Quotation
merry Quotation
wood. Quotation
Have Quotation
at Quotation
thee!" Quotation
They O
took O
their O
lath O
swords, O
dumped O
their O
other O
traps O
on O
the O
ground, O
struck O
a O
fencing O
attitude, O
foot O
to O
foot, O
and O
began O
a O
grave, O
careful O
combat, O
"two O
up O
and O
two O
down." O
Presently O
Tom Entity
said: Cue
"Now, Quotation
if Quotation
you've Quotation
got Quotation
the Quotation
hang, Quotation
go Quotation
it Quotation
lively!" Quotation
So O
they O
"went O
it O
lively," O
panting O
and O
perspiring O
with O
the O
work. O
By O
and O
by O
Tom Entity
shouted: Cue
"Fall! Quotation
fall! Quotation
Why Quotation
don't Quotation
you Quotation
fall?" Quotation
"I Quotation
sha'n't! Quotation
Why Quotation
don't Quotation
you Quotation
fall Quotation
yourself? Quotation
You're Quotation
getting Quotation
the Quotation
worst Quotation
of Quotation
it." Quotation
"Why, Quotation
that Quotation
ain't Quotation
anything. Quotation
I Quotation
can't Quotation
fall; Quotation
that Quotation
ain't Quotation
the Quotation
way Quotation
it Quotation
is Quotation
in Quotation
the Quotation
book. Quotation
The Quotation
book Quotation
says, Quotation
'Then Quotation
with Quotation
one Quotation
back-handed Quotation
stroke Quotation
he Quotation
slew Quotation
poor Quotation
Guy Quotation
of Quotation
Guisborne.' Quotation
You're Quotation
to Quotation
turn Quotation
around Quotation
and Quotation
let Quotation
me Quotation
hit Quotation
you Quotation
in Quotation
the Quotation
back." Quotation
There O
was O
no O
getting O
around O
the O
authorities, O
so O
Joe O
turned, O
received O
the O
whack O
and O
fell. O
"Now," Quotation
said Cue
Joe, Entity
getting O
up, O
"you Quotation
got Quotation
to Quotation
let Quotation
me Quotation
kill Quotation
YOU. Quotation
That's Quotation
fair." Quotation
"Why, Quotation
I Quotation
can't Quotation
do Quotation
that, Quotation
it Quotation
ain't Quotation
in Quotation
the Quotation
book." Quotation
"Well, Quotation
it's Quotation
blamed Quotation
mean-- Quotation
that's Quotation
all." Quotation
"Well, Quotation
say, Quotation
Joe, Quotation
you Quotation
can Quotation
be Quotation
Friar Quotation
Tuck Quotation
or Quotation
Much Quotation
the Quotation
miller's Quotation
son, Quotation
and Quotation
lam Quotation
me Quotation
with Quotation
a Quotation
quarter-staff; Quotation
or Quotation
I'll Quotation
be Quotation
the Quotation
Sheriff Quotation
of Quotation
Nottingham Quotation
and Quotation
you Quotation
be Quotation
Robin Quotation
Hood Quotation
a Quotation
little Quotation
while Quotation
and Quotation
kill Quotation
me." Quotation
This O
was O
satisfactory, O
and O
so O
these O
adventures O
were O
carried O
out. O
Then O
Tom O
became O
Robin O
Hood O
again, O
and O
was O
allowed O
by O
the O
treacherous O
nun O
to O
bleed O
his O
strength O
away O
through O
his O
neglected O
wound. O
And O
at O
last O
Joe, Entity
representing O
a O
whole O
tribe O
of O
weeping O
outlaws, O
dragged O
him O
sadly O
forth, O
gave O
his O
bow O
into O
his O
feeble O
hands, O
and O
Tom Entity
said, Cue
"Where Quotation
this Quotation
arrow Quotation
falls, Quotation
there Quotation
bury Quotation
poor Quotation
Robin Quotation
Hood Quotation
under Quotation
the Quotation
greenwood Quotation
tree." Quotation
Then O
he O
shot O
the O
arrow O
and O
fell O
back O
and O
would O
have O
died, O
but O
he O
lit O
on O
a O
nettle O
and O
sprang O
up O
too O
gaily O
for O
a O
corpse. O
The O
boys O
dressed O
themselves, O
hid O
their O
accoutrements, O
and O
went O
off O
grieving O
that O
there O
were O
no O
outlaws O
any O
more, O
and O
wondering O
what O
modern O
civilization O
could O
claim O
to O
have O
done O
to O
compensate O
for O
their O
loss. O
They Entity
said Cue
they Quotation
would Quotation
rather Quotation
be Quotation
outlaws Quotation
a Quotation
year Quotation
in Quotation
Sherwood Quotation
Forest Quotation
than Quotation
President Quotation
of Quotation
the Quotation
United Quotation
States Quotation
forever. Quotation
CHAPTER O
IX O
AT O
half-past O
nine, O
that O
night, O
Tom O
and O
Sid O
were O
sent O
to O
bed, O
as O
usual. O
They O
said O
their O
prayers, O
and O
Sid O
was O
soon O
asleep. O
Tom O
lay O
awake O
and O
waited, O
in O
restless O
impatience. O
When O
it O
seemed O
to O
him O
that O
it O
must O
be O
nearly O
daylight, O
he O
heard O
the O
clock O
strike O
ten! O
This O
was O
despair. O
He O
would O
have O
tossed O
and O
fidgeted, O
as O
his O
nerves O
demanded, O
but O
he O
was O
afraid O
he O
might O
wake O
Sid. O
So O
he O
lay O
still, O
and O
stared O
up O
into O
the O
dark. O
Everything O
was O
dismally O
still. O
By O
and O
by, O
out O
of O
the O
stillness, O
little, O
scarcely O
perceptible O
noises O
began O
to O
emphasize O
themselves. O
The O
ticking O
of O
the O
clock O
began O
to O
bring O
itself O
into O
notice. O
Old O
beams O
began O
to O
crack O
mysteriously. O
The O
stairs O
creaked O
faintly. O
Evidently O
spirits O
were O
abroad. O
A O
measured, O
muffled O
snore O
issued O
from O
Aunt O
Polly's O
chamber. O
And O
now O
the O
tiresome O
chirping O
of O
a O
cricket O
that O
no O
human O
ingenuity O
could O
locate, O
began. O
Next O
the O
ghastly O
ticking O
of O
a O
deathwatch O
in O
the O
wall O
at O
the O
bed's O
head O
made O
Tom O
shudder-- O
it O
meant O
that O
somebody's O
days O
were O
numbered. O
Then O
the O
howl O
of O
a O
far-off O
dog O
rose O
on O
the O
night O
air, O
and O
was O
answered O
by O
a O
fainter O
howl O
from O
a O
remoter O
distance. O
Tom O
was O
in O
an O
agony. O
At O
last O
he O
was O
satisfied O
that O
time O
had O
ceased O
and O
eternity O
begun; O
he O
began O
to O
doze, O
in O
spite O
of O
himself; O
the O
clock O
chimed O
eleven, O
but O
he O
did O
not O
hear O
it. O
And O
then O
there O
came, O
mingling O
with O
his O
half-formed O
dreams, O
a O
most O
melancholy O
caterwauling. O
The O
raising O
of O
a O
neighboring O
window O
disturbed O
him. O
A O
cry Cue
of O
"Scat! Quotation
you Quotation
devil!" Quotation
and O
the O
crash O
of O
an O
empty O
bottle O
against O
the O
back O
of O
his O
aunt's O
woodshed O
brought O
him O
wide O
awake, O
and O
a O
single O
minute O
later O
he O
was O
dressed O
and O
out O
of O
the O
window O
and O
creeping O
along O
the O
roof O
of O
the O
"ell" O
on O
all O
fours. O
He O
"meow'd" O
with O
caution O
once O
or O
twice, O
as O
he O
went; O
then O
jumped O
to O
the O
roof O
of O
the O
woodshed O
and O
thence O
to O
the O
ground. O
Huckleberry O
Finn O
was O
there, O
with O
his O
dead O
cat. O
The O
boys O
moved O
off O
and O
disappeared O
in O
the O
gloom. O
At O
the O
end O
of O
half O
an O
hour O
they O
were O
wading O
through O
the O
tall O
grass O
of O
the O
graveyard. O
It O
was O
a O
graveyard O
of O
the O
old-fashioned O
Western O
kind. O
It O
was O
on O
a O
hill, O
about O
a O
mile O
and O
a O
half O
from O
the O
village. O
It O
had O
a O
crazy O
board O
fence O
around O
it, O
which O
leaned O
inward O
in O
places, O
and O
outward O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
time, O
but O
stood O
upright O
nowhere. O
Grass O
and O
weeds O
grew O
rank O
over O
the O
whole O
cemetery. O
All O
the O
old O
graves O
were O
sunken O
in, O
there O
was O
not O
a O
tombstone O
on O
the O
place; O
round-topped, O
worm-eaten O
boards O
staggered O
over O
the O
graves, O
leaning O
for O
support O
and O
finding O
none. O
"Sacred O
to O
the O
memory O
of" O
So-and-So O
had O
been O
painted O
on O
them O
once, O
but O
it O
could O
no O
longer O
have O
been O
read, O
on O
the O
most O
of O
them, O
now, O
even O
if O
there O
had O
been O
light. O
A O
faint O
wind O
moaned O
through O
the O
trees, O
and O
Tom O
feared O
it O
might O
be O
the O
spirits O
of O
the O
dead, O
complaining O
at O
being O
disturbed. O
The O
boys O
talked O
little, O
and O
only O
under O
their O
breath, O
for O
the O
time O
and O
the O
place O
and O
the O
pervading O
solemnity O
and O
silence O
oppressed O
their O
spirits. O
They O
found O
the O
sharp O
new O
heap O
they O
were O
seeking, O
and O
ensconced O
themselves O
within O
the O
protection O
of O
three O
great O
elms O
that O
grew O
in O
a O
bunch O
within O
a O
few O
feet O
of O
the O
grave. O
Then O
they O
waited O
in O
silence O
for O
what O
seemed O
a O
long O
time. O
The O
hooting O
of O
a O
distant O
owl O
was O
all O
the O
sound O
that O
troubled O
the O
dead O
stillness. O
Tom's O
reflections O
grew O
oppressive. O
He O
must O
force O
some O
talk. O
So O
he Entity
said Cue
in O
a O
whisper: O
"Hucky, Quotation
do Quotation
you Quotation
believe Quotation
the Quotation
dead Quotation
people Quotation
like Quotation
it Quotation
for Quotation
us Quotation
to Quotation
be Quotation
here?" Quotation
Huckleberry Entity
whispered: Cue
"I Quotation
wisht Quotation
I Quotation
knowed. Quotation
It's Quotation
awful Quotation
solemn Quotation
like, Quotation
AIN'T Quotation
it?" Quotation
"I Quotation
bet Quotation
it Quotation
is." Quotation
There O
was O
a O
considerable O
pause, O
while O
the O
boys O
canvassed O
this O
matter O
inwardly. O
Then O
Tom Entity
whispered: Cue
"Say, Quotation
Hucky-- Quotation
do Quotation
you Quotation
reckon Quotation
Hoss Quotation
Williams Quotation
hears Quotation
us Quotation
talking?" Quotation
"O' Quotation
course Quotation
he Quotation
does. Quotation
Least Quotation
his Quotation
sperrit Quotation
does." Quotation
Tom, Entity
after O
a O
pause: O
"I Quotation
wish Quotation
I'd Quotation
said Quotation
Mister Quotation
Williams. Quotation
But Quotation
I Quotation
never Quotation
meant Quotation
any Quotation
harm. Quotation
Everybody Quotation
calls Quotation
him Quotation
Hoss." Quotation
"A Quotation
body Quotation
can't Quotation
be Quotation
too Quotation
partic'lar Quotation
how Quotation
they Quotation
talk Quotation
'bout Quotation
these-yer Quotation
dead Quotation
people, Quotation
Tom." Quotation
This O
was O
a O
damper, O
and O
conversation O
died O
again. O
Presently O
Tom Entity
seized O
his Entity
comrade's Entity
arm O
and O
said: Cue
"Sh!" Quotation
"What Quotation
is Quotation
it, Quotation
Tom?" Quotation
And O
the O
two O
clung O
together O
with O
beating O
hearts. O
"Sh! Quotation
There Quotation
'tis Quotation
again! Quotation
Didn't Quotation
you Quotation
hear Quotation
it?" Quotation
"I Quotation
-- Quotation
" Quotation
"There! Quotation
Now Quotation
you Quotation
hear Quotation
it." Quotation
"Lord, Quotation
Tom, Quotation
they're Quotation
coming! Quotation
They're Quotation
coming, Quotation
sure. Quotation
What'll Quotation
we Quotation
do?" Quotation
"I Quotation
dono. Quotation
Think Quotation
they'll Quotation
see Quotation
us?" Quotation
"Oh, Quotation
Tom, Quotation
they Quotation
can Quotation
see Quotation
in Quotation
the Quotation
dark, Quotation
same Quotation
as Quotation
cats. Quotation
I Quotation
wisht Quotation
I Quotation
hadn't Quotation
come." Quotation
"Oh, Quotation
don't Quotation
be Quotation
afeard. Quotation
I Quotation
don't Quotation
believe Quotation
they'll Quotation
bother Quotation
us. Quotation
We Quotation
ain't Quotation
doing Quotation
any Quotation
harm. Quotation
If Quotation
we Quotation
keep Quotation
perfectly Quotation
still, Quotation
maybe Quotation
they Quotation
won't Quotation
notice Quotation
us Quotation
at Quotation
all." Quotation
"I'll Quotation
try Quotation
to, Quotation
Tom, Quotation
but, Quotation
Lord, Quotation
I'm Quotation
all Quotation
of Quotation
a Quotation
shiver." Quotation
"Listen!" Quotation
The O
boys O
bent O
their O
heads O
together O
and O
scarcely O
breathed. O
A O
muffled O
sound O
of O
voices O
floated O
up O
from O
the O
far O
end O
of O
the O
graveyard. O
"Look! Quotation
See Quotation
there!" Quotation
whispered Cue
Tom. Entity
"What Quotation
is Quotation
it?" Quotation
"It's Quotation
devil-fire. Quotation
Oh, Quotation
Tom, Quotation
this Quotation
is Quotation
awful." Quotation
Some O
vague O
figures O
approached O
through O
the O
gloom, O
swinging O
an O
old-fashioned O
tin O
lantern O
that O
freckled O
the O
ground O
with O
innumerable O
little O
spangles O
of O
light. O
Presently O
Huckleberry Entity
whispered Cue
with O
a O
shudder: O
"It's Quotation
the Quotation
devils Quotation
sure Quotation
enough. Quotation
Three Quotation
of Quotation
'em! Quotation
Lordy, Quotation
Tom, Quotation
we're Quotation
goners! Quotation
Can Quotation
you Quotation
pray?" Quotation
"I'll Quotation
try, Quotation
but Quotation
don't Quotation
you Quotation
be Quotation
afeard. Quotation
They Quotation
ain't Quotation
going Quotation
to Quotation
hurt Quotation
us. Quotation
'Now Quotation
I Quotation
lay Quotation
me Quotation
down Quotation
to Quotation
sleep, Quotation
I-- Quotation
'" Quotation
"Sh!" Quotation
"What Quotation
is Quotation
it, Quotation
Huck?" Quotation
"They're Quotation
HUMANS! Quotation
One Quotation
of Quotation
'em Quotation
is, Quotation
anyway. Quotation
One Quotation
of Quotation
'em's Quotation
old Quotation
Muff Quotation
Potter's Quotation
voice." Quotation
"No-- Quotation
'tain't Quotation
so, Quotation
is Quotation
it?" Quotation
"I Quotation
bet Quotation
I Quotation
know Quotation
it. Quotation
Don't Quotation
you Quotation
stir Quotation
nor Quotation
budge. Quotation
He Quotation
ain't Quotation
sharp Quotation
enough Quotation
to Quotation
notice Quotation
us. Quotation
Drunk, Quotation
the Quotation
same Quotation
as Quotation
usual, Quotation
likely-- Quotation
blamed Quotation
old Quotation
rip!" Quotation
"All Quotation
right, Quotation
I'll Quotation
keep Quotation
still. Quotation
Now Quotation
they're Quotation
stuck. Quotation
Can't Quotation
find Quotation
it. Quotation
Here Quotation
they Quotation
come Quotation
again. Quotation
Now Quotation
they're Quotation
hot. Quotation
Cold Quotation
again. Quotation
Hot Quotation
again. Quotation
Red Quotation
hot! Quotation
They're Quotation
p'inted Quotation
right, Quotation
this Quotation
time. Quotation
Say, Quotation
Huck, Quotation
I Quotation
know Quotation
another Quotation
o' Quotation
them Quotation
voices; Quotation
it's Quotation
Injun Quotation
Joe." Quotation
"That's Quotation
so-- Quotation
that Quotation
murderin' Quotation
half-breed! Quotation
I'd Quotation
druther Quotation
they Quotation
was Quotation
devils Quotation
a Quotation
dern Quotation
sight. Quotation
What Quotation
kin Quotation
they Quotation
be Quotation
up Quotation
to?" Quotation
The O
whisper O
died O
wholly O
out, O
now, O
for O
the O
three O
men O
had O
reached O
the O
grave O
and O
stood O
within O
a O
few O
feet O
of O
the O
boys' O
hiding-place. O
"Here Quotation
it Quotation
is," Quotation
said Cue
the O
third O
voice; O
and O
the Entity
owner Entity
of Entity
it Entity
held O
the O
lantern O
up O
and O
revealed O
the O
face O
of O
young O
Doctor O
Robinson. O
Potter Entity
and O
Injun Entity
Joe Entity
were O
carrying O
a O
handbarrow O
with O
a O
rope O
and O
a O
couple O
of O
shovels O
on O
it. O
They O
cast O
down O
their O
load O
and O
began O
to O
open O
the O
grave. O
The O
doctor O
put O
the O
lantern O
at O
the O
head O
of O
the O
grave O
and O
came O
and O
sat O
down O
with O
his O
back O
against O
one O
of O
the O
elm O
trees. O
He O
was O
so O
close O
the O
boys O
could O
have O
touched O
him. O
"Hurry, Quotation
men!" Quotation
he Entity
said, Cue
in O
a O
low O
voice; O
"the Quotation
moon Quotation
might Quotation
come Quotation
out Quotation
at Quotation
any Quotation
moment." Quotation
They Entity
growled O
a O
response O
and O
went O
on O
digging. O
For O
some O
time O
there O
was O
no O
noise O
but O
the O
grating O
sound O
of O
the O
spades O
discharging O
their O
freight O
of O
mould O
and O
gravel. O
It O
was O
very O
monotonous. O
Finally O
a O
spade O
struck O
upon O
the O
coffin O
with O
a O
dull O
woody O
accent, O
and O
within O
another O
minute O
or O
two O
the O
men O
had O
hoisted O
it O
out O
on O
the O
ground. O
They O
pried O
off O
the O
lid O
with O
their O
shovels, O
got O
out O
the O
body O
and O
dumped O
it O
rudely O
on O
the O
ground. O
The O
moon O
drifted O
from O
behind O
the O
clouds O
and O
exposed O
the O
pallid O
face. O
The O
barrow O
was O
got O
ready O
and O
the O
corpse O
placed O
on O
it, O
covered O
with O
a O
blanket, O
and O
bound O
to O
its O
place O
with O
the O
rope. O
Potter Entity
took O
out O
a O
large O
spring-knife O
and O
cut O
off O
the O
dangling O
end O
of O
the O
rope O
and O
then O
said: Cue
"Now Quotation
the Quotation
cussed Quotation
thing's Quotation
ready, Quotation
Sawbones, Quotation
and Quotation
you'll Quotation
just Quotation
out Quotation
with Quotation
another Quotation
five, Quotation
or Quotation
here Quotation
she Quotation
stays." Quotation
"That's Quotation
the Quotation
talk!" Quotation
said Cue
Injun Entity
Joe. Entity
"Look Quotation
here, Quotation
what Quotation
does Quotation
this Quotation
mean?" Quotation
said Cue
the Entity
doctor. Entity
"You Quotation
required Quotation
your Quotation
pay Quotation
in Quotation
advance, Quotation
and Quotation
I've Quotation
paid Quotation
you." Quotation
"Yes, Quotation
and Quotation
you Quotation
done Quotation
more Quotation
than Quotation
that," Quotation
said Cue
Injun Entity
Joe, Entity
approaching O
the Entity
doctor, Entity
who O
was O
now O
standing. O
"Five Quotation
years Quotation
ago Quotation
you Quotation
drove Quotation
me Quotation
away Quotation
from Quotation
your Quotation
father's Quotation
kitchen Quotation
one Quotation
night, Quotation
when Quotation
I Quotation
come Quotation
to Quotation
ask Quotation
for Quotation
something Quotation
to Quotation
eat, Quotation
and Quotation
you Quotation
said Quotation
I Quotation
warn't Quotation
there Quotation
for Quotation
any Quotation
good; Quotation
and Quotation
when Quotation
I Quotation
swore Quotation
I'd Quotation
get Quotation
even Quotation
with Quotation
you Quotation
if Quotation
it Quotation
took Quotation
a Quotation
hundred Quotation
years, Quotation
your Quotation
father Quotation
had Quotation
me Quotation
jailed Quotation
for Quotation
a Quotation
vagrant. Quotation
Did Quotation
you Quotation
think Quotation
I'd Quotation
forget? Quotation
The Quotation
Injun Quotation
blood Quotation
ain't Quotation
in Quotation
me Quotation
for Quotation
nothing. Quotation
And Quotation
now Quotation
I've Quotation
GOT Quotation
you, Quotation
and Quotation
you Quotation
got Quotation
to Quotation
SETTLE, Quotation
you Quotation
know!" Quotation
He O
was O
threatening O
the O
doctor, O
with O
his O
fist O
in O
his O
face, O
by O
this O
time. O
The O
doctor O
struck O
out O
suddenly O
and O
stretched O
the O
ruffian O
on O
the O
ground. O
Potter Entity
dropped O
his O
knife, O
and O
exclaimed: Cue
"Here, Quotation
now, Quotation
don't Quotation
you Quotation
hit Quotation
my Quotation
pard!" Quotation
and O
the O
next O
moment O
he O
had O
grappled O
with O
the Entity
doctor Entity
and O
the O
two O
were O
struggling O
with O
might O
and O
main, O
trampling O
the O
grass O
and O
tearing O
the O
ground O
with O
their O
heels. O
Injun O
Joe O
sprang O
to O
his O
feet, O
his O
eyes O
flaming O
with O
passion, O
snatched O
up O
Potter's O
knife, O
and O
went O
creeping, O
catlike O
and O
stooping, O
round O
and O
round O
about O
the O
combatants, O
seeking O
an O
opportunity. O
All O
at O
once O
the O
doctor O
flung O
himself O
free, O
seized O
the O
heavy O
headboard O
of O
Williams' O
grave O
and O
felled O
Potter O
to O
the O
earth O
with O
it-- O
and O
in O
the O
same O
instant O
the O
half-breed O
saw O
his O
chance O
and O
drove O
the O
knife O
to O
the O
hilt O
in O
the O
young O
man's O
breast. O
He O
reeled O
and O
fell O
partly O
upon O
Potter, O
flooding O
him O
with O
his O
blood, O
and O
in O
the O
same O
moment O
the O
clouds O
blotted O
out O
the O
dreadful O
spectacle O
and O
the O
two O
frightened O
boys O
went O
speeding O
away O
in O
the O
dark. O
Presently, O
when O
the O
moon O
emerged O
again, O
Injun O
Joe O
was O
standing O
over O
the O
two O
forms, O
contemplating O
them. O
The Entity
doctor Entity
murmured O
inarticulately, O
gave O
a O
long O
gasp O
or O
two O
and O
was O
still. O
The Entity
half-breed Entity
muttered: Cue
"THAT Quotation
score Quotation
is Quotation
settled-- Quotation
damn Quotation
you." Quotation
Then O
he O
robbed O
the O
body. O
After O
which O
he O
put O
the O
fatal O
knife O
in O
Potter's O
open O
right O
hand, O
and O
sat O
down O
on O
the O
dismantled O
coffin. O
Three O
--four-- O
five O
minutes O
passed, O
and O
then O
Potter O
began O
to O
stir O
and O
moan. O
His O
hand O
closed O
upon O
the O
knife; O
he O
raised O
it, O
glanced O
at O
it, O
and O
let O
it O
fall, O
with O
a O
shudder. O
Then O
he O
sat O
up, O
pushing O
the O
body O
from O
him, O
and O
gazed O
at O
it, O
and O
then O
around O
him, O
confusedly. O
His O
eyes O
met O
Joe's. O
"Lord, Quotation
how Quotation
is Quotation
this, Quotation
Joe?" Quotation
he Entity
said. Cue
"It's Quotation
a Quotation
dirty Quotation
business," Quotation
said Cue
Joe, Entity
without O
moving. O
"What Quotation
did Quotation
you Quotation
do Quotation
it Quotation
for?" Quotation
"I! Quotation
I Quotation
never Quotation
done Quotation
it!" Quotation
"Look Quotation
here! Quotation
That Quotation
kind Quotation
of Quotation
talk Quotation
won't Quotation
wash." Quotation
Potter Entity
trembled O
and O
grew O
white. O
"I Quotation
thought Quotation
I'd Quotation
got Quotation
sober. Quotation
I'd Quotation
no Quotation
business Quotation
to Quotation
drink Quotation
to-night. Quotation
But Quotation
it's Quotation
in Quotation
my Quotation
head Quotation
yet-- Quotation
worse'n Quotation
when Quotation
we Quotation
started Quotation
here. Quotation
I'm Quotation
all Quotation
in Quotation
a Quotation
muddle; Quotation
can't Quotation
recollect Quotation
anything Quotation
of Quotation
it, Quotation
hardly. Quotation
Tell Quotation
me, Quotation
Joe-- Quotation
HONEST, Quotation
now, Quotation
old Quotation
feller-- Quotation
did Quotation
I Quotation
do Quotation
it? Quotation
Joe, Quotation
I Quotation
never Quotation
meant Quotation
to-- Quotation
'pon Quotation
my Quotation
soul Quotation
and Quotation
honor, Quotation
I Quotation
never Quotation
meant Quotation
to, Quotation
Joe. Quotation
Tell Quotation
me Quotation
how Quotation
it Quotation
was, Quotation
Joe. Quotation
Oh, Quotation
it's Quotation
awful-- Quotation
and Quotation
him Quotation
so Quotation
young Quotation
and Quotation
promising." Quotation
"Why, Quotation
you Quotation
two Quotation
was Quotation
scuffling, Quotation
and Quotation
he Quotation
fetched Quotation
you Quotation
one Quotation
with Quotation
the Quotation
headboard Quotation
and Quotation
you Quotation
fell Quotation
flat; Quotation
and Quotation
then Quotation
up Quotation
you Quotation
come, Quotation
all Quotation
reeling Quotation
and Quotation
staggering Quotation
like, Quotation
and Quotation
snatched Quotation
the Quotation
knife Quotation
and Quotation
jammed Quotation
it Quotation
into Quotation
him, Quotation
just Quotation
as Quotation
he Quotation
fetched Quotation
you Quotation
another Quotation
awful Quotation
clip-- Quotation
and Quotation
here Quotation
you've Quotation
laid, Quotation
as Quotation
dead Quotation
as Quotation
a Quotation
wedge Quotation
til Quotation
now." Quotation
"Oh, Quotation
I Quotation
didn't Quotation
know Quotation
what Quotation
I Quotation
was Quotation
a-doing. Quotation
I Quotation
wish Quotation
I Quotation
may Quotation
die Quotation
this Quotation
minute Quotation
if Quotation
I Quotation
did. Quotation
It Quotation
was Quotation
all Quotation
on Quotation
account Quotation
of Quotation
the Quotation
whiskey Quotation
and Quotation
the Quotation
excitement, Quotation
I Quotation
reckon. Quotation
I Quotation
never Quotation
used Quotation
a Quotation
weepon Quotation
in Quotation
my Quotation
life Quotation
before, Quotation
Joe. Quotation
I've Quotation
fought, Quotation
but Quotation
never Quotation
with Quotation
weepons. Quotation
They'll Quotation
all Quotation
say Quotation
that. Quotation
Joe, Quotation
don't Quotation
tell! Quotation
Say Quotation
you Quotation
won't Quotation
tell, Quotation
Joe-- Quotation
that's Quotation
a Quotation
good Quotation
feller. Quotation
I Quotation
always Quotation
liked Quotation
you, Quotation
Joe, Quotation
and Quotation
stood Quotation
up Quotation
for Quotation
you, Quotation
too. Quotation
Don't Quotation
you Quotation
remember? Quotation
You Quotation
WON'T Quotation
tell, Quotation
WILL Quotation
you, Quotation
Joe?" Quotation
And O
the O
poor O
creature O
dropped O
on O
his O
knees O
before O
the O
stolid O
murderer, O
and O
clasped O
his O
appealing O
hands. O
"No, Quotation
you've Quotation
always Quotation
been Quotation
fair Quotation
and Quotation
square Quotation
with Quotation
me, Quotation
Muff Quotation
Potter, Quotation
and Quotation
I Quotation
won't Quotation
go Quotation
back Quotation
on Quotation
you. Quotation
There, Quotation
now, Quotation
that's Quotation
as Quotation
fair Quotation
as Quotation
a Quotation
man Quotation
can Quotation
say." Quotation
"Oh, Quotation
Joe, Quotation
you're Quotation
an Quotation
angel. Quotation
I'll Quotation
bless Quotation
you Quotation
for Quotation
this Quotation
the Quotation
longest Quotation
day Quotation
I Quotation
live." Quotation
And O
Potter Entity
began O
to O
cry. O
"Come, Quotation
now, Quotation
that's Quotation
enough Quotation
of Quotation
that. Quotation
This Quotation
ain't Quotation
any Quotation
time Quotation
for Quotation
blubbering. Quotation
You Quotation
be Quotation
off Quotation
yonder Quotation
way Quotation
and Quotation
I'll Quotation
go Quotation
this. Quotation
Move, Quotation
now, Quotation
and Quotation
don't Quotation
leave Quotation
any Quotation
tracks Quotation
behind Quotation
you." Quotation
Potter Entity
started O
on O
a O
trot O
that O
quickly O
increased O
to O
a O
run. O
The O
half-breed O
stood O
looking O
after O
him. O
He Entity
muttered: Cue
"If Quotation
he's Quotation
as Quotation
much Quotation
stunned Quotation
with Quotation
the Quotation
lick Quotation
and Quotation
fuddled Quotation
with Quotation
the Quotation
rum Quotation
as Quotation
he Quotation
had Quotation
the Quotation
look Quotation
of Quotation
being, Quotation
he Quotation
won't Quotation
think Quotation
of Quotation
the Quotation
knife Quotation
till Quotation
he's Quotation
gone Quotation
so Quotation
far Quotation
he'll Quotation
be Quotation
afraid Quotation
to Quotation
come Quotation
back Quotation
after Quotation
it Quotation
to Quotation
such Quotation
a Quotation
place Quotation
by Quotation
himself Quotation
--chicken-heart!" Quotation
Two O
or O
three O
minutes O
later O
the O
murdered O
man, O
the O
blanketed O
corpse, O
the O
lidless O
coffin, O
and O
the O
open O
grave O
were O
under O
no O
inspection O
but O
the O
moon's. O
The O
stillness O
was O
complete O
again, O
too. O
CHAPTER O
X O
THE O
two O
boys O
flew O
on O
and O
on, O
toward O
the O
village, O
speechless O
with O
horror. O
They O
glanced O
backward O
over O
their O
shoulders O
from O
time O
to O
time, O
apprehensively, O
as O
if O
they O
feared O
they O
might O
be O
followed. O
Every O
stump O
that O
started O
up O
in O
their O
path O
seemed O
a O
man O
and O
an O
enemy, O
and O
made O
them O
catch O
their O
breath; O
and O
as O
they O
sped O
by O
some O
outlying O
cottages O
that O
lay O
near O
the O
village, O
the O
barking O
of O
the O
aroused O
watch-dogs O
seemed O
to O
give O
wings O
to O
their O
feet. O
"If Quotation
we Quotation
can Quotation
only Quotation
get Quotation
to Quotation
the Quotation
old Quotation
tannery Quotation
before Quotation
we Quotation
break Quotation
down!" Quotation
whispered Cue
Tom, Entity
in O
short O
catches O
between O
breaths. O
"I Quotation
can't Quotation
stand Quotation
it Quotation
much Quotation
longer." Quotation
Huckleberry's Entity
hard O
pantings O
were O
his O
only O
reply, O
and O
the O
boys O
fixed O
their O
eyes O
on O
the O
goal O
of O
their O
hopes O
and O
bent O
to O
their O
work O
to O
win O
it. O
They O
gained O
steadily O
on O
it, O
and O
at O
last, O
breast O
to O
breast, O
they O
burst O
through O
the O
open O
door O
and O
fell O
grateful O
and O
exhausted O
in O
the O
sheltering O
shadows O
beyond. O
By O
and O
by O
their O
pulses O
slowed O
down, O
and O
Tom Entity
whispered: Cue
"Huckleberry, Quotation
what Quotation
do Quotation
you Quotation
reckon'll Quotation
come Quotation
of Quotation
this?" Quotation
"If Quotation
Doctor Quotation
Robinson Quotation
dies, Quotation
I Quotation
reckon Quotation
hanging'll Quotation
come Quotation
of Quotation
it." Quotation
"Do Quotation
you Quotation
though?" Quotation
"Why, Quotation
I Quotation
KNOW Quotation
it, Quotation
Tom." Quotation
Tom O
thought O
a O
while, O
then O
he Entity
said: Cue
"Who'll Quotation
tell? Quotation
We?" Quotation
"What Quotation
are Quotation
you Quotation
talking Quotation
about? Quotation
S'pose Quotation
something Quotation
happened Quotation
and Quotation
Injun Quotation
Joe Quotation
DIDN'T Quotation
hang? Quotation
Why, Quotation
he'd Quotation
kill Quotation
us Quotation
some Quotation
time Quotation
or Quotation
other, Quotation
just Quotation
as Quotation
dead Quotation
sure Quotation
as Quotation
we're Quotation
a Quotation
laying Quotation
here." Quotation
"That's Quotation
just Quotation
what Quotation
I Quotation
was Quotation
thinking Quotation
to Quotation
myself, Quotation
Huck." Quotation
"If Quotation
anybody Quotation
tells, Quotation
let Quotation
Muff Quotation
Potter Quotation
do Quotation
it, Quotation
if Quotation
he's Quotation
fool Quotation
enough. Quotation
He's Quotation
generally Quotation
drunk Quotation
enough." Quotation
Tom O
said O
nothing-- O
went O
on O
thinking. O
Presently O
he Entity
whispered: Cue
"Huck, Quotation
Muff Quotation
Potter Quotation
don't Quotation
know Quotation
it. Quotation
How Quotation
can Quotation
he Quotation
tell?" Quotation
"What's Quotation
the Quotation
reason Quotation
he Quotation
don't Quotation
know Quotation
it?" Quotation
"Because Quotation
he'd Quotation
just Quotation
got Quotation
that Quotation
whack Quotation
when Quotation
Injun Quotation
Joe Quotation
done Quotation
it. Quotation
D'you Quotation
reckon Quotation
he Quotation
could Quotation
see Quotation
anything? Quotation
D'you Quotation
reckon Quotation
he Quotation
knowed Quotation
anything?" Quotation
"By Quotation
hokey, Quotation
that's Quotation
so, Quotation
Tom!" Quotation
"And Quotation
besides, Quotation
look-a-here-- Quotation
maybe Quotation
that Quotation
whack Quotation
done Quotation
for Quotation
HIM!" Quotation
"No, Quotation
'taint Quotation
likely, Quotation
Tom. Quotation
He Quotation
had Quotation
liquor Quotation
in Quotation
him; Quotation
I Quotation
could Quotation
see Quotation
that; Quotation
and Quotation
besides, Quotation
he Quotation
always Quotation
has. Quotation
Well, Quotation
when Quotation
pap's Quotation
full, Quotation
you Quotation
might Quotation
take Quotation
and Quotation
belt Quotation
him Quotation
over Quotation
the Quotation
head Quotation
with Quotation
a Quotation
church Quotation
and Quotation
you Quotation
couldn't Quotation
phase Quotation
him. Quotation
He Quotation
says Quotation
so, Quotation
his Quotation
own Quotation
self. Quotation
So Quotation
it's Quotation
the Quotation
same Quotation
with Quotation
Muff Quotation
Potter, Quotation
of Quotation
course. Quotation
But Quotation
if Quotation
a Quotation
man Quotation
was Quotation
dead Quotation
sober, Quotation
I Quotation
reckon Quotation
maybe Quotation
that Quotation
whack Quotation
might Quotation
fetch Quotation
him; Quotation
I Quotation
dono." Quotation
After O
another O
reflective O
silence, O
Tom Entity
said: Cue
"Hucky, Quotation
you Quotation
sure Quotation
you Quotation
can Quotation
keep Quotation
mum?" Quotation
"Tom, Quotation
we Quotation
GOT Quotation
to Quotation
keep Quotation
mum. Quotation
You Quotation
know Quotation
that. Quotation
That Quotation
Injun Quotation
devil Quotation
wouldn't Quotation
make Quotation
any Quotation
more Quotation
of Quotation
drownding Quotation
us Quotation
than Quotation
a Quotation
couple Quotation
of Quotation
cats, Quotation
if Quotation
we Quotation
was Quotation
to Quotation
squeak Quotation
'bout Quotation
this Quotation
and Quotation
they Quotation
didn't Quotation
hang Quotation
him. Quotation
Now, Quotation
look-a-here, Quotation
Tom, Quotation
less Quotation
take Quotation
and Quotation
swear Quotation
to Quotation
one Quotation
another-- Quotation
that's Quotation
what Quotation
we Quotation
got Quotation
to Quotation
do-- Quotation
swear Quotation
to Quotation
keep Quotation
mum." Quotation
"I'm Quotation
agreed. Quotation
It's Quotation
the Quotation
best Quotation
thing. Quotation
Would Quotation
you Quotation
just Quotation
hold Quotation
hands Quotation
and Quotation
swear Quotation
that Quotation
we Quotation
-- Quotation
" Quotation
"Oh Quotation
no, Quotation
that Quotation
wouldn't Quotation
do Quotation
for Quotation
this. Quotation
That's Quotation
good Quotation
enough Quotation
for Quotation
little Quotation
rubbishy Quotation
common Quotation
things-- Quotation
specially Quotation
with Quotation
gals, Quotation
cuz Quotation
THEY Quotation
go Quotation
back Quotation
on Quotation
you Quotation
anyway, Quotation
and Quotation
blab Quotation
if Quotation
they Quotation
get Quotation
in Quotation
a Quotation
huff-- Quotation
but Quotation
there Quotation
orter Quotation
be Quotation
writing Quotation
'bout Quotation
a Quotation
big Quotation
thing Quotation
like Quotation
this. Quotation
And Quotation
blood." Quotation
Tom's O
whole O
being O
applauded O
this O
idea. O
It O
was O
deep, O
and O
dark, O
and O
awful; O
the O
hour, O
the O
circumstances, O
the O
surroundings, O
were O
in O
keeping O
with O
it. O
He O
picked O
up O
a O
clean O
pine O
shingle O
that O
lay O
in O
the O
moonlight, O
took O
a O
little O
fragment O
of O
"red O
keel" O
out O
of O
his O
pocket, O
got O
the O
moon O
on O
his O
work, O
and O
painfully O
scrawled O
these O
lines, O
emphasizing O
each O
slow O
down-stroke O
by O
clamping O
his O
tongue O
between O
his O
teeth, O
and O
letting O
up O
the O
pressure O
on O
the O
up-strokes. O
[See O
next O
page.] O
"Huck O
Finn O
and O
Tom O
Sawyer O
swears O
they O
will O
keep O
mum O
about O
This O
and O
They O
wish O
They O
may O
Drop O
down O
dead O
in O
Their O
Tracks O
if O
They O
ever O
Tell O
and O
Rot." O
Huckleberry Entity
was O
filled O
with O
admiration O
of O
Tom's O
facility O
in O
writing, O
and O
the O
sublimity O
of O
his O
language. O
He O
at O
once O
took O
a O
pin O
from O
his O
lapel O
and O
was O
going O
to O
prick O
his O
flesh, O
but O
Tom Entity
said: Cue
"Hold Quotation
on! Quotation
Don't Quotation
do Quotation
that. Quotation
A Quotation
pin's Quotation
brass. Quotation
It Quotation
might Quotation
have Quotation
verdigrease Quotation
on Quotation
it." Quotation
"What's Quotation
verdigrease?" Quotation
"It's Quotation
p'ison. Quotation
That's Quotation
what Quotation
it Quotation
is. Quotation
You Quotation
just Quotation
swaller Quotation
some Quotation
of Quotation
it Quotation
once Quotation
--you'll Quotation
see." Quotation
So O
Tom O
unwound O
the O
thread O
from O
one O
of O
his O
needles, O
and O
each O
boy O
pricked O
the O
ball O
of O
his O
thumb O
and O
squeezed O
out O
a O
drop O
of O
blood. O
In O
time, O
after O
many O
squeezes, O
Tom Entity
managed O
to O
sign O
his O
initials, O
using O
the O
ball O
of O
his O
little O
finger O
for O
a O
pen. O
Then O
he O
showed O
Huckleberry O
how O
to O
make O
an O
H O
and O
an O
F, O
and O
the O
oath O
was O
complete. O
They O
buried O
the O
shingle O
close O
to O
the O
wall, O
with O
some O
dismal O
ceremonies O
and O
incantations, O
and O
the O
fetters O
that O
bound O
their O
tongues O
were O
considered O
to O
be O
locked O
and O
the O
key O
thrown O
away. O
A O
figure O
crept O
stealthily O
through O
a O
break O
in O
the O
other O
end O
of O
the O
ruined O
building, O
now, O
but O
they O
did O
not O
notice O
it. O
"Tom," Quotation
whispered Cue
Huckleberry, Entity
"does Quotation
this Quotation
keep Quotation
us Quotation
from Quotation
EVER Quotation
telling Quotation
--ALWAYS?" Quotation
"Of Quotation
course Quotation
it Quotation
does. Quotation
It Quotation
don't Quotation
make Quotation
any Quotation
difference Quotation
WHAT Quotation
happens, Quotation
we Quotation
got Quotation
to Quotation
keep Quotation
mum. Quotation
We'd Quotation
drop Quotation
down Quotation
dead-- Quotation
don't Quotation
YOU Quotation
know Quotation
that?" Quotation
"Yes, Quotation
I Quotation
reckon Quotation
that's Quotation
so." Quotation
They O
continued O
to O
whisper O
for O
some O
little O
time. O
Presently O
a O
dog O
set O
up O
a O
long, O
lugubrious O
howl O
just O
outside-- O
within O
ten O
feet O
of O
them. O
The O
boys O
clasped O
each O
other O
suddenly, O
in O
an O
agony O
of O
fright. O
"Which Quotation
of Quotation
us Quotation
does Quotation
he Quotation
mean?" Quotation
gasped Cue
Huckleberry. Entity
"I Quotation
dono-- Quotation
peep Quotation
through Quotation
the Quotation
crack. Quotation
Quick!" Quotation
"No, Quotation
YOU, Quotation
Tom!" Quotation
"I Quotation
can't Quotation
-- Quotation
I Quotation
can't Quotation
DO Quotation
it, Quotation
Huck!" Quotation
"Please, Quotation
Tom. Quotation
There Quotation
'tis Quotation
again!" Quotation
"Oh, Quotation
lordy, Quotation
I'm Quotation
thankful!" Quotation
whispered Cue
Tom. Entity
"I Quotation
know Quotation
his Quotation
voice. Quotation
It's Quotation
Bull Quotation
Harbison." Quotation
[ O
If O
Mr. O
Harbison O
owned O
a O
slave O
named O
Bull, O
Tom O
would O
have O
spoken O
of O
him O
as O
"Harbison's O
Bull," O
but O
a O
son O
or O
a O
dog O
of O
that O
name O
was O
"Bull O
Harbison."] O
"Oh, Quotation
that's Quotation
good Quotation
-- Quotation
I Quotation
tell Quotation
you, Quotation
Tom, Quotation
I Quotation
was Quotation
most Quotation
scared Quotation
to Quotation
death; Quotation
I'd Quotation
a Quotation
bet Quotation
anything Quotation
it Quotation
was Quotation
a Quotation
STRAY Quotation
dog." Quotation
The O
dog O
howled O
again. O
The O
boys' O
hearts O
sank O
once O
more. O
"Oh, Quotation
my! Quotation
that Quotation
ain't Quotation
no Quotation
Bull Quotation
Harbison!" Quotation
whispered Cue
Huckleberry. Entity
"DO, Quotation
Tom!" Quotation
Tom, O
quaking O
with O
fear, O
yielded, O
and O
put O
his O
eye O
to O
the O
crack. O
His O
whisper O
was O
hardly O
audible O
when O
he Entity
said: Cue
"Oh, Quotation
Huck, Quotation
IT Quotation
S Quotation
A Quotation
STRAY Quotation
DOG!" Quotation
"Quick, Quotation
Tom, Quotation
quick! Quotation
Who Quotation
does Quotation
he Quotation
mean?" Quotation
"Huck, Quotation
he Quotation
must Quotation
mean Quotation
us Quotation
both-- Quotation
we're Quotation
right Quotation
together." Quotation
"Oh, Quotation
Tom, Quotation
I Quotation
reckon Quotation
we're Quotation
goners. Quotation
I Quotation
reckon Quotation
there Quotation
ain't Quotation
no Quotation
mistake Quotation
'bout Quotation
where Quotation
I'LL Quotation
go Quotation
to. Quotation
I Quotation
been Quotation
so Quotation
wicked." Quotation
"Dad Quotation
fetch Quotation
it! Quotation
This Quotation
comes Quotation
of Quotation
playing Quotation
hookey Quotation
and Quotation
doing Quotation
everything Quotation
a Quotation
feller's Quotation
told Quotation
NOT Quotation
to Quotation
do. Quotation
I Quotation
might Quotation
a Quotation
been Quotation
good, Quotation
like Quotation
Sid, Quotation
if Quotation
I'd Quotation
a Quotation
tried Quotation
--but Quotation
no, Quotation
I Quotation
wouldn't, Quotation
of Quotation
course. Quotation
But Quotation
if Quotation
ever Quotation
I Quotation
get Quotation
off Quotation
this Quotation
time, Quotation
I Quotation
lay Quotation
I'll Quotation
just Quotation
WALLER Quotation
in Quotation
Sunday-schools!" Quotation
And O
Tom Entity
began O
to O
snuffle O
a O
little. O
"YOU Quotation
bad!" Quotation
and O
Huckleberry Entity
began O
to O
snuffle O
too. O
"Consound Quotation
it, Quotation
Tom Quotation
Sawyer, Quotation
you're Quotation
just Quotation
old Quotation
pie, Quotation
'longside Quotation
o' Quotation
what Quotation
I Quotation
am. Quotation
Oh, Quotation
LORDY, Quotation
lordy, Quotation
lordy, Quotation
I Quotation
wisht Quotation
I Quotation
only Quotation
had Quotation
half Quotation
your Quotation
chance." Quotation
Tom Entity
choked O
off O
and O
whispered: Cue
"Look, Quotation
Hucky, Quotation
look! Quotation
He's Quotation
got Quotation
his Quotation
BACK Quotation
to Quotation
us!" Quotation
Hucky Entity
looked, O
with O
joy O
in O
his O
heart. O
"Well, Quotation
he Quotation
has, Quotation
by Quotation
jingoes! Quotation
Did Quotation
he Quotation
before?" Quotation
"Yes, Quotation
he Quotation
did. Quotation
But Quotation
I, Quotation
like Quotation
a Quotation
fool, Quotation
never Quotation
thought. Quotation
Oh, Quotation
this Quotation
is Quotation
bully, Quotation
you Quotation
know. Quotation
NOW Quotation
who Quotation
can Quotation
he Quotation
mean?" Quotation
The O
howling O
stopped. O
Tom O
pricked O
up O
his O
ears. O
"Sh! Quotation
What's Quotation
that?" Quotation
he Entity
whispered. Cue
"Sounds Quotation
like-- Quotation
like Quotation
hogs Quotation
grunting. Quotation
No-- Quotation
it's Quotation
somebody Quotation
snoring, Quotation
Tom." Quotation
"That Quotation
IS Quotation
it! Quotation
Where Quotation
'bouts Quotation
is Quotation
it, Quotation
Huck?" Quotation
"I Quotation
bleeve Quotation
it's Quotation
down Quotation
at Quotation
'tother Quotation
end. Quotation
Sounds Quotation
so, Quotation
anyway. Quotation
Pap Quotation
used Quotation
to Quotation
sleep Quotation
there, Quotation
sometimes, Quotation
'long Quotation
with Quotation
the Quotation
hogs, Quotation
but Quotation
laws Quotation
bless Quotation
you, Quotation
he Quotation
just Quotation
lifts Quotation
things Quotation
when Quotation
HE Quotation
snores. Quotation
Besides, Quotation
I Quotation
reckon Quotation
he Quotation
ain't Quotation
ever Quotation
coming Quotation
back Quotation
to Quotation
this Quotation
town Quotation
any Quotation
more." Quotation
The O
spirit O
of O
adventure O
rose O
in O
the O
boys' O
souls O
once O
more. O
"Hucky, Quotation
do Quotation
you Quotation
das't Quotation
to Quotation
go Quotation
if Quotation
I Quotation
lead?" Quotation
"I Quotation
don't Quotation
like Quotation
to, Quotation
much. Quotation
Tom, Quotation
s'pose Quotation
it's Quotation
Injun Quotation
Joe!" Quotation
Tom Entity
quailed. O
But O
presently O
the O
temptation O
rose O
up O
strong O
again O
and O
the O
boys O
agreed O
to O
try, O
with O
the O
understanding O
that O
they O
would O
take O
to O
their O
heels O
if O
the O
snoring O
stopped. O
So O
they O
went O
tiptoeing O
stealthily O
down, O
the O
one O
behind O
the O
other. O
When O
they O
had O
got O
to O
within O
five O
steps O
of O
the O
snorer, O
Tom Entity
stepped O
on O
a O
stick, O
and O
it O
broke O
with O
a O
sharp O
snap. O
The O
man O
moaned, O
writhed O
a O
little, O
and O
his O
face O
came O
into O
the O
moonlight. O
It O
was O
Muff O
Potter. O
The O
boys' O
hearts O
had O
stood O
still, O
and O
their O
hopes O
too, O
when O
the O
man O
moved, O
but O
their O
fears O
passed O
away O
now. O
They O
tiptoed O
out, O
through O
the O
broken O
weather-boarding, O
and O
stopped O
at O
a O
little O
distance O
to O
exchange O
a O
parting O
word. O
That O
long, O
lugubrious O
howl O
rose O
on O
the O
night O
air O
again! O
They O
turned O
and O
saw O
the O
strange O
dog O
standing O
within O
a O
few O
feet O
of O
where O
Potter O
was O
lying, O
and O
FACING O
Potter, O
with O
his O
nose O
pointing O
heavenward. O
"Oh, Quotation
geeminy, Quotation
it's Quotation
HIM!" Quotation
exclaimed Cue
both Entity
boys, Entity
in O
a O
breath. O
"Say, Quotation
Tom-- Quotation
they Quotation
say Quotation
a Quotation
stray Quotation
dog Quotation
come Quotation
howling Quotation
around Quotation
Johnny Quotation
Miller's Quotation
house, Quotation
'bout Quotation
midnight, Quotation
as Quotation
much Quotation
as Quotation
two Quotation
weeks Quotation
ago; Quotation
and Quotation
a Quotation
whippoorwill Quotation
come Quotation
in Quotation
and Quotation
lit Quotation
on Quotation
the Quotation
banisters Quotation
and Quotation
sung, Quotation
the Quotation
very Quotation
same Quotation
evening; Quotation
and Quotation
there Quotation
ain't Quotation
anybody Quotation
dead Quotation
there Quotation
yet." Quotation
"Well, Quotation
I Quotation
know Quotation
that. Quotation
And Quotation
suppose Quotation
there Quotation
ain't. Quotation
Didn't Quotation
Gracie Quotation
Miller Quotation
fall Quotation
in Quotation
the Quotation
kitchen Quotation
fire Quotation
and Quotation
burn Quotation
herself Quotation
terrible Quotation
the Quotation
very Quotation
next Quotation
Saturday?" Quotation
"Yes, Quotation
but Quotation
she Quotation
ain't Quotation
DEAD. Quotation
And Quotation
what's Quotation
more, Quotation
she's Quotation
getting Quotation
better, Quotation
too." Quotation
"All Quotation
right, Quotation
you Quotation
wait Quotation
and Quotation
see. Quotation
She's Quotation
a Quotation
goner, Quotation
just Quotation
as Quotation
dead Quotation
sure Quotation
as Quotation
Muff Quotation
Potter's Quotation
a Quotation
goner. Quotation
That's Quotation
what Quotation
the Quotation
niggers Quotation
say, Quotation
and Quotation
they Quotation
know Quotation
all Quotation
about Quotation
these Quotation
kind Quotation
of Quotation
things, Quotation
Huck." Quotation
Then O
they O
separated, O
cogitating. O
When O
Tom O
crept O
in O
at O
his O
bedroom O
window O
the O
night O
was O
almost O
spent. O
He O
undressed O
with O
excessive O
caution, O
and O
fell O
asleep O
congratulating O
himself O
that O
nobody O
knew O
of O
his O
escapade. O
He O
was O
not O
aware O
that O
the O
gently-snoring O
Sid O
was O
awake, O
and O
had O
been O
so O
for O
an O
hour. O
When O
Tom O
awoke, O
Sid O
was O
dressed O
and O
gone. O
There O
was O
a O
late O
look O
in O
the O
light, O
a O
late O
sense O
in O
the O
atmosphere. O
He O
was O
startled. O
Why O
had O
he O
not O
been O
called-- O
persecuted O
till O
he O
was O
up, O
as O
usual? O
The O
thought O
filled O
him O
with O
bodings. O
Within O
five O
minutes O
he O
was O
dressed O
and O
down-stairs, O
feeling O
sore O
and O
drowsy. O
The O
family O
were O
still O
at O
table, O
but O
they O
had O
finished O
breakfast. O
There O
was O
no O
voice O
of O
rebuke; O
but O
there O
were O
averted O
eyes; O
there O
was O
a O
silence O
and O
an O
air O
of O
solemnity O
that O
struck O
a O
chill O
to O
the O
culprit's O
heart. O
He O
sat O
down O
and O
tried O
to O
seem O
gay, O
but O
it O
was O
up-hill O
work; O
it O
roused O
no O
smile, O
no O
response, O
and O
he O
lapsed O
into O
silence O
and O
let O
his O
heart O
sink O
down O
to O
the O
depths. O
After O
breakfast O
his O
aunt O
took O
him O
aside, O
and O
Tom O
almost O
brightened O
in O
the O
hope O
that O
he O
was O
going O
to O
be O
flogged; O
but O
it O
was O
not O
so. O
His Entity
aunt Entity
wept O
over O
him O
and O
asked Cue
him Entity
how Quotation
he Quotation
could Quotation
go Quotation
and Quotation
break Quotation
her Quotation
old Quotation
heart Quotation
so; Quotation
and O
finally O
told Cue
him Entity
to Quotation
go Quotation
on, Quotation
and Quotation
ruin Quotation
himself Quotation
and Quotation
bring Quotation
her Quotation
gray Quotation
hairs Quotation
with Quotation
sorrow Quotation
to Quotation
the Quotation
grave, Quotation
for Quotation
it Quotation
was Quotation
no Quotation
use Quotation
for Quotation
her Quotation
to Quotation
try Quotation
any Quotation
more. Quotation
This O
was O
worse O
than O
a O
thousand O
whippings, O
and O
Tom's O
heart O
was O
sorer O
now O
than O
his O
body. O
He Entity
cried, Cue
he O
pleaded Cue
for Quotation
forgiveness, Quotation
promised Cue
to Quotation
reform Quotation
over O
and O
over O
again, O
and O
then O
received Cue
his Quotation
dismissal, Quotation
feeling O
that O
he O
had O
won O
but O
an O
imperfect O
forgiveness O
and O
established O
but O
a O
feeble O
confidence. O
He O
left O
the O
presence O
too O
miserable O
to O
even O
feel O
revengeful O
toward O
Sid; O
and O
so O
the O
latter's O
prompt O
retreat O
through O
the O
back O
gate O
was O
unnecessary. O
He O
moped O
to O
school O
gloomy O
and O
sad, O
and O
took O
his O
flogging, O
along O
with O
Joe O
Harper, O
for O
playing O
hookey O
the O
day O
before, O
with O
the O
air O
of O
one O
whose O
heart O
was O
busy O
with O
heavier O
woes O
and O
wholly O
dead O
to O
trifles. O
Then O
he O
betook O
himself O
to O
his O
seat, O
rested O
his O
elbows O
on O
his O
desk O
and O
his O
jaws O
in O
his O
hands, O
and O
stared O
at O
the O
wall O
with O
the O
stony O
stare O
of O
suffering O
that O
has O
reached O
the O
limit O
and O
can O
no O
further O
go. O
His O
elbow O
was O
pressing O
against O
some O
hard O
substance. O
After O
a O
long O
time O
he O
slowly O
and O
sadly O
changed O
his O
position, O
and O
took O
up O
this O
object O
with O
a O
sigh. O
It O
was O
in O
a O
paper. O
He O
unrolled O
it. O
A O
long, O
lingering, O
colossal O
sigh O
followed, O
and O
his O
heart O
broke. O
It O
was O
his O
brass O
andiron O
knob! O
This O
final O
feather O
broke O
the O
camel's O
back. O
CHAPTER O
XI O
CLOSE O
upon O
the O
hour O
of O
noon O
the O
whole O
village O
was O
suddenly O
electrified O
with O
the O
ghastly O
news. O
No O
need O
of O
the O
as O
yet O
undreamed-of O
telegraph; O
the O
tale O
flew O
from O
man O
to O
man, O
from O
group O
to O
group, O
from O
house O
to O
house, O
with O
little O
less O
than O
telegraphic O
speed. O
Of O
course O
the O
schoolmaster O
gave O
holiday O
for O
that O
afternoon; O
the O
town O
would O
have O
thought O
strangely O
of O
him O
if O
he O
had O
not. O
A O
gory O
knife O
had O
been O
found O
close O
to O
the O
murdered O
man, O
and O
it O
had O
been O
recognized O
by O
somebody O
as O
belonging O
to O
Muff O
Potter-- O
so O
the O
story O
ran. O
And O
it O
was O
said O
that O
a O
belated O
citizen O
had O
come O
upon O
Potter O
washing O
himself O
in O
the O
"branch" O
about O
one O
or O
two O
o'clock O
in O
the O
morning, O
and O
that O
Potter O
had O
at O
once O
sneaked O
off-- O
suspicious O
circumstances, O
especially O
the O
washing O
which O
was O
not O
a O
habit O
with O
Potter. O
It O
was O
also O
said O
that O
the O
town O
had O
been O
ransacked O
for O
this O
"murderer" O
(the O
public O
are O
not O
slow O
in O
the O
matter O
of O
sifting O
evidence O
and O
arriving O
at O
a O
verdict), O
but O
that O
he O
could O
not O
be O
found. O
Horsemen O
had O
departed O
down O
all O
the O
roads O
in O
every O
direction, O
and O
the O
Sheriff O
"was O
confident" O
that O
he O
would O
be O
captured O
before O
night. O
All O
the O
town O
was O
drifting O
toward O
the O
graveyard. O
Tom's O
heartbreak O
vanished O
and O
he O
joined O
the O
procession, O
not O
because O
he O
would O
not O
a O
thousand O
times O
rather O
go O
anywhere O
else, O
but O
because O
an O
awful, O
unaccountable O
fascination O
drew O
him O
on. O
Arrived O
at O
the O
dreadful O
place, O
he O
wormed O
his O
small O
body O
through O
the O
crowd O
and O
saw O
the O
dismal O
spectacle. O
It O
seemed O
to O
him O
an O
age O
since O
he O
was O
there O
before. O
Somebody O
pinched O
his O
arm. O
He O
turned, O
and O
his O
eyes O
met O
Huckleberry's. O
Then O
both O
looked O
elsewhere O
at O
once, O
and O
wondered O
if O
anybody O
had O
noticed O
anything O
in O
their O
mutual O
glance. O
But O
everybody Entity
was O
talking, Cue
and O
intent O
upon O
the O
grisly O
spectacle O
before O
them. O
"Poor Quotation
fellow!" Quotation
"Poor Quotation
young Quotation
fellow!" Quotation
"This Quotation
ought Quotation
to Quotation
be Quotation
a Quotation
lesson Quotation
to Quotation
grave Quotation
robbers!" Quotation
"Muff Quotation
Potter'll Quotation
hang Quotation
for Quotation
this Quotation
if Quotation
they Quotation
catch Quotation
him!" Quotation
This O
was O
the O
drift O
of O
remark; O
and O
the Entity
minister Entity
said, Cue
"It Quotation
was Quotation
a Quotation
judgment; Quotation
His Quotation
hand Quotation
is Quotation
here." Quotation
Now O
Tom O
shivered O
from O
head O
to O
heel; O
for O
his O
eye O
fell O
upon O
the O
stolid O
face O
of O
Injun O
Joe. O
At O
this O
moment O
the O
crowd O
began O
to O
sway O
and O
struggle, O
and O
voices Entity
shouted, Cue
"It's Quotation
him! Quotation
it's Quotation
him! Quotation
he's Quotation
coming Quotation
himself!" Quotation
"Who? Quotation
Who?" Quotation
from O
twenty Entity
voices. Entity
"Muff Quotation
Potter!" Quotation
"Hallo, Quotation
he's Quotation
stopped!-- Quotation
Look Quotation
out, Quotation
he's Quotation
turning! Quotation
Don't Quotation
let Quotation
him Quotation
get Quotation
away!" Quotation
People Entity
in Entity
the Entity
branches Entity
of Entity
the Entity
trees Entity
over Entity
Tom's Entity
head Entity
said Cue
he Quotation
wasn't Quotation
trying Quotation
to Quotation
get Quotation
away-- Quotation
he Quotation
only Quotation
looked Quotation
doubtful Quotation
and Quotation
perplexed. Quotation
"Infernal Quotation
impudence!" Quotation
said Cue
a Entity
bystander; Entity
"wanted Quotation
to Quotation
come Quotation
and Quotation
take Quotation
a Quotation
quiet Quotation
look Quotation
at Quotation
his Quotation
work, Quotation
I Quotation
reckon-- Quotation
didn't Quotation
expect Quotation
any Quotation
company." Quotation
The O
crowd O
fell O
apart, O
now, O
and O
the O
Sheriff O
came O
through, O
ostentatiously O
leading O
Potter O
by O
the O
arm. O
The O
poor O
fellow's O
face O
was O
haggard, O
and O
his O
eyes O
showed O
the O
fear O
that O
was O
upon O
him. O
When O
he O
stood O
before O
the O
murdered O
man, O
he O
shook O
as O
with O
a O
palsy, O
and O
he O
put O
his O
face O
in O
his O
hands O
and O
burst O
into O
tears. O
"I Quotation
didn't Quotation
do Quotation
it, Quotation
friends," Quotation
he Entity
sobbed; Cue
"'pon Quotation
my Quotation
word Quotation
and Quotation
honor Quotation
I Quotation
never Quotation
done Quotation
it." Quotation
"Who's Quotation
accused Quotation
you?" Quotation
shouted Cue
a Entity
voice. Entity
This O
shot O
seemed O
to O
carry O
home. O
Potter O
lifted O
his O
face O
and O
looked O
around O
him O
with O
a O
pathetic O
hopelessness O
in O
his O
eyes. O
He Entity
saw O
Injun Entity
Joe, Entity
and O
exclaimed: Cue
"Oh, Quotation
Injun Quotation
Joe, Quotation
you Quotation
promised Quotation
me Quotation
you'd Quotation
never Quotation
-- Quotation
" Quotation
"Is Quotation
that Quotation
your Quotation
knife?" Quotation
and O
it O
was O
thrust O
before O
him Entity
by O
the Entity
Sheriff. Entity
Potter O
would O
have O
fallen O
if O
they O
had O
not O
caught O
him O
and O
eased O
him O
to O
the O
ground. O
Then O
he Entity
said: Cue
"Something Quotation
told Quotation
me Quotation
't Quotation
if Quotation
I Quotation
didn't Quotation
come Quotation
back Quotation
and Quotation
get Quotation
-- Quotation
" Quotation
He Entity
shuddered; O
then O
waved O
his O
nerveless O
hand O
with O
a O
vanquished O
gesture O
and O
said, Cue
"Tell Quotation
'em, Quotation
Joe, Quotation
tell Quotation
'em-- Quotation
it Quotation
ain't Quotation
any Quotation
use Quotation
any Quotation
more." Quotation
Then O
Huckleberry O
and O
Tom O
stood O
dumb O
and O
staring, O
and O
heard O
the Entity
stony-hearted Entity
liar Entity
reel O
off O
his O
serene O
statement, O
they O
expecting O
every O
moment O
that O
the O
clear O
sky O
would O
deliver O
God's O
lightnings O
upon O
his O
head, O
and O
wondering O
to O
see O
how O
long O
the O
stroke O
was O
delayed. O
And O
when O
he O
had O
finished O
and O
still O
stood O
alive O
and O
whole, O
their O
wavering O
impulse O
to O
break O
their O
oath O
and O
save O
the O
poor O
betrayed O
prisoner's O
life O
faded O
and O
vanished O
away, O
for O
plainly O
this O
miscreant O
had O
sold O
himself O
to O
Satan O
and O
it O
would O
be O
fatal O
to O
meddle O
with O
the O
property O
of O
such O
a O
power O
as O
that. O
"Why Quotation
didn't Quotation
you Quotation
leave? Quotation
What Quotation
did Quotation
you Quotation
want Quotation
to Quotation
come Quotation
here Quotation
for?" Quotation
somebody Entity
said. Cue
"I Quotation
couldn't Quotation
help Quotation
it Quotation
-- Quotation
I Quotation
couldn't Quotation
help Quotation
it," Quotation
Potter Entity
moaned. Cue
"I Quotation
wanted Quotation
to Quotation
run Quotation
away, Quotation
but Quotation
I Quotation
couldn't Quotation
seem Quotation
to Quotation
come Quotation
anywhere Quotation
but Quotation
here." Quotation
And O
he O
fell O
to O
sobbing O
again. O
Injun Entity
Joe Entity
repeated Cue
his Quotation
statement, Quotation
just O
as O
calmly, O
a O
few O
minutes O
afterward O
on O
the O
inquest, O
under O
oath; O
and O
the O
boys, O
seeing O
that O
the O
lightnings O
were O
still O
withheld, O
were O
confirmed O
in O
their O
belief O
that O
Joe O
had O
sold O
himself O
to O
the O
devil. O
He O
was O
now O
become, O
to O
them, O
the O
most O
balefully O
interesting O
object O
they O
had O
ever O
looked O
upon, O
and O
they O
could O
not O
take O
their O
fascinated O
eyes O
from O
his O
face. O
They O
inwardly O
resolved O
to O
watch O
him O
nights, O
when O
opportunity O
should O
offer, O
in O
the O
hope O
of O
getting O
a O
glimpse O
of O
his O
dread O
master. O
Injun O
Joe O
helped O
to O
raise O
the O
body O
of O
the O
murdered O
man O
and O
put O
it O
in O
a O
wagon O
for O
removal; O
and O
it O
was O
whispered O
through O
the O
shuddering O
crowd O
that O
the O
wound O
bled O
a O
little! O
The O
boys O
thought O
that O
this O
happy O
circumstance O
would O
turn O
suspicion O
in O
the O
right O
direction; O
but O
they O
were O
disappointed, O
for O
more Entity
than Entity
one Entity
villager Entity
remarked: Cue
"It Quotation
was Quotation
within Quotation
three Quotation
feet Quotation
of Quotation
Muff Quotation
Potter Quotation
when Quotation
it Quotation
done Quotation
it." Quotation
Tom's O
fearful O
secret O
and O
gnawing O
conscience O
disturbed O
his O
sleep O
for O
as O
much O
as O
a O
week O
after O
this; O
and O
at O
breakfast O
one O
morning O
Sid Entity
said: Cue
"Tom, Quotation
you Quotation
pitch Quotation
around Quotation
and Quotation
talk Quotation
in Quotation
your Quotation
sleep Quotation
so Quotation
much Quotation
that Quotation
you Quotation
keep Quotation
me Quotation
awake Quotation
half Quotation
the Quotation
time." Quotation
Tom Entity
blanched O
and O
dropped O
his O
eyes. O
"It's Quotation
a Quotation
bad Quotation
sign," Quotation
said Cue
Aunt Entity
Polly, Entity
gravely. O
"What Quotation
you Quotation
got Quotation
on Quotation
your Quotation
mind, Quotation
Tom?" Quotation
"Nothing. Quotation
Nothing Quotation
't Quotation
I Quotation
know Quotation
of." Quotation
But O
the Entity
boy's Entity
hand O
shook O
so O
that O
he O
spilled O
his O
coffee. O
"And Quotation
you Quotation
do Quotation
talk Quotation
such Quotation
stuff," Quotation
Sid Entity
said. Cue
"Last Quotation
night Quotation
you Quotation
said, Quotation
'It's Quotation
blood, Quotation
it's Quotation
blood, Quotation
that's Quotation
what Quotation
it Quotation
is!' Quotation
You Quotation
said Quotation
that Quotation
over Quotation
and Quotation
over. Quotation
And Quotation
you Quotation
said, Quotation
'Don't Quotation
torment Quotation
me Quotation
so-- Quotation
I'll Quotation
tell!' Quotation
Tell Quotation
WHAT? Quotation
What Quotation
is Quotation
it Quotation
you'll Quotation
tell?" Quotation
Everything O
was O
swimming O
before O
Tom. O
There O
is O
no O
telling O
what O
might O
have O
happened, O
now, O
but O
luckily O
the O
concern O
passed O
out O
of O
Aunt O
Polly's O
face O
and O
she O
came O
to O
Tom's Entity
relief O
without O
knowing O
it. O
She Entity
said: Cue
"Sho! Quotation
It's Quotation
that Quotation
dreadful Quotation
murder. Quotation
I Quotation
dream Quotation
about Quotation
it Quotation
most Quotation
every Quotation
night Quotation
myself. Quotation
Sometimes Quotation
I Quotation
dream Quotation
it's Quotation
me Quotation
that Quotation
done Quotation
it." Quotation
Mary Entity
said Cue
she Quotation
had Quotation
been Quotation
affected Quotation
much Quotation
the Quotation
same Quotation
way. Quotation
Sid O
seemed O
satisfied. O
Tom O
got O
out O
of O
the O
presence O
as O
quick O
as O
he O
plausibly O
could, O
and O
after O
that O
he O
complained O
of O
toothache O
for O
a O
week, O
and O
tied O
up O
his O
jaws O
every O
night. O
He O
never O
knew O
that O
Sid O
lay O
nightly O
watching, O
and O
frequently O
slipped O
the O
bandage O
free O
and O
then O
leaned O
on O
his O
elbow O
listening O
a O
good O
while O
at O
a O
time, O
and O
afterward O
slipped O
the O
bandage O
back O
to O
its O
place O
again. O
Tom's O
distress O
of O
mind O
wore O
off O
gradually O
and O
the O
toothache O
grew O
irksome O
and O
was O
discarded. O
If O
Sid O
really O
managed O
to O
make O
anything O
out O
of O
Tom's O
disjointed O
mutterings, O
he O
kept O
it O
to O
himself. O
It O
seemed O
to O
Tom O
that O
his O
schoolmates O
never O
would O
get O
done O
holding O
inquests O
on O
dead O
cats, O
and O
thus O
keeping O
his O
trouble O
present O
to O
his O
mind. O
Sid O
noticed O
that O
Tom O
never O
was O
coroner O
at O
one O
of O
these O
inquiries, O
though O
it O
had O
been O
his O
habit O
to O
take O
the O
lead O
in O
all O
new O
enterprises; O
he O
noticed, O
too, O
that O
Tom O
never O
acted O
as O
a O
witness-- O
and O
that O
was O
strange; O
and O
Sid O
did O
not O
overlook O
the O
fact O
that O
Tom O
even O
showed O
a O
marked O
aversion O
to O
these O
inquests, O
and O
always O
avoided O
them O
when O
he O
could. O
Sid O
marvelled, O
but O
said O
nothing. O
However, O
even O
inquests O
went O
out O
of O
vogue O
at O
last, O
and O
ceased O
to O
torture O
Tom's O
conscience. O
Every O
day O
or O
two, O
during O
this O
time O
of O
sorrow, O
Tom O
watched O
his O
opportunity O
and O
went O
to O
the O
little O
grated O
jail-window O
and O
smuggled O
such O
small O
comforts O
through O
to O
the O
"murderer" O
as O
he O
could O
get O
hold O
of. O
The O
jail O
was O
a O
trifling O
little O
brick O
den O
that O
stood O
in O
a O
marsh O
at O
the O
edge O
of O
the O
village, O
and O
no O
guards O
were O
afforded O
for O
it; O
indeed, O
it O
was O
seldom O
occupied. O
These O
offerings O
greatly O
helped O
to O
ease O
Tom's O
conscience. O
The O
villagers O
had O
a O
strong O
desire O
to O
tar-and-feather O
Injun O
Joe O
and O
ride O
him O
on O
a O
rail, O
for O
body-snatching, O
but O
so O
formidable O
was O
his O
character O
that O
nobody O
could O
be O
found O
who O
was O
willing O
to O
take O
the O
lead O
in O
the O
matter, O
so O
it O
was O
dropped. O
He O
had O
been O
careful O
to O
begin O
both O
of O
his O
inquest-statements O
with O
the O
fight, O
without O
confessing O
the O
grave-robbery O
that O
preceded O
it; O
therefore O
it O
was O
deemed O
wisest O
not O
to O
try O
the O
case O
in O
the O
courts O
at O
present. O
CHAPTER O
XII O
ONE O
of O
the O
reasons O
why O
Tom's O
mind O
had O
drifted O
away O
from O
its O
secret O
troubles O
was, O
that O
it O
had O
found O
a O
new O
and O
weighty O
matter O
to O
interest O
itself O
about. O
Becky O
Thatcher O
had O
stopped O
coming O
to O
school. O
Tom O
had O
struggled O
with O
his O
pride O
a O
few O
days, O
and O
tried O
to O
"whistle O
her O
down O
the O
wind," O
but O
failed. O
He O
began O
to O
find O
himself O
hanging O
around O
her O
father's O
house, O
nights, O
and O
feeling O
very O
miserable. O
She O
was O
ill. O
What O
if O
she O
should O
die! O
There O
was O
distraction O
in O
the O
thought. O
He O
no O
longer O
took O
an O
interest O
in O
war, O
nor O
even O
in O
piracy. O
The O
charm O
of O
life O
was O
gone; O
there O
was O
nothing O
but O
dreariness O
left. O
He O
put O
his O
hoop O
away, O
and O
his O
bat; O
there O
was O
no O
joy O
in O
them O
any O
more. O
His O
aunt O
was O
concerned. O
She O
began O
to O
try O
all O
manner O
of O
remedies O
on O
him. O
She O
was O
one O
of O
those O
people O
who O
are O
infatuated O
with O
patent O
medicines O
and O
all O
new-fangled O
methods O
of O
producing O
health O
or O
mending O
it. O
She O
was O
an O
inveterate O
experimenter O
in O
these O
things. O
When O
something O
fresh O
in O
this O
line O
came O
out O
she O
was O
in O
a O
fever, O
right O
away, O
to O
try O
it; O
not O
on O
herself, O
for O
she O
was O
never O
ailing, O
but O
on O
anybody O
else O
that O
came O
handy. O
She O
was O
a O
subscriber O
for O
all O
the O
"Health" O
periodicals O
and O
phrenological O
frauds; O
and O
the O
solemn O
ignorance O
they O
were O
inflated O
with O
was O
breath O
to O
her O
nostrils. O
All O
the O
"rot" O
they O
contained O
about O
ventilation, O
and O
how O
to O
go O
to O
bed, O
and O
how O
to O
get O
up, O
and O
what O
to O
eat, O
and O
what O
to O
drink, O
and O
how O
much O
exercise O
to O
take, O
and O
what O
frame O
of O
mind O
to O
keep O
one's O
self O
in, O
and O
what O
sort O
of O
clothing O
to O
wear, O
was O
all O
gospel O
to O
her, O
and O
she O
never O
observed O
that O
her O
health-journals O
of O
the O
current O
month O
customarily O
upset O
everything O
they O
had O
recommended O
the O
month O
before. O
She O
was O
as O
simple-hearted O
and O
honest O
as O
the O
day O
was O
long, O
and O
so O
she O
was O
an O
easy O
victim. O
She O
gathered O
together O
her O
quack O
periodicals O
and O
her O
quack O
medicines, O
and O
thus O
armed O
with O
death, O
went O
about O
on O
her O
pale O
horse, O
metaphorically O
speaking, O
with O
"hell O
following O
after." O
But O
she O
never O
suspected O
that O
she O
was O
not O
an O
angel O
of O
healing O
and O
the O
balm O
of O
Gilead O
in O
disguise, O
to O
the O
suffering O
neighbors. O
The O
water O
treatment O
was O
new, O
now, O
and O
Tom's O
low O
condition O
was O
a O
windfall O
to O
her. O
She O
had O
him O
out O
at O
daylight O
every O
morning, O
stood O
him O
up O
in O
the O
woodshed O
and O
drowned O
him O
with O
a O
deluge O
of O
cold O
water; O
then O
she O
scrubbed O
him O
down O
with O
a O
towel O
like O
a O
file, O
and O
so O
brought O
him O
to; O
then O
she O
rolled O
him O
up O
in O
a O
wet O
sheet O
and O
put O
him O
away O
under O
blankets O
till O
she Entity
sweated O
his O
soul O
clean O
and O
"the Quotation
yellow Quotation
stains Quotation
of Quotation
it Quotation
came Quotation
through Quotation
his Quotation
pores"-- Quotation
as O
Tom Entity
said. Cue
Yet O
notwithstanding O
all O
this, O
the O
boy O
grew O
more O
and O
more O
melancholy O
and O
pale O
and O
dejected. O
She O
added O
hot O
baths, O
sitz O
baths, O
shower O
baths, O
and O
plunges. O
The O
boy O
remained O
as O
dismal O
as O
a O
hearse. O
She O
began O
to O
assist O
the O
water O
with O
a O
slim O
oatmeal O
diet O
and O
blister-plasters. O
She O
calculated O
his O
capacity O
as O
she O
would O
a O
jug's, O
and O
filled O
him O
up O
every O
day O
with O
quack O
cure-alls. O
Tom O
had O
become O
indifferent O
to O
persecution O
by O
this O
time. O
This O
phase O
filled O
the O
old O
lady's O
heart O
with O
consternation. O
This O
indifference O
must O
be O
broken O
up O
at O
any O
cost. O
Now O
she O
heard O
of O
Pain-killer O
for O
the O
first O
time. O
She O
ordered O
a O
lot O
at O
once. O
She O
tasted O
it O
and O
was O
filled O
with O
gratitude. O
It O
was O
simply O
fire O
in O
a O
liquid O
form. O
She O
dropped O
the O
water O
treatment O
and O
everything O
else, O
and O
pinned O
her O
faith O
to O
Pain-killer. O
She O
gave O
Tom O
a O
teaspoonful O
and O
watched O
with O
the O
deepest O
anxiety O
for O
the O
result. O
Her O
troubles O
were O
instantly O
at O
rest, O
her O
soul O
at O
peace O
again; O
for O
the O
"indifference" O
was O
broken O
up. O
The O
boy O
could O
not O
have O
shown O
a O
wilder, O
heartier O
interest, O
if O
she O
had O
built O
a O
fire O
under O
him. O
Tom O
felt O
that O
it O
was O
time O
to O
wake O
up; O
this O
sort O
of O
life O
might O
be O
romantic O
enough, O
in O
his O
blighted O
condition, O
but O
it O
was O
getting O
to O
have O
too O
little O
sentiment O
and O
too O
much O
distracting O
variety O
about O
it. O
So O
he O
thought O
over O
various O
plans O
for O
relief, O
and O
finally O
hit O
pon O
that O
of O
professing O
to O
be O
fond O
of O
Pain-killer. O
He O
asked O
for O
it O
so O
often O
that O
he O
became O
a O
nuisance, O
and O
his O
aunt O
ended O
by O
telling O
him O
to O
help O
himself O
and O
quit O
bothering O
her. O
If O
it O
had O
been O
Sid, O
she O
would O
have O
had O
no O
misgivings O
to O
alloy O
her O
delight; O
but O
since O
it O
was O
Tom, O
she O
watched O
the O
bottle O
clandestinely. O
She O
found O
that O
the O
medicine O
did O
really O
diminish, O
but O
it O
did O
not O
occur O
to O
her O
that O
the O
boy O
was O
mending O
the O
health O
of O
a O
crack O
in O
the O
sitting-room O
floor O
with O
it. O
One O
day O
Tom O
was O
in O
the O
act O
of O
dosing O
the O
crack O
when O
his O
aunt's O
yellow O
cat O
came O
along, O
purring, O
eying O
the O
teaspoon O
avariciously, O
and O
begging O
for O
a O
taste. O
Tom Entity
said: Cue
"Don't Quotation
ask Quotation
for Quotation
it Quotation
unless Quotation
you Quotation
want Quotation
it, Quotation
Peter." Quotation
But O
Peter Entity
signified O
that O
he O
did O
want O
it. O
"You Quotation
better Quotation
make Quotation
sure." Quotation
Peter Entity
was O
sure. O
"Now Quotation
you've Quotation
asked Quotation
for Quotation
it, Quotation
and Quotation
I'll Quotation
give Quotation
it Quotation
to Quotation
you, Quotation
because Quotation
there Quotation
ain't Quotation
anything Quotation
mean Quotation
about Quotation
me; Quotation
but Quotation
if Quotation
you Quotation
find Quotation
you Quotation
don't Quotation
like Quotation
it, Quotation
you Quotation
mustn't Quotation
blame Quotation
anybody Quotation
but Quotation
your Quotation
own Quotation
self." Quotation
Peter O
was O
agreeable. O
So O
Tom O
pried O
his O
mouth O
open O
and O
poured O
down O
the O
Pain-killer. O
Peter O
sprang O
a O
couple O
of O
yards O
in O
the O
air, O
and O
then O
delivered O
a O
war-whoop O
and O
set O
off O
round O
and O
round O
the O
room, O
banging O
against O
furniture, O
upsetting O
flower-pots, O
and O
making O
general O
havoc. O
Next O
he O
rose O
on O
his O
hind O
feet O
and O
pranced O
around, O
in O
a O
frenzy O
of O
enjoyment, O
with O
his O
head O
over O
his O
shoulder O
and O
his O
voice O
proclaiming O
his O
unappeasable O
happiness. O
Then O
he O
went O
tearing O
around O
the O
house O
again O
spreading O
chaos O
and O
destruction O
in O
his O
path. O
Aunt O
Polly O
entered O
in O
time O
to O
see O
him O
throw O
a O
few O
double O
summersets, O
deliver O
a O
final O
mighty O
hurrah, O
and O
sail O
through O
the O
open O
window, O
carrying O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
flower-pots O
with O
him. O
The Entity
old Entity
lady Entity
stood O
petrified O
with O
astonishment, O
peering O
over O
her O
glasses; O
Tom Entity
lay O
on O
the O
floor O
expiring O
with O
laughter. O
"Tom, Quotation
what Quotation
on Quotation
earth Quotation
ails Quotation
that Quotation
cat?" Quotation
"I Quotation
don't Quotation
know, Quotation
aunt," Quotation
gasped Cue
the Entity
boy. Entity
"Why, Quotation
I Quotation
never Quotation
see Quotation
anything Quotation
like Quotation
it. Quotation
What Quotation
did Quotation
make Quotation
him Quotation
act Quotation
so?" Quotation
"Deed Quotation
I Quotation
don't Quotation
know, Quotation
Aunt Quotation
Polly; Quotation
cats Quotation
always Quotation
act Quotation
so Quotation
when Quotation
they're Quotation
having Quotation
a Quotation
good Quotation
time." Quotation
"They Quotation
do, Quotation
do Quotation
they?" Quotation
There O
was O
something O
in O
the O
tone O
that O
made O
Tom Entity
apprehensive. O
"Yes'm. Quotation
That Quotation
is, Quotation
I Quotation
believe Quotation
they Quotation
do." Quotation
"You Quotation
DO?" Quotation
"Yes'm." Quotation
The O
old O
lady O
was O
bending O
down, O
Tom O
watching, O
with O
interest O
emphasized O
by O
anxiety. O
Too O
late O
he O
divined O
her O
"drift." O
The O
handle O
of O
the O
telltale O
teaspoon O
was O
visible O
under O
the O
bed-valance. O
Aunt O
Polly O
took O
it, O
held O
it O
up. O
Tom O
winced, O
and O
dropped O
his O
eyes. O
Aunt Entity
Polly Entity
raised O
him Entity
by O
the O
usual O
handle-- O
his O
ear-- O
and O
cracked O
his O
head O
soundly O
with O
her O
thimble. O
"Now, Quotation
sir, Quotation
what Quotation
did Quotation
you Quotation
want Quotation
to Quotation
treat Quotation
that Quotation
poor Quotation
dumb Quotation
beast Quotation
so, Quotation
for?" Quotation
"I Quotation
done Quotation
it Quotation
out Quotation
of Quotation
pity Quotation
for Quotation
him-- Quotation
because Quotation
he Quotation
hadn't Quotation
any Quotation
aunt." Quotation
"Hadn't Quotation
any Quotation
aunt!-- Quotation
you Quotation
numskull. Quotation
What Quotation
has Quotation
that Quotation
got Quotation
to Quotation
do Quotation
with Quotation
it?" Quotation
"Heaps. Quotation
Because Quotation
if Quotation
he'd Quotation
had Quotation
one Quotation
she'd Quotation
a Quotation
burnt Quotation
him Quotation
out Quotation
herself! Quotation
She'd Quotation
a Quotation
roasted Quotation
his Quotation
bowels Quotation
out Quotation
of Quotation
him Quotation
'thout Quotation
any Quotation
more Quotation
feeling Quotation
than Quotation
if Quotation
he Quotation
was Quotation
a Quotation
human!" Quotation
Aunt O
Polly O
felt O
a O
sudden O
pang O
of O
remorse. O
This O
was O
putting O
the O
thing O
in O
a O
new O
light; O
what O
was O
cruelty O
to O
a O
cat O
MIGHT O
be O
cruelty O
to O
a O
boy, O
too. O
She O
began O
to O
soften; O
she O
felt O
sorry. O
Her O
eyes O
watered O
a O
little, O
and O
she Entity
put O
her O
hand O
on O
Tom's Entity
head O
and O
said Cue
gently: O
"I Quotation
was Quotation
meaning Quotation
for Quotation
the Quotation
best, Quotation
Tom. Quotation
And, Quotation
Tom, Quotation
it Quotation
DID Quotation
do Quotation
you Quotation
good." Quotation
Tom Entity
looked O
up O
in O
her Entity
face O
with O
just O
a O
perceptible O
twinkle O
peeping O
through O
his O
gravity. O
"I Quotation
know Quotation
you Quotation
was Quotation
meaning Quotation
for Quotation
the Quotation
best, Quotation
aunty, Quotation
and Quotation
so Quotation
was Quotation
I Quotation
with Quotation
Peter. Quotation
It Quotation
done Quotation
HIM Quotation
good, Quotation
too. Quotation
I Quotation
never Quotation
see Quotation
him Quotation
get Quotation
around Quotation
so Quotation
since Quotation
-- Quotation
" Quotation
"Oh, Quotation
go Quotation
'long Quotation
with Quotation
you, Quotation
Tom, Quotation
before Quotation
you Quotation
aggravate Quotation
me Quotation
again. Quotation
And Quotation
you Quotation
try Quotation
and Quotation
see Quotation
if Quotation
you Quotation
can't Quotation
be Quotation
a Quotation
good Quotation
boy, Quotation
for Quotation
once, Quotation
and Quotation
you Quotation
needn't Quotation
take Quotation
any Quotation
more Quotation
medicine." Quotation
Tom O
reached O
school O
ahead O
of O
time. O
It O
was O
noticed O
that O
this O
strange O
thing O
had O
been O
occurring O
every O
day O
latterly. O
And O
now, O
as O
usual O
of O
late, O
he O
hung O
about O
the O
gate O
of O
the O
schoolyard O
instead O
of O
playing O
with O
his O
comrades. O
He O
was O
sick, O
he O
said, O
and O
he O
looked O
it. O
He O
tried O
to O
seem O
to O
be O
looking O
everywhere O
but O
whither O
he O
really O
was O
looking-- O
down O
the O
road. O
Presently O
Jeff O
Thatcher O
hove O
in O
sight, O
and O
Tom's O
face O
lighted; O
he O
gazed O
a O
moment, O
and O
then O
turned O
sorrowfully O
away. O
When O
Jeff O
arrived, O
Tom O
accosted O
him; O
and O
"led O
up" O
warily O
to O
opportunities O
for O
remark O
about O
Becky, O
but O
the O
giddy O
lad O
never O
could O
see O
the O
bait. O
Tom O
watched O
and O
watched, O
hoping O
whenever O
a O
frisking O
frock O
came O
in O
sight, O
and O
hating O
the O
owner O
of O
it O
as O
soon O
as O
he O
saw O
she O
was O
not O
the O
right O
one. O
At O
last O
frocks O
ceased O
to O
appear, O
and O
he O
dropped O
hopelessly O
into O
the O
dumps; O
he O
entered O
the O
empty O
schoolhouse O
and O
sat O
down O
to O
suffer. O
Then O
one O
more O
frock O
passed O
in O
at O
the O
gate, O
and O
Tom's O
heart O
gave O
a O
great O
bound. O
The O
next O
instant O
he O
was O
out, O
and O
"going O
on" O
like O
an O
Indian; O
yelling, O
laughing, O
chasing O
boys, O
jumping O
over O
the O
fence O
at O
risk O
of O
life O
and O
limb, O
throwing O
handsprings, O
standing O
on O
his O
head-- O
doing O
all O
the O
heroic O
things O
he O
could O
conceive O
of, O
and O
keeping O
a O
furtive O
eye O
out, O
all O
the O
while, O
to O
see O
if O
Becky O
Thatcher O
was O
noticing. O
But O
she O
seemed O
to O
be O
unconscious O
of O
it O
all; O
she O
never O
looked. O
Could O
it O
be O
possible O
that O
she O
was O
not O
aware O
that O
he O
was O
there? O
He O
carried O
his O
exploits O
to O
her O
immediate O
vicinity; O
came O
war-whooping O
around, O
snatched O
a O
boy's O
cap, O
hurled O
it O
to O
the O
roof O
of O
the O
schoolhouse, O
broke O
through O
a O
group O
of O
boys, O
tumbling O
them O
in O
every O
direction, O
and O
fell O
sprawling, O
himself, O
under O
Becky's O
nose, O
almost O
upsetting O
her-- O
and O
she O
turned, O
with O
her O
nose O
in O
the O
air, O
and O
he O
heard O
her Entity
say: Cue
"Mf! Quotation
some Quotation
people Quotation
think Quotation
they're Quotation
mighty Quotation
smart-- Quotation
always Quotation
showing Quotation
off!" Quotation
Tom's O
cheeks O
burned. O
He O
gathered O
himself O
up O
and O
sneaked O
off, O
crushed O
and O
crestfallen. O
CHAPTER O
XIII O
TOM'S O
mind O
was O
made O
up O
now. O
He O
was O
gloomy O
and O
desperate. O
He O
was O
a O
forsaken, O
friendless O
boy, O
he O
said; O
nobody O
loved O
him; O
when O
they O
found O
out O
what O
they O
had O
driven O
him O
to, O
perhaps O
they O
would O
be O
sorry; O
he O
had O
tried O
to O
do O
right O
and O
get O
along, O
but O
they O
would O
not O
let O
him; O
since O
nothing O
would O
do O
them O
but O
to O
be O
rid O
of O
him, O
let O
it O
be O
so; O
and O
let O
them O
blame O
HIM O
for O
the O
consequences-- O
why O
shouldn't O
they? O
What O
right O
had O
the O
friendless O
to O
complain? O
Yes, O
they O
had O
forced O
him O
to O
it O
at O
last: O
he O
would O
lead O
a O
life O
of O
crime. O
There O
was O
no O
choice. O
By O
this O
time O
he O
was O
far O
down O
Meadow O
Lane, O
and O
the O
bell O
for O
school O
to O
"take O
up" O
tinkled O
faintly O
upon O
his O
ear. O
He O
sobbed, O
now, O
to O
think O
he O
should O
never, O
never O
hear O
that O
old O
familiar O
sound O
any O
more-- O
it O
was O
very O
hard, O
but O
it O
was O
forced O
on O
him; O
since O
he O
was O
driven O
out O
into O
the O
cold O
world, O
he O
must O
submit-- O
but O
he O
forgave O
them. O
Then O
the O
sobs O
came O
thick O
and O
fast. O
Just O
at O
this O
point O
he O
met O
his O
soul's O
sworn O
comrade, O
Joe O
Harper O
--hard-eyed, O
and O
with O
evidently O
a O
great O
and O
dismal O
purpose O
in O
his O
heart. O
Plainly O
here O
were O
"two O
souls O
with O
but O
a O
single O
thought." O
Tom, O
wiping O
his O
eyes O
with O
his O
sleeve, O
began O
to O
blubber O
out O
something O
about O
a O
resolution O
to O
escape O
from O
hard O
usage O
and O
lack O
of O
sympathy O
at O
home O
by O
roaming O
abroad O
into O
the O
great O
world O
never O
to O
return; O
and O
ended O
by O
hoping O
that O
Joe O
would O
not O
forget O
him. O
But O
it O
transpired O
that O
this O
was O
a O
request O
which O
Joe O
had O
just O
been O
going O
to O
make O
of O
Tom, O
and O
had O
come O
to O
hunt O
him O
up O
for O
that O
purpose. O
His O
mother O
had O
whipped O
him O
for O
drinking O
some O
cream O
which O
he O
had O
never O
tasted O
and O
knew O
nothing O
about; O
it O
was O
plain O
that O
she O
was O
tired O
of O
him O
and O
wished O
him O
to O
go; O
if O
she O
felt O
that O
way, O
there O
was O
nothing O
for O
him O
to O
do O
but O
succumb; O
he O
hoped O
she O
would O
be O
happy, O
and O
never O
regret O
having O
driven O
her O
poor O
boy O
out O
into O
the O
unfeeling O
world O
to O
suffer O
and O
die. O
As O
the O
two O
boys O
walked O
sorrowing O
along, O
they O
made O
a O
new O
compact O
to O
stand O
by O
each O
other O
and O
be O
brothers O
and O
never O
separate O
till O
death O
relieved O
them O
of O
their O
troubles. O
Then O
they O
began O
to O
lay O
their O
plans. O
Joe O
was O
for O
being O
a O
hermit, O
and O
living O
on O
crusts O
in O
a O
remote O
cave, O
and O
dying, O
some O
time, O
of O
cold O
and O
want O
and O
grief; O
but O
after O
listening O
to O
Tom, O
he O
conceded O
that O
there O
were O
some O
conspicuous O
advantages O
about O
a O
life O
of O
crime, O
and O
so O
he O
consented O
to O
be O
a O
pirate. O
Three O
miles O
below O
St. O
Petersburg, O
at O
a O
point O
where O
the O
Mississippi O
River O
was O
a O
trifle O
over O
a O
mile O
wide, O
there O
was O
a O
long, O
narrow, O
wooded O
island, O
with O
a O
shallow O
bar O
at O
the O
head O
of O
it, O
and O
this O
offered O
well O
as O
a O
rendezvous. O
It O
was O
not O
inhabited; O
it O
lay O
far O
over O
toward O
the O
further O
shore, O
abreast O
a O
dense O
and O
almost O
wholly O
unpeopled O
forest. O
So O
Jackson's O
Island O
was O
chosen. O
Who O
were O
to O
be O
the O
subjects O
of O
their O
piracies O
was O
a O
matter O
that O
did O
not O
occur O
to O
them. O
Then O
they O
hunted O
up O
Huckleberry O
Finn, O
and O
he O
joined O
them O
promptly, O
for O
all O
careers O
were O
one O
to O
him; O
he O
was O
indifferent. O
They O
presently O
separated O
to O
meet O
at O
a O
lonely O
spot O
on O
the O
river-bank O
two O
miles O
above O
the O
village O
at O
the O
favorite O
hour-- O
which O
was O
midnight. O
There O
was O
a O
small O
log O
raft O
there O
which O
they O
meant O
to O
capture. O
Each O
would O
bring O
hooks O
and O
lines, O
and O
such O
provision O
as O
he O
could O
steal O
in O
the O
most O
dark O
and O
mysterious O
way-- O
as O
became O
outlaws. O
And O
before O
the O
afternoon O
was O
done, O
they O
had O
all O
managed O
to O
enjoy O
the O
sweet O
glory O
of O
spreading O
the O
fact O
that O
pretty O
soon O
the O
town O
would O
"hear O
something." O
All Entity
who Entity
got Entity
this Entity
vague Entity
hint Entity
were O
cautioned Cue
to O
"be Quotation
mum Quotation
and Quotation
wait." Quotation
About O
midnight O
Tom O
arrived O
with O
a O
boiled O
ham O
and O
a O
few O
trifles, O
and O
stopped O
in O
a O
dense O
undergrowth O
on O
a O
small O
bluff O
overlooking O
the O
meeting-place. O
It O
was O
starlight, O
and O
very O
still. O
The O
mighty O
river O
lay O
like O
an O
ocean O
at O
rest. O
Tom O
listened O
a O
moment, O
but O
no O
sound O
disturbed O
the O
quiet. O
Then O
he O
gave O
a O
low, O
distinct O
whistle. O
It O
was O
answered O
from O
under O
the O
bluff. O
Tom Entity
whistled O
twice O
more; O
these O
signals O
were O
answered O
in O
the O
same O
way. O
Then O
a Entity
guarded Entity
voice Entity
said: Cue
"Who Quotation
goes Quotation
there?" Quotation
"Tom Quotation
Sawyer, Quotation
the Quotation
Black Quotation
Avenger Quotation
of Quotation
the Quotation
Spanish Quotation
Main. Quotation
Name Quotation
your Quotation
names." Quotation
"Huck Quotation
Finn Quotation
the Quotation
Red-Handed, Quotation
and Quotation
Joe Quotation
Harper Quotation
the Quotation
Terror Quotation
of Quotation
the Quotation
Seas." Quotation
Tom Entity
had O
furnished O
these O
titles, O
from O
his O
favorite O
literature. O
"'Tis Quotation
well. Quotation
Give Quotation
the Quotation
countersign." Quotation
Two Entity
hoarse Entity
whispers Entity
delivered Cue
the O
same O
awful O
word O
simultaneously O
to O
the O
brooding O
night: O
"BLOOD!" Quotation
Then O
Tom O
tumbled O
his O
ham O
over O
the O
bluff O
and O
let O
himself O
down O
after O
it, O
tearing O
both O
skin O
and O
clothes O
to O
some O
extent O
in O
the O
effort. O
There O
was O
an O
easy, O
comfortable O
path O
along O
the O
shore O
under O
the O
bluff, O
but O
it O
lacked O
the O
advantages O
of O
difficulty O
and O
danger O
so O
valued O
by O
a O
pirate. O
The O
Terror O
of O
the O
Seas O
had O
brought O
a O
side O
of O
bacon, O
and O
had O
about O
worn O
himself O
out O
with O
getting O
it O
there. O
Finn O
the O
Red-Handed O
had O
stolen O
a O
skillet O
and O
a O
quantity O
of O
half-cured O
leaf O
tobacco, O
and O
had O
also O
brought O
a O
few O
corn-cobs O
to O
make O
pipes O
with. O
But O
none O
of O
the O
pirates O
smoked O
or O
"chewed" O
but O
himself. O
The O
Black O
Avenger O
of O
the O
Spanish O
Main O
said O
it O
would O
never O
do O
to O
start O
without O
some O
fire. O
That O
was O
a O
wise O
thought; O
matches O
were O
hardly O
known O
there O
in O
that O
day. O
They O
saw O
a O
fire O
smouldering O
upon O
a O
great O
raft O
a O
hundred O
yards O
above, O
and O
they O
went O
stealthily O
thither O
and O
helped O
themselves O
to O
a O
chunk. O
They Entity
made O
an O
imposing O
adventure O
of O
it, O
saying, Cue
"Hist!" Quotation
every O
now O
and O
then, O
and O
suddenly O
halting O
with O
finger O
on O
lip; O
moving O
with O
hands O
on O
imaginary O
dagger-hilts; O
and O
giving Cue
orders Cue
in O
dismal O
whispers O
that O
if O
"the O
foe" O
stirred, O
to O
"let Quotation
him Quotation
have Quotation
it Quotation
to Quotation
the Quotation
hilt," Quotation
because O
"dead Quotation
men Quotation
tell Quotation
no Quotation
tales." Quotation
They O
knew O
well O
enough O
that O
the O
raftsmen O
were O
all O
down O
at O
the O
village O
laying O
in O
stores O
or O
having O
a O
spree, O
but O
still O
that O
was O
no O
excuse O
for O
their O
conducting O
this O
thing O
in O
an O
unpiratical O
way. O
They O
shoved O
off, O
presently, O
Tom O
in O
command, O
Huck Entity
at O
the O
after O
oar O
and O
Joe O
at O
the O
forward. O
Tom Entity
stood O
amidships, O
gloomy-browed, O
and O
with O
folded O
arms, O
and O
gave Cue
his Cue
orders Cue
in O
a O
low, O
stern O
whisper: O
"Luff, Quotation
and Quotation
bring Quotation
her Quotation
to Quotation
the Quotation
wind!" Quotation
"Aye-aye, Quotation
sir!" Quotation
"Steady, Quotation
steady-y-y-y!" Quotation
"Steady Quotation
it Quotation
is, Quotation
sir!" Quotation
"Let Quotation

"Point Quotation
it Quotation
is, Quotation
sir!" Quotation
As O
the O
boys O
steadily O
and O
monotonously O
drove O
the O
raft O
toward O
mid-stream O
it O
was O
no O
doubt O
understood O
that O
these O
orders O
were O
given O
only O
for O
"style," O
and O
were O
not O
intended O
to O
mean O
anything O
in O
particular. O
"What Quotation

"Courses, Quotation

and Quotation

sir." Quotation
"Send Quotation

"Steady Quotation

The O
raft O
drew O
beyond O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
river; O
the O
boys O
pointed O
her O
head O
right, O
and O
then O
lay O
on O
their O
oars. O
The O
river O
was O
not O
high, O
so O
there O
was O
not O
more O
than O
a O
two O
or O
three O
mile O
current. O
Hardly O
a O
word O
was O
said O
during O
the O
next O
three-quarters O
of O
an O
hour. O
Now O
the O
raft O
was O
passing O
before O
the O
distant O
town. O
Two O
or O
three O
glimmering O
lights O
showed O
where O
it O
lay, O
peacefully O
sleeping, O
beyond O
the O
vague O
vast O
sweep O
of O
star-gemmed O
water, O
unconscious O
of O
the O
tremendous O
event O
that O
was O
happening. O
The O
Black O
Avenger O
stood O
still O
with O
folded O
arms, O
"looking O
his O
last" O
upon O
the O
scene O
of O
his O
former O
joys O
and O
his O
later O
sufferings, O
and O
wishing O
"she" O
could O
see O
him O
now, O
abroad O
on O
the O
wild O
sea, O
facing O
peril O
and O
death O
with O
dauntless O
heart, O
going O
to O
his O
doom O
with O
a O
grim O
smile O
on O
his O
lips. O
It O
was O
but O
a O
small O
strain O
on O
his O
imagination O
to O
remove O
Jackson's O
Island O
beyond O
eyeshot O
of O
the O
village, O
and O
so O
he O
"looked O
his O
last" O
with O
a O
broken O
and O
satisfied O
heart. O
The O
other O
pirates O
were O
looking O
their O
last, O
too; O
and O
they O
all O
looked O
so O
long O
that O
they O
came O
near O
letting O
the O
current O
drift O
them O
out O
of O
the O
range O
of O
the O
island. O
But O
they O
discovered O
the O
danger O
in O
time, O
and O
made O
shift O
to O
avert O
it. O
About O
two O
o'clock O
in O
the O
morning O
the O
raft O
grounded O
on O
the O
bar O
two O
hundred O
yards O
above O
the O
head O
of O
the O
island, O
and O
they O
waded O
back O
and O
forth O
until O
they O
had O
landed O
their O
freight. O
Part O
of O
the O
little O
raft's O
belongings O
consisted O
of O
an O
old O
sail, O
and O
this O
they O
spread O
over O
a O
nook O
in O
the O
bushes O
for O
a O
tent O
to O
shelter O
their O
provisions; O
but O
they O
themselves O
would O
sleep O
in O
the O
open O
air O
in O
good O
weather, O
as O
became O
outlaws. O
They O
built O
a O
fire O
against O
the O
side O
of O
a O
great O
log O
twenty O
or O
thirty O
steps O
within O
the O
sombre O
depths O
of O
the O
forest, O
and O
then O
cooked O
some O
bacon O
in O
the O
frying-pan O
for O
supper, O
and O
used O
up O
half O
of O
the O
corn O
"pone" O
stock O
they O
had O
brought. O
It O
seemed O
glorious O
sport O
to O
be O
feasting O
in O
that O
wild, O
free O
way O
in O
the O
virgin O
forest O
of O
an O
unexplored O
and O
uninhabited O
island, O
far O
from O
the O
haunts O
of O
men, O
and O
they O
said O
they O
never O
would O
return O
to O
civilization. O
The O
climbing O
fire O
lit O
up O
their O
faces O
and O
threw O
its O
ruddy O
glare O
upon O
the O
pillared O
tree-trunks O
of O
their O
forest O
temple, O
and O
upon O
the O
varnished O
foliage O
and O
festooning O
vines. O
When O
the O
last O
crisp O
slice O
of O
bacon O
was O
gone, O
and O
the O
last O
allowance O
of O
corn O
pone O
devoured, O
the O
boys O
stretched O
themselves O
out O
on O
the O
grass, O
filled O
with O
contentment. O
They O
could O
have O
found O
a O
cooler O
place, O
but O
they O
would O
not O
deny O
themselves O
such O
a O
romantic O
feature O
as O
the O
roasting O
camp-fire. O
"AIN'T Quotation

"It's Quotation
NUTS!" Quotation

"What Quotation

"Say? Quotation
Well, Quotation
they'd Quotation

"I Quotation

"You Quotation

You Quotation

"Oh Quotation
yes, Quotation
that's Quotation
so," Quotation
said Cue
Joe, Entity
"but Quotation
I Quotation
hadn't Quotation
thought Quotation
much Quotation

"You Quotation

said Cue
Tom, Entity
"people Quotation
don't Quotation

much Quotation
on Quotation
hermits, Quotation
nowadays, Quotation
like Quotation
they Quotation

a Quotation

always Quotation
respected. Quotation
And Quotation
a Quotation

"What Quotation

for?" Quotation
inquired Cue
Huck. Entity
"I Quotation
dono. Quotation
But Quotation
they've Quotation
GOT Quotation
to Quotation
do Quotation
it. Quotation
Hermits Quotation
always Quotation
do. Quotation
You'd Quotation

that Quotation

"Dern'd Quotation
if Quotation
I Quotation

said Cue
Huck. Entity
"Well, Quotation
what Quotation
would Quotation
you Quotation
do?" Quotation
"I Quotation

But Quotation
I Quotation
wouldn't Quotation

that." Quotation
"Why, Quotation
Huck, Quotation
you'd Quotation
HAVE Quotation
to. Quotation
How'd Quotation
you Quotation
get Quotation
around Quotation
it?" Quotation
"Why, Quotation
I Quotation
just Quotation
wouldn't Quotation
stand Quotation
it. Quotation
I'd Quotation
run Quotation

"Run Quotation
away! Quotation
Well, Quotation
you Quotation
WOULD Quotation
be Quotation
a Quotation
nice Quotation
old Quotation
slouch Quotation
of Quotation
a Quotation
hermit. Quotation
You'd Quotation
be Quotation
a Quotation
disgrace." Quotation
The O
Red-Handed O
made O
no O
response, O
being O
better O
employed. O
He O
had O
finished O
gouging O
out O
a O
cob, O
and O
now O
he O
fitted O
a O
weed O
stem O
to O
it, O
loaded O
it O
with O
tobacco, O
and O
was O
pressing O
a O
coal O
to O
the O
charge O
and O
blowing O
a O
cloud O
of O
fragrant O
smoke-- O
he O
was O
in O
the O
full O
bloom O
of O
luxurious O
contentment. O
The O
other O
pirates O
envied O
him O
this O
majestic O
vice, O
and O
secretly O
resolved O
to O
acquire O
it O
shortly. O
Presently O
Huck Entity
said: Cue
"What Quotation
does Quotation
pirates Quotation
have Quotation
to Quotation
do?" Quotation
Tom Entity
said: Cue
"Oh, Quotation
they Quotation
have Quotation
just Quotation
a Quotation
bully Quotation
time-- Quotation
take Quotation
ships Quotation
and Quotation
burn Quotation
them, Quotation
and Quotation
get Quotation
the Quotation
money Quotation
and Quotation
bury Quotation
it Quotation
in Quotation
awful Quotation
places Quotation
in Quotation
their Quotation
island Quotation
where Quotation
there's Quotation
ghosts Quotation
and Quotation
things Quotation
to Quotation
watch Quotation
it, Quotation
and Quotation
kill Quotation
everybody Quotation
in Quotation
the Quotation
ships-- Quotation
make Quotation
'em Quotation
walk Quotation
a Quotation
plank." Quotation
"And Quotation
they Quotation
carry Quotation
the Quotation
women Quotation
to Quotation
the Quotation
island," Quotation
said Cue
Joe; Entity
"they Quotation
don't Quotation
kill Quotation
the Quotation

"No," Quotation
assented Cue
Tom, Entity
"they Quotation
don't Quotation
kill Quotation
the Quotation
women-- Quotation
they're Quotation
too Quotation
noble. Quotation
And Quotation
the Quotation
women's Quotation
always Quotation
beautiful, Quotation
too." Quotation
"And Quotation
don't Quotation
they Quotation
wear Quotation
the Quotation
bulliest Quotation
clothes! Quotation
Oh Quotation
no! Quotation
All Quotation
gold Quotation
and Quotation
silver Quotation
and Quotation
di'monds," Quotation
said Cue
Joe, Entity
with O
enthusiasm. O
"Who?" Quotation
said Cue
Huck. Entity
"Why, Quotation
the Quotation
pirates." Quotation
Huck O
scanned O
his O
own O
clothing O
forlornly. O
"I Quotation
reckon Quotation
I Quotation
ain't Quotation
dressed Quotation
fitten Quotation
for Quotation
a Quotation
pirate," Quotation
said Cue
he, Entity
with O
a O
regretful O
pathos O
in O
his O
voice; O
"but Quotation
I Quotation
ain't Quotation
got Quotation
none Quotation
but Quotation
these." Quotation
But O
the Entity
other Entity
boys Entity
told Cue
him Entity
the Quotation
fine Quotation
clothes Quotation
would Quotation
come Quotation
fast Quotation
enough, Quotation
after Quotation
they Quotation
should Quotation
have Quotation
begun Quotation
their Quotation
adventures. Quotation
They O
made O
him O
understand O
that O
his O
poor O
rags O
would O
do O
to O
begin O
with, O
though O
it O
was O
customary O
for O
wealthy O
pirates O
to O
start O
with O
a O
proper O
wardrobe. O
Gradually O
their O
talk O
died O
out O
and O
drowsiness O
began O
to O
steal O
upon O
the O
eyelids O
of O
the O
little O
waifs. O
The O
pipe O
dropped O
from O
the O
fingers O
of O
the O
Red-Handed, O
and O
he O
slept O
the O
sleep O
of O
the O
conscience-free O
and O
the O
weary. O
The O
Terror O
of O
the O
Seas O
and O
the O
Black O
Avenger O
of O
the O
Spanish O
Main O
had O
more O
difficulty O
in O
getting O
to O
sleep. O
They O
said O
their O
prayers O
inwardly, O
and O
lying O
down, O
since O
there O
was O
nobody O
there O
with O
authority O
to O
make O
them O
kneel O
and O
recite O
aloud; O
in O
truth, O
they O
had O
a O
mind O
not O
to O
say O
them O
at O
all, O
but O
they O
were O
afraid O
to O
proceed O
to O
such O
lengths O
as O
that, O
lest O
they O
might O
call O
down O
a O
sudden O
and O
special O
thunderbolt O
from O
heaven. O
Then O
at O
once O
they O
reached O
and O
hovered O
upon O
the O
imminent O
verge O
of O
sleep-- O
but O
an O
intruder O
came, O
now, O
that O
would O
not O
"down." O
It O
was O
conscience. O
They O
began O
to O
feel O
a O
vague O
fear O
that O
they O
had O
been O
doing O
wrong O
to O
run O
away; O
and O
next O
they O
thought O
of O
the O
stolen O
meat, O
and O
then O
the O
real O
torture O
came. O
They O
tried O
to O
argue O
it O
away O
by O
reminding O
conscience O
that O
they O
had O
purloined O
sweetmeats O
and O
apples O
scores O
of O
times; O
but O
conscience O
was O
not O
to O
be O
appeased O
by O
such O
thin O
plausibilities; O
it O
seemed O
to O
them, O
in O
the O
end, O
that O
there O
was O
no O
getting O
around O
the O
stubborn O
fact O
that O
taking O
sweetmeats O
was O
only O
"hooking," O
while O
taking O
bacon O
and O
hams O
and O
such O
valuables O
was O
plain O
simple O
stealing-- O
and O
there O
was O
a O
command O
against O
that O
in O
the O
Bible. O
So O
they O
inwardly O
resolved O
that O
so O
long O
as O
they O
remained O
in O
the O
business, O
their O
piracies O
should O
not O
again O
be O
sullied O
with O
the O
crime O
of O
stealing. O
Then O
conscience O
granted O
a O
truce, O
and O
these O
curiously O
inconsistent O
pirates O
fell O
peacefully O
to O
sleep. O
CHAPTER O
XIV O
WHEN O
Tom O
awoke O
in O
the O
morning, O
he O
wondered O
where O
he O
was. O
He O
sat O
up O
and O
rubbed O
his O
eyes O
and O
looked O
around. O
Then O
he O
comprehended. O
It O
was O
the O
cool O
gray O
dawn, O
and O
there O
was O
a O
delicious O
sense O
of O
repose O
and O
peace O
in O
the O
deep O
pervading O
calm O
and O
silence O
of O
the O
woods. O
Not O
a O
leaf O
stirred; O
not O
a O
sound O
obtruded O
upon O
great O
Nature's O
meditation. O
Beaded O
dewdrops O
stood O
upon O
the O
leaves O
and O
grasses. O
A O
white O
layer O
of O
ashes O
covered O
the O
fire, O
and O
a O
thin O
blue O
breath O
of O
smoke O
rose O
straight O
into O
the O
air. O
Joe O
and O
Huck O
still O
slept. O
Now, O
far O
away O
in O
the O
woods O
a O
bird O
called; O
another O
answered; O
presently O
the O
hammering O
of O
a O
woodpecker O
was O
heard. O
Gradually O
the O
cool O
dim O
gray O
of O
the O
morning O
whitened, O
and O
as O
gradually O
sounds O
multiplied O
and O
life O
manifested O
itself. O
The O
marvel O
of O
Nature O
shaking O
off O
sleep O
and O
going O
to O
work O
unfolded O
itself O
to O
the O
musing O
boy. O
A O
little O
green O
worm O
came O
crawling O
over O
a O
dewy O
leaf, O
lifting O
two-thirds O
of O
his O
body O
into O
the O
air O
from O
time O
to O
time O
and O
"sniffing O
around," O
then O
proceeding O
again-- O
for O
he Quotation
was Quotation
measuring, Quotation
Tom Entity
said; Cue
and O
when O
the O
worm O
approached O
him, O
of O
its O
own O
accord, O
he O
sat O
as O
still O
as O
a O
stone, O
with O
his O
hopes O
rising O
and O
falling, O
by O
turns, O
as O
the O
creature O
still O
came O
toward O
him O
or O
seemed O
inclined O
to O
go O
elsewhere; O
and O
when O
at O
last O
it O
considered O
a O
painful O
moment O
with O
its O
curved O
body O
in O
the O
air O
and O
then O
came O
decisively O
down O
upon O
Tom's O
leg O
and O
began O
a O
journey O
over O
him, O
his O
whole O
heart O
was O
glad-- O
for O
that O
meant O
that O
he O
was O
going O
to O
have O
a O
new O
suit O
of O
clothes-- O
without O
the O
shadow O
of O
a O
doubt O
a O
gaudy O
piratical O
uniform. O
Now O
a O
procession O
of O
ants O
appeared, O
from O
nowhere O
in O
particular, O
and O
went O
about O
their O
labors; O
one O
struggled O
manfully O
by O
with O
a O
dead O
spider O
five O
times O
as O
big O
as O
itself O
in O
its O
arms, O
and O
lugged O
it O
straight O
up O
a O
tree-trunk. O
A Entity
brown Entity
spotted Entity
lady-bug Entity
climbed O
the O
dizzy O
height O
of O
a O
grass O
blade, O
and O
Tom Entity
bent O
down O
close O
to O
it O
and O
said, Cue
"Lady-bug, Quotation
lady-bug, Quotation
fly Quotation
away Quotation
home, Quotation
your Quotation
house Quotation
is Quotation
on Quotation
fire, Quotation
your Quotation
children's Quotation
alone," Quotation
and O
she O
took O
wing O
and O
went O
off O
to O
see O
about O
it O
--which O
did O
not O
surprise O
the O
boy, O
for O
he O
knew O
of O
old O
that O
this O
insect O
was O
credulous O
about O
conflagrations, O
and O
he O
had O
practised O
upon O
its O
simplicity O
more O
than O
once. O
A O
tumblebug O
came O
next, O
heaving O
sturdily O
at O
its O
ball, O
and O
Tom O
touched O
the O
creature, O
to O
see O
it O
shut O
its O
legs O
against O
its O
body O
and O
pretend O
to O
be O
dead. O
The O
birds O
were O
fairly O
rioting O
by O
this O
time. O
A O
catbird, O
the O
Northern O
mocker, O
lit O
in O
a O
tree O
over O
Tom's O
head, O
and O
trilled O
out O
her O
imitations O
of O
her O
neighbors O
in O
a O
rapture O
of O
enjoyment; O
then O
a O
shrill O
jay O
swept O
down, O
a O
flash O
of O
blue O
flame, O
and O
stopped O
on O
a O
twig O
almost O
within O
the O
boy's O
reach, O
cocked O
his O
head O
to O
one O
side O
and O
eyed O
the O
strangers O
with O
a O
consuming O
curiosity; O
a O
gray O
squirrel O
and O
a O
big O
fellow O
of O
the O
"fox" O
kind O
came O
skurrying O
along, O
sitting O
up O
at O
intervals O
to O
inspect O
and O
chatter O
at O
the O
boys, O
for O
the O
wild O
things O
had O
probably O
never O
seen O
a O
human O
being O
before O
and O
scarcely O
knew O
whether O
to O
be O
afraid O
or O
not. O
All O
Nature O
was O
wide O
awake O
and O
stirring, O
now; O
long O
lances O
of O
sunlight O
pierced O
down O
through O
the O
dense O
foliage O
far O
and O
near, O
and O
a O
few O
butterflies O
came O
fluttering O
upon O
the O
scene. O
Tom O
stirred O
up O
the O
other O
pirates O
and O
they O
all O
clattered O
away O
with O
a O
shout, O
and O
in O
a O
minute O
or O
two O
were O
stripped O
and O
chasing O
after O
and O
tumbling O
over O
each O
other O
in O
the O
shallow O
limpid O
water O
of O
the O
white O
sandbar. O
They O
felt O
no O
longing O
for O
the O
little O
village O
sleeping O
in O
the O
distance O
beyond O
the O
majestic O
waste O
of O
water. O
A O
vagrant O
current O
or O
a O
slight O
rise O
in O
the O
river O
had O
carried O
off O
their O
raft, O
but O
this O
only O
gratified O
them, O
since O
its O
going O
was O
something O
like O
burning O
the O
bridge O
between O
them O
and O
civilization. O
They O
came O
back O
to O
camp O
wonderfully O
refreshed, O
glad-hearted, O
and O
ravenous; O
and O
they O
soon O
had O
the O
camp-fire O
blazing O
up O
again. O
Huck O
found O
a O
spring O
of O
clear O
cold O
water O
close O
by, O
and O
the O
boys O
made O
cups O
of O
broad O
oak O
or O
hickory O
leaves, O
and O
felt O
that O
water, O
sweetened O
with O
such O
a O
wildwood O
charm O
as O
that, O
would O
be O
a O
good O
enough O
substitute O
for O
coffee. O
While O
Joe O
was O
slicing O
bacon O
for O
breakfast, O
Tom Entity
and Entity
Huck Entity
asked Cue
him Entity
to Quotation
hold Quotation
on Quotation
a Quotation
minute; Quotation
they O
stepped O
to O
a O
promising O
nook O
in O
the O
river-bank O
and O
threw O
in O
their O
lines; O
almost O
immediately O
they O
had O
reward. O
Joe O
had O
not O
had O
time O
to O
get O
impatient O
before O
they O
were O
back O
again O
with O
some O
handsome O
bass, O
a O
couple O
of O
sun-perch O
and O
a O
small O
catfish-- O
provisions O
enough O
for O
quite O
a O
family. O
They O
fried O
the O
fish O
with O
the O
bacon, O
and O
were O
astonished; O
for O
no O
fish O
had O
ever O
seemed O
so O
delicious O
before. O
They O
did O
not O
know O
that O
the O
quicker O
a O
fresh-water O
fish O
is O
on O
the O
fire O
after O
he O
is O
caught O
the O
better O
he O
is; O
and O
they O
reflected O
little O
upon O
what O
a O
sauce O
open-air O
sleeping, O
open-air O
exercise, O
bathing, O
and O
a O
large O
ingredient O
of O
hunger O
make, O
too. O
They O
lay O
around O
in O
the O
shade, O
after O
breakfast, O
while O
Huck O
had O
a O
smoke, O
and O
then O
went O
off O
through O
the O
woods O
on O
an O
exploring O
expedition. O
They O
tramped O
gayly O
along, O
over O
decaying O
logs, O
through O
tangled O
underbrush, O
among O
solemn O
monarchs O
of O
the O
forest, O
hung O
from O
their O
crowns O
to O
the O
ground O
with O
a O
drooping O
regalia O
of O
grape-vines. O
Now O
and O
then O
they O
came O
upon O
snug O
nooks O
carpeted O
with O
grass O
and O
jeweled O
with O
flowers. O
They O
found O
plenty O
of O
things O
to O
be O
delighted O
with, O
but O
nothing O
to O
be O
astonished O
at. O
They O
discovered O
that O
the O
island O
was O
about O
three O
miles O
long O
and O
a O
quarter O
of O
a O
mile O
wide, O
and O
that O
the O
shore O
it O
lay O
closest O
to O
was O
only O
separated O
from O
it O
by O
a O
narrow O
channel O
hardly O
two O
hundred O
yards O
wide. O
They O
took O
a O
swim O
about O
every O
hour, O
so O
it O
was O
close O
upon O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
afternoon O
when O
they O
got O
back O
to O
camp. O
They O
were O
too O
hungry O
to O
stop O
to O
fish, O
but O
they O
fared O
sumptuously O
upon O
cold O
ham, O
and O
then O
threw O
themselves O
down O
in O
the O
shade O
to O
talk. O
But O
the O
talk O
soon O
began O
to O
drag, O
and O
then O
died. O
The O
stillness, O
the O
solemnity O
that O
brooded O
in O
the O
woods, O
and O
the O
sense O
of O
loneliness, O
began O
to O
tell O
upon O
the O
spirits O
of O
the O
boys. O
They O
fell O
to O
thinking. O
A O
sort O
of O
undefined O
longing O
crept O
upon O
them. O
This O
took O
dim O
shape, O
presently-- O
it O
was O
budding O
homesickness. O
Even O
Finn O
the O
Red-Handed O
was O
dreaming O
of O
his O
doorsteps O
and O
empty O
hogsheads. O
But O
they O
were O
all O
ashamed O
of O
their O
weakness, O
and O
none O
was O
brave O
enough O
to O
speak O
his O
thought. O
For O
some O
time, O
now, O
the O
boys O
had O
been O
dully O
conscious O
of O
a O
peculiar O
sound O
in O
the O
distance, O
just O
as O
one O
sometimes O
is O
of O
the O
ticking O
of O
a O
clock O
which O
he O
takes O
no O
distinct O
note O
of. O
But O
now O
this O
mysterious O
sound O
became O
more O
pronounced, O
and O
forced O
a O
recognition. O
The O
boys O
started, O
glanced O
at O
each O
other, O
and O
then O
each O
assumed O
a O
listening O
attitude. O
There O
was O
a O
long O
silence, O
profound O
and O
unbroken; O
then O
a O
deep, O
sullen O
boom O
came O
floating O
down O
out O
of O
the O
distance. O
"What Quotation
is Quotation
it!" Quotation
exclaimed Cue
Joe, Entity
under O
his O
breath. O
"I Quotation
wonder," Quotation
said Cue
Tom Entity
in O
a O
whisper. O
"'Tain't Quotation
thunder," Quotation
said Cue
Huckleberry, Entity
in O
an O
awed O
tone, O
"becuz Quotation
thunder Quotation
-- Quotation
" Quotation
"Hark!" Quotation
said Cue
Tom. Entity
"Listen-- Quotation
don't Quotation
talk." Quotation
They O
waited O
a O
time O
that O
seemed O
an O
age, O
and O
then O
the O
same O
muffled O
boom O
troubled O
the O
solemn O
hush. O
"Let's Quotation
go Quotation
and Quotation
see." Quotation
They O
sprang O
to O
their O
feet O
and O
hurried O
to O
the O
shore O
toward O
the O
town. O
They O
parted O
the O
bushes O
on O
the O
bank O
and O
peered O
out O
over O
the O
water. O
The O
little O
steam O
ferryboat O
was O
about O
a O
mile O
below O
the O
village, O
drifting O
with O
the O
current. O
Her O
broad O
deck O
seemed O
crowded O
with O
people. O
There O
were O
a O
great O
many O
skiffs O
rowing O
about O
or O
floating O
with O
the O
stream O
in O
the O
neighborhood O
of O
the O
ferryboat, O
but O
the O
boys O
could O
not O
determine O
what O
the O
men O
in O
them O
were O
doing. O
Presently O
a O
great O
jet O
of O
white O
smoke O
burst O
from O
the O
ferryboat's O
side, O
and O
as O
it O
expanded O
and O
rose O
in O
a O
lazy O
cloud, O
that O
same O
dull O
throb O
of O
sound O
was O
borne O
to O
the O
listeners O
again. O
"I Quotation
know Quotation
now!" Quotation
exclaimed Cue
Tom; Entity
"somebody's Quotation
drownded!" Quotation
"That's Quotation
it!" Quotation
said Cue
Huck; Entity
"they Quotation
done Quotation
that Quotation
last Quotation
summer, Quotation
when Quotation
Bill Quotation
Turner Quotation
got Quotation
drownded; Quotation
they Quotation
shoot Quotation
a Quotation
cannon Quotation
over Quotation
the Quotation
water, Quotation
and Quotation
that Quotation
makes Quotation
him Quotation
come Quotation
up Quotation
to Quotation
the Quotation
top. Quotation
Yes, Quotation
and Quotation
they Quotation
take Quotation
loaves Quotation
of Quotation
bread Quotation
and Quotation
put Quotation
quicksilver Quotation
in Quotation
'em Quotation
and Quotation
set Quotation
'em Quotation
afloat, Quotation
and Quotation
wherever Quotation
there's Quotation
anybody Quotation
that's Quotation
drownded, Quotation
they'll Quotation
float Quotation
right Quotation
there Quotation
and Quotation
stop." Quotation
"Yes, Quotation
I've Quotation
heard Quotation
about Quotation
that," Quotation
said Cue
Joe. Entity
"I Quotation
wonder Quotation
what Quotation
makes Quotation
the Quotation
bread Quotation
do Quotation
that." Quotation
"Oh, Quotation
it Quotation
ain't Quotation
the Quotation
bread, Quotation
so Quotation
much," Quotation
said Cue
Tom; Entity
"I Quotation
reckon Quotation
it's Quotation
mostly Quotation
what Quotation
they Quotation
SAY Quotation
over Quotation
it Quotation
before Quotation
they Quotation
start Quotation
it Quotation
out." Quotation
"But Quotation
they Quotation
don't Quotation
say Quotation
anything Quotation
over Quotation
it," Quotation
said Cue
Huck. Entity
"I've Quotation
seen Quotation
'em Quotation
and Quotation
they Quotation
don't." Quotation
"Well, Quotation
that's Quotation
funny," Quotation
said Cue
Tom. Entity
"But Quotation
maybe Quotation
they Quotation
say Quotation
it Quotation
to Quotation
themselves. Quotation
Of Quotation
COURSE Quotation
they Quotation
do. Quotation
Anybody Quotation
might Quotation
know Quotation
that." Quotation
The Entity
other Entity
boys Entity
agreed Cue
that Quotation
there Quotation
was Quotation
reason Quotation
in Quotation
what Quotation
Tom Quotation
said, Quotation
because Quotation
an Quotation
ignorant Quotation
lump Quotation
of Quotation
bread, Quotation
uninstructed Quotation
by Quotation
an Quotation
incantation, Quotation
could Quotation
not Quotation
be Quotation
expected Quotation
to Quotation
act Quotation
very Quotation
intelligently Quotation
when Quotation
set Quotation
upon Quotation
an Quotation
errand Quotation
of Quotation
such Quotation
gravity. Quotation
"By Quotation
jings, Quotation
I Quotation
wish Quotation
I Quotation
was Quotation
over Quotation
there, Quotation
now," Quotation
said Cue
Joe. Entity
"I Quotation
do Quotation
too" Quotation
said Cue
Huck Entity
"I'd Quotation
give Quotation
heaps Quotation
to Quotation
know Quotation
who Quotation
it Quotation
is." Quotation
The O
boys O
still O
listened O
and O
watched. O
Presently O
a O
revealing O
thought O
flashed O
through O
Tom's O
mind, O
and O
he Entity
exclaimed: Cue
"Boys, Quotation
I Quotation
know Quotation
who's Quotation
drownded-- Quotation
it's Quotation
us!" Quotation
They O
felt O
like O
heroes O
in O
an O
instant. O
Here O
was O
a O
gorgeous O
triumph; O
they O
were O
missed; O
they O
were O
mourned; O
hearts O
were O
breaking O
on O
their O
account; O
tears O
were O
being O
shed; O
accusing O
memories O
of O
unkindness O
to O
these O
poor O
lost O
lads O
were O
rising O
up, O
and O
unavailing O
regrets O
and O
remorse O
were O
being O
indulged; O
and O
best O
of O
all, O
the O
departed O
were O
the O
talk O
of O
the O
whole O
town, O
and O
the O
envy O
of O
all O
the O
boys, O
as O
far O
as O
this O
dazzling O
notoriety O
was O
concerned. O
This O
was O
fine. O
It O
was O
worth O
while O
to O
be O
a O
pirate, O
after O
all. O
As O
twilight O
drew O
on, O
the O
ferryboat O
went O
back O
to O
her O
accustomed O
business O
and O
the O
skiffs O
disappeared. O
The O
pirates O
returned O
to O
camp. O
They O
were O
jubilant O
with O
vanity O
over O
their O
new O
grandeur O
and O
the O
illustrious O
trouble O
they O
were O
making. O
They O
caught O
fish, O
cooked O
supper O
and O
ate O
it, O
and O
then O
fell O
to O
guessing O
at O
what O
the O
village O
was O
thinking O
and O
saying O
about O
them; O
and O
the O
pictures O
they O
drew O
of O
the O
public O
distress O
on O
their O
account O
were O
gratifying O
to O
look O
upon-- O
from O
their O
point O
of O
view. O
But O
when O
the O
shadows O
of O
night O
closed O
them O
in, O
they O
gradually O
ceased O
to O
talk, O
and O
sat O
gazing O
into O
the O
fire, O
with O
their O
minds O
evidently O
wandering O
elsewhere. O
The O
excitement O
was O
gone, O
now, O
and O
Tom O
and O
Joe O
could O
not O
keep O
back O
thoughts O
of O
certain O
persons O
at O
home O
who O
were O
not O
enjoying O
this O
fine O
frolic O
as O
much O
as O
they O
were. O
Misgivings O
came; O
they O
grew O
troubled O
and O
unhappy; O
a O
sigh O
or O
two O
escaped, O
unawares. O
By O
and O
by O
Joe O
timidly O
ventured O
upon O
a O
roundabout O
"feeler" O
as O
to O
how O
the O
others O
might O
look O
upon O
a O
return O
to O
civilization-- O
not O
right O
now, O
but-- O
Tom O
withered O
him O
with O
derision! O
Huck, O
being O
uncommitted O
as O
yet, O
joined O
in O
with O
Tom, O
and O
the O
waverer O
quickly O
"explained," O
and O
was O
glad O
to O
get O
out O
of O
the O
scrape O
with O
as O
little O
taint O
of O
chicken-hearted O
homesickness O
clinging O
to O
his O
garments O
as O
he O
could. O
Mutiny O
was O
effectually O
laid O
to O
rest O
for O
the O
moment. O
As O
the O
night O
deepened, O
Huck O
began O
to O
nod, O
and O
presently O
to O
snore. O
Joe O
followed O
next. O
Tom O
lay O
upon O
his O
elbow O
motionless, O
for O
some O
time, O
watching O
the O
two O
intently. O
At O
last O
he O
got O
up O
cautiously, O
on O
his O
knees, O
and O
went O
searching O
among O
the O
grass O
and O
the O
flickering O
reflections O
flung O
by O
the O
camp-fire. O
He O
picked O
up O
and O
inspected O
several O
large O
semi-cylinders O
of O
the O
thin O
white O
bark O
of O
a O
sycamore, O
and O
finally O
chose O
two O
which O
seemed O
to O
suit O
him. O
Then O
he O
knelt O
by O
the O
fire O
and O
painfully O
wrote O
something O
upon O
each O
of O
these O
with O
his O
"red O
keel"; O
one O
he O
rolled O
up O
and O
put O
in O
his O
jacket O
pocket, O
and O
the O
other O
he O
put O
in O
Joe's O
hat O
and O
removed O
it O
to O
a O
little O
distance O
from O
the O
owner. O
And O
he O
also O
put O
into O
the O
hat O
certain O
schoolboy O
treasures O
of O
almost O
inestimable O
value-- O
among O
them O
a O
lump O
of O
chalk, O
an O
India-rubber O
ball, O
three O
fishhooks, O
and O
one O
of O
that O
kind O
of O
marbles O
known O
as O
a O
"sure O
'nough O
crystal." O
Then O
he O
tiptoed O
his O
way O
cautiously O
among O
the O
trees O
till O
he O
felt O
that O
he O
was O
out O
of O
hearing, O
and O
straightway O
broke O
into O
a O
keen O
run O
in O
the O
direction O
of O
the O
sandbar. O
CHAPTER O
XV O
A O
FEW O
minutes O
later O
Tom O
was O
in O
the O
shoal O
water O
of O
the O
bar, O
wading O
toward O
the O
Illinois O
shore. O
Before O
the O
depth O
reached O
his O
middle O
he O
was O
half-way O
over; O
the O
current O
would O
permit O
no O
more O
wading, O
now, O
so O
he O
struck O
out O
confidently O
to O
swim O
the O
remaining O
hundred O
yards. O
He O
swam O
quartering O
upstream, O
but O
still O
was O
swept O
downward O
rather O
faster O
than O
he O
had O
expected. O
However, O
he O
reached O
the O
shore O
finally, O
and O
drifted O
along O
till O
he O
found O
a O
low O
place O
and O
drew O
himself O
out. O
He O
put O
his O
hand O
on O
his O
jacket O
pocket, O
found O
his O
piece O
of O
bark O
safe, O
and O
then O
struck O
through O
the O
woods, O
following O
the O
shore, O
with O
streaming O
garments. O
Shortly O
before O
ten O
o'clock O
he O
came O
out O
into O
an O
open O
place O
opposite O
the O
village, O
and O
saw O
the O
ferryboat O
lying O
in O
the O
shadow O
of O
the O
trees O
and O
the O
high O
bank. O
Everything O
was O
quiet O
under O
the O
blinking O
stars. O
He O
crept O
down O
the O
bank, O
watching O
with O
all O
his O
eyes, O
slipped O
into O
the O
water, O
swam O
three O
or O
four O
strokes O
and O
climbed O
into O
the O
skiff O
that O
did O
"yawl" O
duty O
at O
the O
boat's O
stern. O
He O
laid O
himself O
down O
under O
the O
thwarts O
and O
waited, O
panting. O
Presently O
the O
cracked O
bell O
tapped O
and O
a O
voice O
gave O
the O
order O
to O
"cast O
off." O
A O
minute O
or O
two O
later O
the O
skiff's O
head O
was O
standing O
high O
up, O
against O
the O
boat's O
swell, O
and O
the O
voyage O
was O
begun. O
Tom O
felt O
happy O
in O
his O
success, O
for O
he O
knew O
it O
was O
the O
boat's O
last O
trip O
for O
the O
night. O
At O
the O
end O
of O
a O
long O
twelve O
or O
fifteen O
minutes O
the O
wheels O
stopped, O
and O
Tom O
slipped O
overboard O
and O
swam O
ashore O
in O
the O
dusk, O
landing O
fifty O
yards O
downstream, O
out O
of O
danger O
of O
possible O
stragglers. O
He O
flew O
along O
unfrequented O
alleys, O
and O
shortly O
found O
himself O
at O
his O
aunt's O
back O
fence. O
He O
climbed O
over, O
approached O
the O
"ell," O
and O
looked O
in O
at O
the O
sitting-room O
window, O
for O
a O
light O
was O
burning O
there. O
There O
sat O
Aunt O
Polly, O
Sid, Entity
Mary, O
and O
Joe O
Harper's O
mother, O
grouped O
together, O
talking. O
They O
were O
by O
the O
bed, O
and O
the O
bed O
was O
between O
them O
and O
the O
door. O
Tom O
went O
to O
the O
door O
and O
began O
to O
softly O
lift O
the O
latch; O
then O
he O
pressed O
gently O
and O
the O
door O
yielded O
a O
crack; O
he O
continued O
pushing O
cautiously, O
and O
quaking O
every O
time O
it O
creaked, O
till O
he O
judged O
he O
might O
squeeze O
through O
on O
his O
knees; O
so O
he O
put O
his O
head O
through O
and O
began, O
warily. O
"What Quotation
makes Quotation
the Quotation
candle Quotation
blow Quotation
so?" Quotation
said Cue
Aunt Entity
Polly. Entity
Tom O
hurried O
up. O
"Why, Quotation
that Quotation
door's Quotation
open, Quotation
I Quotation
believe. Quotation
Why, Quotation
of Quotation
course Quotation
it Quotation
is. Quotation
No Quotation
end Quotation
of Quotation
strange Quotation
things Quotation
now. Quotation
Go Quotation
'long Quotation
and Quotation
shut Quotation
it, Quotation
Sid." Quotation
Tom O
disappeared O
under O
the O
bed O
just O
in O
time. O
He O
lay O
and O
"breathed" O
himself O
for O
a O
time, O
and O
then O
crept O
to O
where O
he O
could O
almost O
touch O
his O
aunt's O
foot. O
"But Quotation
as Quotation
I Quotation
was Quotation
saying," Quotation
said Cue
Aunt Entity
Polly, Entity
"he Quotation
warn't Quotation
BAD, Quotation
so Quotation
to Quotation
say Quotation
--only Quotation
mischEEvous. Quotation
Only Quotation
just Quotation
giddy, Quotation
and Quotation
harum-scarum, Quotation
you Quotation
know. Quotation
He Quotation
warn't Quotation
any Quotation
more Quotation
responsible Quotation
than Quotation
a Quotation
colt. Quotation
HE Quotation
never Quotation
meant Quotation
any Quotation
harm, Quotation
and Quotation
he Quotation
was Quotation
the Quotation
best-hearted Quotation
boy Quotation
that Quotation
ever Quotation
was"-- Quotation
and O
she O
began O
to O
cry. O
"It Quotation
was Quotation
just Quotation
so Quotation
with Quotation
my Quotation
Joe-- Quotation
always Quotation
full Quotation
of Quotation
his Quotation
devilment, Quotation
and Quotation
up Quotation
to Quotation
every Quotation
kind Quotation
of Quotation
mischief, Quotation
but Quotation
he Quotation
was Quotation
just Quotation
as Quotation
unselfish Quotation
and Quotation
kind Quotation
as Quotation
he Quotation
could Quotation
be-- Quotation
and Quotation
laws Quotation
bless Quotation
me, Quotation
to Quotation
think Quotation
I Quotation
went Quotation
and Quotation
whipped Quotation
him Quotation
for Quotation
taking Quotation
that Quotation
cream, Quotation
never Quotation
once Quotation
recollecting Quotation
that Quotation
I Quotation
throwed Quotation
it Quotation
out Quotation
myself Quotation
because Quotation
it Quotation
was Quotation
sour, Quotation
and Quotation
I Quotation
never Quotation
to Quotation
see Quotation
him Quotation
again Quotation
in Quotation
this Quotation
world, Quotation
never, Quotation
never, Quotation
never, Quotation
poor Quotation
abused Quotation
boy!" Quotation
And O
Mrs. Entity
Harper Entity
sobbed O
as O
if O
her O
heart O
would O
break. O
"I Quotation
hope Quotation
Tom's Quotation
better Quotation
off Quotation
where Quotation
he Quotation
is," Quotation
said Cue
Sid, Entity
"but Quotation
if Quotation
he'd Quotation
been Quotation
better Quotation
in Quotation
some Quotation
ways Quotation
-- Quotation
" Quotation
"SID!" Quotation
Tom O
felt O
the O
glare O
of O
the Entity
old Entity
lady's Entity
eye, O
though O
he O
could O
not O
see O
it. O
"Not Quotation
a Quotation
word Quotation
against Quotation
my Quotation
Tom, Quotation
now Quotation
that Quotation
he's Quotation
gone! Quotation
God'll Quotation
take Quotation
care Quotation
of Quotation
HIM-- Quotation
never Quotation
you Quotation
trouble Quotation
YOURself, Quotation
sir! Quotation
Oh, Quotation
Mrs. Quotation
Harper, Quotation
I Quotation
don't Quotation
know Quotation
how Quotation
to Quotation
give Quotation
him Quotation
up! Quotation
I Quotation
don't Quotation
know Quotation
how Quotation
to Quotation
give Quotation
him Quotation
up! Quotation
He Quotation
was Quotation
such Quotation
a Quotation
comfort Quotation
to Quotation
me, Quotation
although Quotation
he Quotation
tormented Quotation
my Quotation
old Quotation
heart Quotation
out Quotation
of Quotation
me, Quotation
'most." Quotation
"The Quotation
Lord Quotation
giveth Quotation
and Quotation
the Quotation
Lord Quotation
hath Quotation
taken Quotation
away-- Quotation
Blessed Quotation
be Quotation
the Quotation
name Quotation
of Quotation
the Quotation
Lord! Quotation
But Quotation
it's Quotation
so Quotation
hard-- Quotation
Oh, Quotation
it's Quotation
so Quotation
hard! Quotation
Only Quotation
last Quotation
Saturday Quotation
my Quotation
Joe Quotation
busted Quotation
a Quotation
firecracker Quotation
right Quotation
under Quotation
my Quotation
nose Quotation
and Quotation
I Quotation
knocked Quotation
him Quotation
sprawling. Quotation
Little Quotation
did Quotation
I Quotation
know Quotation
then, Quotation
how Quotation
soon-- Quotation
Oh, Quotation
if Quotation
it Quotation
was Quotation
to Quotation
do Quotation
over Quotation
again Quotation
I'd Quotation
hug Quotation
him Quotation
and Quotation
bless Quotation
him Quotation
for Quotation
it." Quotation
"Yes, Quotation
yes, Quotation
yes, Quotation
I Quotation
know Quotation
just Quotation
how Quotation
you Quotation
feel, Quotation
Mrs. Quotation
Harper, Quotation
I Quotation
know Quotation
just Quotation
exactly Quotation
how Quotation
you Quotation
feel. Quotation
No Quotation
longer Quotation
ago Quotation
than Quotation
yesterday Quotation
noon, Quotation
my Quotation
Tom Quotation
took Quotation
and Quotation
filled Quotation
the Quotation
cat Quotation
full Quotation
of Quotation
Pain-killer, Quotation
and Quotation
I Quotation
did Quotation
think Quotation
the Quotation
cretur Quotation
would Quotation
tear Quotation
the Quotation
house Quotation
down. Quotation
And Quotation
God Quotation
forgive Quotation
me, Quotation
I Quotation
cracked Quotation
Tom's Quotation
head Quotation
with Quotation
my Quotation
thimble, Quotation
poor Quotation
boy, Quotation
poor Quotation
dead Quotation
boy. Quotation
But Quotation
he's Quotation
out Quotation
of Quotation
all Quotation
his Quotation
troubles Quotation
now. Quotation
And Quotation
the Quotation
last Quotation
words Quotation
I Quotation
ever Quotation
heard Quotation
him Quotation
say Quotation
was Quotation
to Quotation
reproach Quotation
-- Quotation
" Quotation
But O
this O
memory O
was O
too O
much O
for O
the O
old O
lady, O
and O
she O
broke O
entirely O
down. O
Tom O
was O
snuffling, O
now, O
himself-- O
and O
more O
in O
pity O
of O
himself O
than O
anybody O
else. O
He O
could O
hear O
Mary O
crying, O
and O
putting O
in O
a O
kindly O
word O
for O
him O
from O
time O
to O
time. O
He O
began O
to O
have O
a O
nobler O
opinion O
of O
himself O
than O
ever O
before. O
Still, O
he O
was O
sufficiently O
touched O
by O
his O
aunt's O
grief O
to O
long O
to O
rush O
out O
from O
under O
the O
bed O
and O
overwhelm O
her O
with O
joy-- O
and O
the O
theatrical O
gorgeousness O
of O
the O
thing O
appealed O
strongly O
to O
his O
nature, O
too, O
but O
he O
resisted O
and O
lay O
still. O
He O
went O
on O
listening, O
and O
gathered O
by O
odds O
and O
ends O
that O
it O
was O
conjectured O
at O
first O
that O
the O
boys O
had O
got O
drowned O
while O
taking O
a O
swim; O
then O
the O
small O
raft O
had O
been O
missed; O
next, O
certain O
boys O
said O
the O
missing O
lads O
had O
promised O
that O
the O
village O
should O
"hear O
something" O
soon; O
the O
wise-heads O
had O
"put O
this O
and O
that O
together" O
and O
decided O
that O
the O
lads O
had O
gone O
off O
on O
that O
raft O
and O
would O
turn O
up O
at O
the O
next O
town O
below, O
presently; O
but O
toward O
noon O
the O
raft O
had O
been O
found, O
lodged O
against O
the O
Missouri O
shore O
some O
five O
or O
six O
miles O
below O
the O
village O
--and O
then O
hope O
perished; O
they O
must O
be O
drowned, O
else O
hunger O
would O
have O
driven O
them O
home O
by O
nightfall O
if O
not O
sooner. O
It O
was O
believed O
that O
the O
search O
for O
the O
bodies O
had O
been O
a O
fruitless O
effort O
merely O
because O
the O
drowning O
must O
have O
occurred O
in O
mid-channel, O
since O
the O
boys, O
being O
good O
swimmers, O
would O
otherwise O
have O
escaped O
to O
shore. O
This O
was O
Wednesday O
night. O
If O
the O
bodies O
continued O
missing O
until O
Sunday, O
all O
hope O
would O
be O
given O
over, O
and O
the O
funerals O
would O
be O
preached O
on O
that O
morning. O
Tom O
shuddered. O
Mrs. Entity
Harper Entity
gave Cue
a Quotation
sobbing Quotation
good-night Quotation
and O
turned O
to O
go. O
Then O
with O
a O
mutual O
impulse O
the O
two O
bereaved O
women O
flung O
themselves O
into O
each O
other's O
arms O
and O
had O
a O
good, O
consoling O
cry, O
and O
then O
parted. O
Aunt O
Polly O
was O
tender O
far O
beyond O
her O
wont, O
in O
her O
good-night O
to O
Sid O
and O
Mary. O
Sid O
snuffled O
a O
bit O
and O
Mary O
went O
off O
crying O
with O
all O
her O
heart. O
Aunt O
Polly O
knelt O
down O
and O
prayed O
for O
Tom O
so O
touchingly, O
so O
appealingly, O
and O
with O
such O
measureless O
love O
in O
her O
words O
and O
her O
old O
trembling O
voice, O
that O
he O
was O
weltering O
in O
tears O
again, O
long O
before O
she O
was O
through. O
He O
had O
to O
keep O
still O
long O
after O
she O
went O
to O
bed, O
for O
she O
kept O
making O
broken-hearted O
ejaculations O
from O
time O
to O
time, O
tossing O
unrestfully, O
and O
turning O
over. O
But O
at O
last O
she O
was O
still, O
only O
moaning O
a O
little O
in O
her O
sleep. O
Now O
the O
boy O
stole O
out, O
rose O
gradually O
by O
the O
bedside, O
shaded O
the O
candle-light O
with O
his O
hand, O
and O
stood O
regarding O
her. O
His O
heart O
was O
full O
of O
pity O
for O
her. O
He O
took O
out O
his O
sycamore O
scroll O
and O
placed O
it O
by O
the O
candle. O
But O
something O
occurred O
to O
him, O
and O
he O
lingered O
considering. O
His O
face O
lighted O
with O
a O
happy O
solution O
of O
his O
thought; O
he O
put O
the O
bark O
hastily O
in O
his O
pocket. O
Then O
he O
bent O
over O
and O
kissed O
the O
faded O
lips, O
and O
straightway O
made O
his O
stealthy O
exit, O
latching O
the O
door O
behind O
him. O
He O
threaded O
his O
way O
back O
to O
the O
ferry O
landing, O
found O
nobody O
at O
large O
there, O
and O
walked O
boldly O
on O
board O
the O
boat, O
for O
he O
knew O
she O
was O
tenantless O
except O
that O
there O
was O
a O
watchman, O
who O
always O
turned O
in O
and O
slept O
like O
a O
graven O
image. O
He O
untied O
the O
skiff O
at O
the O
stern, O
slipped O
into O
it, O
and O
was O
soon O
rowing O
cautiously O
upstream. O
When O
he O
had O
pulled O
a O
mile O
above O
the O
village, O
he O
started O
quartering O
across O
and O
bent O
himself O
stoutly O
to O
his O
work. O
He O
hit O
the O
landing O
on O
the O
other O
side O
neatly, O
for O
this O
was O
a O
familiar O
bit O
of O
work O
to O
him. O
He O
was O
moved O
to O
capture O
the O
skiff, O
arguing O
that O
it O
might O
be O
considered O
a O
ship O
and O
therefore O
legitimate O
prey O
for O
a O
pirate, O
but O
he O
knew O
a O
thorough O
search O
would O
be O
made O
for O
it O
and O
that O
might O
end O
in O
revelations. O
So O
he O
stepped O
ashore O
and O
entered O
the O
woods. O
He O
sat O
down O
and O
took O
a O
long O
rest, O
torturing O
himself O
meanwhile O
to O
keep O
awake, O
and O
then O
started O
warily O
down O
the O
home-stretch. O
The O
night O
was O
far O
spent. O
It O
was O
broad O
daylight O
before O
he O
found O
himself O
fairly O
abreast O
the O
island O
bar. O
He O
rested O
again O
until O
the O
sun O
was O
well O
up O
and O
gilding O
the O
great O
river O
with O
its O
splendor, O
and O
then O
he O
plunged O
into O
the O
stream. O
A O
little O
later O
he O
paused, O
dripping, O
upon O
the O
threshold O
of O
the O
camp, O
and O
heard O
Joe Entity
say: Cue
"No, Quotation
Tom's Quotation
true-blue, Quotation
Huck, Quotation
and Quotation
he'll Quotation
come Quotation
back. Quotation
He Quotation
won't Quotation
desert. Quotation
He Quotation
knows Quotation
that Quotation
would Quotation
be Quotation
a Quotation
disgrace Quotation
to Quotation
a Quotation
pirate, Quotation
and Quotation
Tom's Quotation
too Quotation
proud Quotation
for Quotation
that Quotation
sort Quotation
of Quotation
thing. Quotation
He's Quotation
up Quotation
to Quotation
something Quotation
or Quotation
other. Quotation
Now Quotation
I Quotation
wonder Quotation
what?" Quotation
"Well, Quotation
the Quotation
things Quotation
is Quotation
ours, Quotation
anyway, Quotation
ain't Quotation
they?" Quotation
"Pretty Quotation
near, Quotation
but Quotation
not Quotation
yet, Quotation
Huck. Quotation
The Quotation
writing Quotation
says Quotation
they Quotation
are Quotation
if Quotation
he Quotation
ain't Quotation
back Quotation
here Quotation
to Quotation
breakfast." Quotation
"Which Quotation
he Quotation
is!" Quotation
exclaimed Cue
Tom, Entity
with O
fine O
dramatic O
effect, O
stepping O
grandly O
into O
camp. O
A O
sumptuous O
breakfast O
of O
bacon O
and O
fish O
was O
shortly O
provided, O
and O
as O
the O
boys O
set O
to O
work O
upon O
it, O
Tom O
recounted O
(and O
adorned) O
his O
adventures. O
They O
were O
a O
vain O
and O
boastful O
company O
of O
heroes O
when O
the O
tale O
was O
done. O
Then O
Tom O
hid O
himself O
away O
in O
a O
shady O
nook O
to O
sleep O
till O
noon, O
and O
the O
other O
pirates O
got O
ready O
to O
fish O
and O
explore. O
CHAPTER O
XVI O
AFTER O
dinner O
all O
the O
gang O
turned O
out O
to O
hunt O
for O
turtle O
eggs O
on O
the O
bar. O
They O
went O
about O
poking O
sticks O
into O
the O
sand, O
and O
when O
they O
found O
a O
soft O
place O
they O
went O
down O
on O
their O
knees O
and O
dug O
with O
their O
hands. O
Sometimes O
they O
would O
take O
fifty O
or O
sixty O
eggs O
out O
of O
one O
hole. O
They O
were O
perfectly O
round O
white O
things O
a O
trifle O
smaller O
than O
an O
English O
walnut. O
They O
had O
a O
famous O
fried-egg O
feast O
that O
night, O
and O
another O
on O
Friday O
morning. O
After O
breakfast O
they O
went O
whooping O
and O
prancing O
out O
on O
the O
bar, O
and O
chased O
each O
other O
round O
and O
round, O
shedding O
clothes O
as O
they O
went, O
until O
they O
were O
naked, O
and O
then O
continued O
the O
frolic O
far O
away O
up O
the O
shoal O
water O
of O
the O
bar, O
against O
the O
stiff O
current, O
which O
latter O
tripped O
their O
legs O
from O
under O
them O
from O
time O
to O
time O
and O
greatly O
increased O
the O
fun. O
And O
now O
and O
then O
they O
stooped O
in O
a O
group O
and O
splashed O
water O
in O
each O
other's O
faces O
with O
their O
palms, O
gradually O
approaching O
each O
other, O
with O
averted O
faces O
to O
avoid O
the O
strangling O
sprays, O
and O
finally O
gripping O
and O
struggling O
till O
the O
best O
man O
ducked O
his O
neighbor, O
and O
then O
they O
all O
went O
under O
in O
a O
tangle O
of O
white O
legs O
and O
arms O
and O
came O
up O
blowing, O
sputtering, O
laughing, O
and O
gasping O
for O
breath O
at O
one O
and O
the O
same O
time. O
When O
they O
were O
well O
exhausted, O
they O
would O
run O
out O
and O
sprawl O
on O
the O
dry, O
hot O
sand, O
and O
lie O
there O
and O
cover O
themselves O
up O
with O
it, O
and O
by O
and O
by O
break O
for O
the O
water O
again O
and O
go O
through O
the O
original O
performance O
once O
more. O
Finally O
it O
occurred O
to O
them O
that O
their O
naked O
skin O
represented O
flesh-colored O
"tights" O
very O
fairly; O
so O
they O
drew O
a O
ring O
in O
the O
sand O
and O
had O
a O
circus-- O
with O
three O
clowns O
in O
it, O
for O
none O
would O
yield O
this O
proudest O
post O
to O
his O
neighbor. O
Next O
they O
got O
their O
marbles O
and O
played O
"knucks" O
and O
"ring-taw" O
and O
"keeps" O
till O
that O
amusement O
grew O
stale. O
Then O
Joe O
and O
Huck Entity
had O
another O
swim, O
but O
Tom O
would O
not O
venture, O
because O
he O
found O
that O
in O
kicking O
off O
his O
trousers O
he O
had O
kicked O
his O
string O
of O
rattlesnake O
rattles O
off O
his O
ankle, O
and O
he O
wondered O
how O
he O
had O
escaped O
cramp O
so O
long O
without O
the O
protection O
of O
this O
mysterious O
charm. O
He O
did O
not O
venture O
again O
until O
he O
had O
found O
it, O
and O
by O
that O
time O
the O
other O
boys O
were O
tired O
and O
ready O
to O
rest. O
They O
gradually O
wandered O
apart, O
dropped O
into O
the O
"dumps," O
and O
fell O
to O
gazing O
longingly O
across O
the O
wide O
river O
to O
where O
the O
village O
lay O
drowsing O
in O
the O
sun. O
Tom O
found O
himself O
writing O
"BECKY" O
in O
the O
sand O
with O
his O
big O
toe; O
he O
scratched O
it O
out, O
and O
was O
angry O
with O
himself O
for O
his O
weakness. O
But O
he O
wrote O
it O
again, O
nevertheless; O
he O
could O
not O
help O
it. O
He O
erased O
it O
once O
more O
and O
then O
took O
himself O
out O
of O
temptation O
by O
driving O
the O
other O
boys O
together O
and O
joining O
them. O
But O
Joe's Entity
spirits O
had O
gone O
down O
almost O
beyond O
resurrection. O
He O
was O
so O
homesick O
that O
he O
could O
hardly O
endure O
the O
misery O
of O
it. O
The O
tears O
lay O
very O
near O
the O
surface. O
Huck Entity
was O
melancholy, O
too. O
Tom O
was O
downhearted, O
but O
tried O
hard O
not O
to O
show O
it. O
He O
had O
a O
secret O
which O
he O
was O
not O
ready O
to O
tell, O
yet, O
but O
if O
this O
mutinous O
depression O
was O
not O
broken O
up O
soon, O
he O
would O
have O
to O
bring O
it O
out. O
He Entity
said, Cue
with O
a O
great O
show O
of O
cheerfulness: O
"I Quotation
bet Quotation
there's Quotation
been Quotation
pirates Quotation
on Quotation
this Quotation
island Quotation
before, Quotation
boys. Quotation
We'll Quotation
explore Quotation
it Quotation
again. Quotation
They've Quotation
hid Quotation
treasures Quotation
here Quotation
somewhere. Quotation
How'd Quotation
you Quotation
feel Quotation
to Quotation
light Quotation
on Quotation
a Quotation
rotten Quotation
chest Quotation
full Quotation
of Quotation
gold Quotation
and Quotation
silver-- Quotation
hey?" Quotation
But O
it O
roused O
only O
faint O
enthusiasm, O
which O
faded O
out, O
with O
no O
reply. O
Tom O
tried O
one O
or O
two O
other O
seductions; O
but O
they O
failed, O
too. O
It O
was O
discouraging O
work. O
Joe O
sat O
poking O
up O
the O
sand O
with O
a O
stick O
and O
looking O
very O
gloomy. O
Finally O
he Entity
said: Cue
"Oh, Quotation
boys, Quotation
let's Quotation
give Quotation
it Quotation
up. Quotation
I Quotation
want Quotation
to Quotation
go Quotation
home. Quotation
It's Quotation
so Quotation
lonesome." Quotation
"Oh Quotation
no, Quotation
Joe, Quotation
you'll Quotation
feel Quotation
better Quotation
by Quotation
and Quotation
by," Quotation
said Cue
Tom. Entity
"Just Quotation
think Quotation
of Quotation
the Quotation
fishing Quotation
that's Quotation
here." Quotation
"I Quotation
don't Quotation
care Quotation
for Quotation
fishing. Quotation
I Quotation
want Quotation
to Quotation
go Quotation
home." Quotation
"But, Quotation
Joe, Quotation
there Quotation
ain't Quotation
such Quotation
another Quotation
swimming-place Quotation
anywhere." Quotation
"Swimming's Quotation
no Quotation
good. Quotation
I Quotation
don't Quotation
seem Quotation
to Quotation
care Quotation
for Quotation
it, Quotation
somehow, Quotation
when Quotation
there Quotation
ain't Quotation
anybody Quotation
to Quotation
say Quotation
I Quotation
sha'n't Quotation
go Quotation
in. Quotation
I Quotation
mean Quotation
to Quotation
go Quotation
home." Quotation
"Oh, Quotation
shucks! Quotation
Baby! Quotation
You Quotation
want Quotation
to Quotation
see Quotation
your Quotation
mother, Quotation
I Quotation
reckon." Quotation
"Yes, Quotation
I Quotation
DO Quotation
want Quotation
to Quotation
see Quotation
my Quotation
mother-- Quotation
and Quotation
you Quotation
would, Quotation
too, Quotation
if Quotation
you Quotation
had Quotation
one. Quotation
I Quotation
ain't Quotation
any Quotation
more Quotation
baby Quotation
than Quotation
you Quotation
are." Quotation
And O
Joe Entity
snuffled O
a O
little. O
"Well, Quotation
we'll Quotation
let Quotation
the Quotation
cry-baby Quotation
go Quotation
home Quotation
to Quotation
his Quotation
mother, Quotation
won't Quotation
we, Quotation
Huck? Quotation
Poor Quotation
thing-- Quotation
does Quotation
it Quotation
want Quotation
to Quotation
see Quotation
its Quotation
mother? Quotation
And Quotation
so Quotation
it Quotation
shall. Quotation
You Quotation
like Quotation
it Quotation
here, Quotation
don't Quotation
you, Quotation
Huck? Quotation
We'll Quotation
stay, Quotation
won't Quotation
we?" Quotation
Huck Entity
said, Cue
"Y-e-s"-- Quotation
without O
any O
heart O
in O
it. O
"I'll Quotation
never Quotation
speak Quotation
to Quotation
you Quotation
again Quotation
as Quotation
long Quotation
as Quotation
I Quotation
live," Quotation
said Cue
Joe, Entity
rising. O
"There Quotation
now!" Quotation
And O
he O
moved O
moodily O
away O
and O
began O
to O
dress O
himself. O
"Who Quotation
cares!" Quotation
said Cue
Tom. Entity
"Nobody Quotation
wants Quotation
you Quotation
to. Quotation
Go Quotation
'long Quotation
home Quotation
and Quotation
get Quotation
laughed Quotation
at. Quotation
Oh, Quotation
you're Quotation
a Quotation
nice Quotation
pirate. Quotation
Huck Quotation
and Quotation
me Quotation
ain't Quotation
cry-babies. Quotation
We'll Quotation
stay, Quotation
won't Quotation
we, Quotation
Huck? Quotation
Let Quotation
him Quotation
go Quotation
if Quotation
he Quotation
wants Quotation
to. Quotation
I Quotation
reckon Quotation
we Quotation
can Quotation
get Quotation
along Quotation
without Quotation
him, Quotation
per'aps." Quotation
But O
Tom O
was O
uneasy, O
nevertheless, O
and O
was O
alarmed O
to O
see O
Joe O
go O
sullenly O
on O
with O
his O
dressing. O
And O
then O
it O
was O
discomforting O
to O
see O
Huck O
eying O
Joe's O
preparations O
so O
wistfully, O
and O
keeping O
up O
such O
an O
ominous O
silence. O
Presently, O
without O
a O
parting O
word, O
Joe O
began O
to O
wade O
off O
toward O
the O
Illinois O
shore. O
Tom's Entity
heart O
began O
to O
sink. O
He O
glanced O
at O
Huck. O
Huck O
could O
not O
bear O
the O
look, O
and O
dropped O
his O
eyes. O
Then O
he Entity
said: Cue
"I Quotation
want Quotation
to Quotation
go, Quotation
too, Quotation
Tom. Quotation
It Quotation
was Quotation
getting Quotation
so Quotation
lonesome Quotation
anyway, Quotation
and Quotation
now Quotation
it'll Quotation
be Quotation
worse. Quotation
Let's Quotation
us Quotation
go, Quotation
too, Quotation
Tom." Quotation
"I Quotation
won't! Quotation
You Quotation
can Quotation
all Quotation
go, Quotation
if Quotation
you Quotation
want Quotation
to. Quotation
I Quotation
mean Quotation
to Quotation
stay." Quotation
"Tom, Quotation
I Quotation
better Quotation
go." Quotation
"Well, Quotation
go Quotation
'long-- Quotation
who's Quotation
hendering Quotation
you." Quotation
Huck O
began O
to O
pick O
up O
his O
scattered O
clothes. O
He Entity
said: Cue
"Tom, Quotation
I Quotation
wisht Quotation
you'd Quotation
come, Quotation
too. Quotation
Now Quotation
you Quotation
think Quotation
it Quotation
over. Quotation
We'll Quotation
wait Quotation
for Quotation
you Quotation
when Quotation
we Quotation
get Quotation
to Quotation
shore." Quotation
"Well, Quotation
you'll Quotation
wait Quotation
a Quotation
blame Quotation
long Quotation
time, Quotation
that's Quotation
all." Quotation
Huck O
started O
sorrowfully O
away, O
and O
Tom O
stood O
looking O
after O
him, O
with O
a O
strong O
desire O
tugging O
at O
his O
heart O
to O
yield O
his O
pride O
and O
go O
along O
too. O
He O
hoped O
the O
boys O
would O
stop, O
but O
they O
still O
waded O
slowly O
on. O
It O
suddenly O
dawned O
on O
Tom O
that O
it O
was O
become O
very O
lonely O
and O
still. O
He Entity
made O
one O
final O
struggle O
with O
his O
pride, O
and O
then O
darted O
after O
his Entity
comrades, Entity
yelling: Cue
"Wait! Quotation
Wait! Quotation
I Quotation
want Quotation
to Quotation
tell Quotation
you Quotation
something!" Quotation
They O
presently O
stopped O
and O
turned O
around. O
When O
he O
got O
to O
where O
they O
were, O
he O
began O
unfolding O
his O
secret, O
and O
they O
listened O
moodily O
till O
at O
last O
they O
saw O
the O
"point" O
he O
was O
driving O
at, O
and O
then O
they O
set O
up O
a O
war-whoop O
of O
applause O
and O
said O
it O
was O
"splendid!" O
and O
said O
if O
he O
had O
told O
them O
at O
first, O
they O
wouldn't O
have O
started O
away. O
He O
made O
a O
plausible O
excuse; O
but O
his O
real O
reason O
had O
been O
the O
fear O
that O
not O
even O
the O
secret O
would O
keep O
them O
with O
him O
any O
very O
great O
length O
of O
time, O
and O
so O
he O
had O
meant O
to O
hold O
it O
in O
reserve O
as O
a O
last O
seduction. O
The O
lads O
came O
gayly O
back O
and O
went O
at O
their O
sports O
again O
with O
a O
will, O
chattering O
all O
the O
time O
about O
Tom's O
stupendous O
plan O
and O
admiring O
the O
genius O
of O
it. O
After O
a O
dainty O
egg O
and O
fish O
dinner, O
Tom O
said O
he O
wanted O
to O
learn O
to O
smoke, O
now. O
Joe O
caught O
at O
the O
idea O
and O
said O
he O
would O
like O
to O
try, O
too. O
So O
Huck O
made O
pipes O
and O
filled O
them. O
These O
novices O
had O
never O
smoked O
anything O
before O
but O
cigars O
made O
of O
grape-vine, O
and O
they O
"bit" O
the O
tongue, O
and O
were O
not O
considered O
manly O
anyway. O
Now O
they O
stretched O
themselves O
out O
on O
their O
elbows O
and O
began O
to O
puff, O
charily, O
and O
with O
slender O
confidence. O
The O
smoke O
had O
an O
unpleasant O
taste, O
and O
they Entity
gagged O
a O
little, O
but O
Tom Entity
said: Cue
"Why, Quotation
it's Quotation
just Quotation
as Quotation
easy! Quotation
If Quotation
I'd Quotation
a Quotation
knowed Quotation
this Quotation
was Quotation
all, Quotation
I'd Quotation
a Quotation
learnt Quotation
long Quotation
ago." Quotation
"So Quotation
would Quotation
I," Quotation
said Cue
Joe. Entity
"It's Quotation
just Quotation
nothing." Quotation
"Why, Quotation
many Quotation
a Quotation
time Quotation
I've Quotation
looked Quotation
at Quotation
people Quotation
smoking, Quotation
and Quotation
thought Quotation
well Quotation
I Quotation
wish Quotation
I Quotation
could Quotation
do Quotation
that; Quotation
but Quotation
I Quotation
never Quotation
thought Quotation
I Quotation
could," Quotation
said Cue
Tom. Entity
"That's Quotation
just Quotation
the Quotation
way Quotation
with Quotation
me, Quotation
hain't Quotation
it, Quotation
Huck? Quotation
You've Quotation
heard Quotation
me Quotation
talk Quotation
just Quotation
that Quotation
way-- Quotation
haven't Quotation
you, Quotation
Huck? Quotation
I'll Quotation
leave Quotation
it Quotation
to Quotation
Huck Quotation
if Quotation
I Quotation
haven't." Quotation
"Yes-- Quotation
heaps Quotation
of Quotation
times," Quotation
said Cue
Huck. Entity
"Well, Quotation
I Quotation
have Quotation
too," Quotation
said Cue
Tom; Entity
"oh, Quotation
hundreds Quotation
of Quotation
times. Quotation
Once Quotation
down Quotation
by Quotation
the Quotation
slaughter-house. Quotation
Don't Quotation
you Quotation
remember, Quotation
Huck? Quotation
Bob Quotation
Tanner Quotation
was Quotation
there, Quotation
and Quotation
Johnny Quotation
Miller, Quotation
and Quotation
Jeff Quotation
Thatcher, Quotation
when Quotation
I Quotation
said Quotation
it. Quotation
Don't Quotation
you Quotation
remember, Quotation
Huck, Quotation
'bout Quotation
me Quotation
saying Quotation
that?" Quotation
"Yes, Quotation
that's Quotation
so," Quotation
said Cue
Huck. Entity
"That Quotation
was Quotation
the Quotation
day Quotation
after Quotation
I Quotation
lost Quotation
a Quotation
white Quotation
alley. Quotation
No, Quotation
'twas Quotation
the Quotation
day Quotation
before." Quotation
"There Quotation
-- Quotation
I Quotation
told Quotation
you Quotation
so," Quotation
said Cue
Tom. Entity
"Huck Quotation
recollects Quotation
it." Quotation
"I Quotation
bleeve Quotation
I Quotation
could Quotation
smoke Quotation
this Quotation
pipe Quotation
all Quotation
day," Quotation
said Cue
Joe. Entity
"I Quotation
don't Quotation
feel Quotation
sick." Quotation
"Neither Quotation
do Quotation
I," Quotation
said Cue
Tom. Entity
"I Quotation
could Quotation
smoke Quotation
it Quotation
all Quotation
day. Quotation
But Quotation
I Quotation
bet Quotation
you Quotation
Jeff Quotation
Thatcher Quotation
couldn't." Quotation
"Jeff Quotation
Thatcher! Quotation
Why, Quotation
he'd Quotation
keel Quotation
over Quotation
just Quotation
with Quotation
two Quotation
draws. Quotation
Just Quotation
let Quotation
him Quotation
try Quotation
it Quotation
once. Quotation
HE'D Quotation
see!" Quotation
"I Quotation
bet Quotation
he Quotation
would. Quotation
And Quotation
Johnny Quotation
Miller Quotation
-- Quotation
I Quotation
wish Quotation
could Quotation
see Quotation
Johnny Quotation
Miller Quotation
tackle Quotation
it Quotation
once." Quotation
"Oh, Quotation
don't Quotation
I!" Quotation
said Cue
Joe. Entity
"Why, Quotation
I Quotation
bet Quotation
you Quotation
Johnny Quotation
Miller Quotation
couldn't Quotation
any Quotation
more Quotation
do Quotation
this Quotation
than Quotation
nothing. Quotation
Just Quotation
one Quotation
little Quotation
snifter Quotation
would Quotation
fetch Quotation
HIM." Quotation
"'Deed Quotation
it Quotation
would, Quotation
Joe. Quotation
Say Quotation
-- Quotation
I Quotation
wish Quotation
the Quotation
boys Quotation
could Quotation
see Quotation
us Quotation
now." Quotation
"So Quotation
do Quotation
I." Quotation
"Say-- Quotation
boys, Quotation
don't Quotation
say Quotation
anything Quotation
about Quotation
it, Quotation
and Quotation
some Quotation
time Quotation
when Quotation
they're Quotation
around, Quotation
I'll Quotation
come Quotation
up Quotation
to Quotation
you Quotation
and Quotation
say, Quotation
'Joe, Quotation
got Quotation
a Quotation
pipe? Quotation
I Quotation
want Quotation
a Quotation
smoke.' Quotation
And Quotation
you'll Quotation
say, Quotation
kind Quotation
of Quotation
careless Quotation
like, Quotation
as Quotation
if Quotation
it Quotation
warn't Quotation
anything, Quotation
you'll Quotation
say, Quotation
'Yes, Quotation
I Quotation
got Quotation
my Quotation
OLD Quotation
pipe, Quotation
and Quotation
another Quotation
one, Quotation
but Quotation
my Quotation
tobacker Quotation
ain't Quotation
very Quotation
good.' Quotation
And Quotation
I'll Quotation
say, Quotation
'Oh, Quotation
that's Quotation
all Quotation
right, Quotation
if Quotation
it's Quotation
STRONG Quotation
enough.' Quotation
And Quotation
then Quotation
you'll Quotation
out Quotation
with Quotation
the Quotation
pipes, Quotation
and Quotation
we'll Quotation
light Quotation
up Quotation
just Quotation
as Quotation
ca'm, Quotation
and Quotation
then Quotation
just Quotation
see Quotation
'em Quotation
look!" Quotation
"By Quotation
jings, Quotation
that'll Quotation
be Quotation
gay, Quotation
Tom! Quotation
I Quotation
wish Quotation
it Quotation
was Quotation
NOW!" Quotation
"So Quotation
do Quotation
I! Quotation
And Quotation
when Quotation
we Quotation
tell Quotation
'em Quotation
we Quotation
learned Quotation
when Quotation
we Quotation
was Quotation
off Quotation
pirating, Quotation
won't Quotation
they Quotation
wish Quotation
they'd Quotation
been Quotation
along?" Quotation
"Oh, Quotation
I Quotation
reckon Quotation
not! Quotation
I'll Quotation
just Quotation
BET Quotation
they Quotation
will!" Quotation
So O
the O
talk O
ran O
on. O
But O
presently O
it O
began O
to O
flag O
a O
trifle, O
and O
grow O
disjointed. O
The O
silences O
widened; O
the O
expectoration O
marvellously O
increased. O
Every O
pore O
inside O
the O
boys' O
cheeks O
became O
a O
spouting O
fountain; O
they O
could O
scarcely O
bail O
out O
the O
cellars O
under O
their O
tongues O
fast O
enough O
to O
prevent O
an O
inundation; O
little O
overflowings O
down O
their O
throats O
occurred O
in O
spite O
of O
all O
they O
could O
do, O
and O
sudden O
retchings O
followed O
every O
time. O
Both O
boys O
were O
looking O
very O
pale O
and O
miserable, O
now. O
Joe's O
pipe O
dropped O
from O
his O
nerveless O
fingers. O
Tom's O
followed. O
Both O
fountains O
were O
going O
furiously O
and O
both O
pumps O
bailing O
with O
might O
and O
main. O
Joe Entity
said Cue
feebly: O
"I've Quotation
lost Quotation
my Quotation
knife. Quotation
I Quotation
reckon Quotation
I Quotation
better Quotation
go Quotation
and Quotation
find Quotation
it." Quotation
Tom Entity
said, Cue
with O
quivering O
lips O
and O
halting O
utterance: O
"I'll Quotation
help Quotation
you. Quotation
You Quotation
go Quotation
over Quotation
that Quotation
way Quotation
and Quotation
I'll Quotation
hunt Quotation
around Quotation
by Quotation
the Quotation
spring. Quotation
No, Quotation
you Quotation
needn't Quotation
come, Quotation
Huck-- Quotation
we Quotation
can Quotation
find Quotation
it." Quotation
So O
Huck Entity
sat O
down O
again, O
and O
waited O
an O
hour. O
Then O
he O
found O
it O
lonesome, O
and O
went O
to O
find O
his O
comrades. O
They O
were O
wide O
apart O
in O
the O
woods, O
both O
very O
pale, O
both O
fast O
asleep. O
But O
something O
informed O
him O
that O
if O
they O
had O
had O
any O
trouble O
they O
had O
got O
rid O
of O
it. O
They O
were O
not O
talkative O
at O
supper O
that O
night. O
They O
had O
a O
humble O
look, O
and O
when O
Huck Entity
prepared O
his O
pipe O
after O
the O
meal O
and O
was O
going O
to O
prepare O
theirs, O
they Entity
said Cue
no, Quotation
they Quotation
were Quotation
not Quotation
feeling Quotation
very Quotation
well-- Quotation
something Quotation
they Quotation
ate Quotation
at Quotation
dinner Quotation
had Quotation
disagreed Quotation
with Quotation
them. Quotation
About O
midnight O
Joe O
awoke, O
and O
called O
the O
boys. O
There O
was O
a O
brooding O
oppressiveness O
in O
the O
air O
that O
seemed O
to O
bode O
something. O
The O
boys O
huddled O
themselves O
together O
and O
sought O
the O
friendly O
companionship O
of O
the O
fire, O
though O
the O
dull O
dead O
heat O
of O
the O
breathless O
atmosphere O
was O
stifling. O
They O
sat O
still, O
intent O
and O
waiting. O
The O
solemn O
hush O
continued. O
Beyond O
the O
light O
of O
the O
fire O
everything O
was O
swallowed O
up O
in O
the O
blackness O
of O
darkness. O
Presently O
there O
came O
a O
quivering O
glow O
that O
vaguely O
revealed O
the O
foliage O
for O
a O
moment O
and O
then O
vanished. O
By O
and O
by O
another O
came, O
a O
little O
stronger. O
Then O
another. O
Then O
a O
faint O
moan O
came O
sighing O
through O
the O
branches O
of O
the O
forest O
and O
the O
boys O
felt O
a O
fleeting O
breath O
upon O
their O
cheeks, O
and O
shuddered O
with O
the O
fancy O
that O
the O
Spirit O
of O
the O
Night O
had O
gone O
by. O
There O
was O
a O
pause. O
Now O
a O
weird O
flash O
turned O
night O
into O
day O
and O
showed O
every O
little O
grass-blade, O
separate O
and O
distinct, O
that O
grew O
about O
their O
feet. O
And O
it O
showed O
three O
white, O
startled O
faces, O
too. O
A O
deep O
peal O
of O
thunder O
went O
rolling O
and O
tumbling O
down O
the O
heavens O
and O
lost O
itself O
in O
sullen O
rumblings O
in O
the O
distance. O
A O
sweep O
of O
chilly O
air O
passed O
by, O
rustling O
all O
the O
leaves O
and O
snowing O
the O
flaky O
ashes O
broadcast O
about O
the O
fire. O
Another O
fierce O
glare O
lit O
up O
the O
forest O
and O
an O
instant O
crash O
followed O
that O
seemed O
to O
rend O
the O
tree-tops O
right O
over O
the O
boys' O
heads. O
They O
clung O
together O
in O
terror, O
in O
the O
thick O
gloom O
that O
followed. O
A O
few O
big O
rain-drops O
fell O
pattering O
upon O
the O
leaves. O
"Quick! Quotation
boys, Quotation
go Quotation
for Quotation
the Quotation
tent!" Quotation
exclaimed Cue
Tom. Entity
They Entity
sprang O
away, O
stumbling O
over O
roots O
and O
among O
vines O
in O
the O
dark, O
no O
two O
plunging O
in O
the O
same O
direction. O
A O
furious O
blast O
roared O
through O
the O
trees, O
making O
everything O
sing O
as O
it O
went. O
One O
blinding O
flash O
after O
another O
came, O
and O
peal O
on O
peal O
of O
deafening O
thunder. O
And O
now O
a O
drenching O
rain O
poured O
down O
and O
the O
rising O
hurricane O
drove O
it O
in O
sheets O
along O
the O
ground. O
The O
boys O
cried O
out O
to O
each O
other, O
but O
the O
roaring O
wind O
and O
the O
booming O
thunder-blasts O
drowned O
their O
voices O
utterly. O
However, O
one O
by O
one O
they O
straggled O
in O
at O
last O
and O
took O
shelter O
under O
the O
tent, O
cold, O
scared, O
and O
streaming O
with O
water; O
but O
to O
have O
company O
in O
misery O
seemed O
something O
to O
be O
grateful O
for. O
They O
could O
not O
talk, O
the O
old O
sail O
flapped O
so O
furiously, O
even O
if O
the O
other O
noises O
would O
have O
allowed O
them. O
The O
tempest O
rose O
higher O
and O
higher, O
and O
presently O
the O
sail O
tore O
loose O
from O
its O
fastenings O
and O
went O
winging O
away O
on O
the O
blast. O
The O
boys O
seized O
each O
others' O
hands O
and O
fled, O
with O
many O
tumblings O
and O
bruises, O
to O
the O
shelter O
of O
a O
great O
oak O
that O
stood O
upon O
the O
river-bank. O
Now O
the O
battle O
was O
at O
its O
highest. O
Under O
the O
ceaseless O
conflagration O
of O
lightning O
that O
flamed O
in O
the O
skies, O
everything O
below O
stood O
out O
in O
clean-cut O
and O
shadowless O
distinctness: O
the O
bending O
trees, O
the O
billowy O
river, O
white O
with O
foam, O
the O
driving O
spray O
of O
spume-flakes, O
the O
dim O
outlines O
of O
the O
high O
bluffs O
on O
the O
other O
side, O
glimpsed O
through O
the O
drifting O
cloud-rack O
and O
the O
slanting O
veil O
of O
rain. O
Every O
little O
while O
some O
giant O
tree O
yielded O
the O
fight O
and O
fell O
crashing O
through O
the O
younger O
growth; O
and O
the O
unflagging O
thunder-peals O
came O
now O
in O
ear-splitting O
explosive O
bursts, O
keen O
and O
sharp, O
and O
unspeakably O
appalling. O
The O
storm O
culminated O
in O
one O
matchless O
effort O
that O
seemed O
likely O
to O
tear O
the O
island O
to O
pieces, O
burn O
it O
up, O
drown O
it O
to O
the O
tree-tops, O
blow O
it O
away, O
and O
deafen O
every O
creature O
in O
it, O
all O
at O
one O
and O
the O
same O
moment. O
It O
was O
a O
wild O
night O
for O
homeless O
young O
heads O
to O
be O
out O
in. O
But O
at O
last O
the O
battle O
was O
done, O
and O
the O
forces O
retired O
with O
weaker O
and O
weaker O
threatenings O
and O
grumblings, O
and O
peace O
resumed O
her O
sway. O
The O
boys O
went O
back O
to O
camp, O
a O
good O
deal O
awed; O
but O
they O
found O
there O
was O
still O
something O
to O
be O
thankful O
for, O
because O
the O
great O
sycamore, O
the O
shelter O
of O
their O
beds, O
was O
a O
ruin, O
now, O
blasted O
by O
the O
lightnings, O
and O
they O
were O
not O
under O
it O
when O
the O
catastrophe O
happened. O
Everything O
in O
camp O
was O
drenched, O
the O
camp-fire O
as O
well; O
for O
they O
were O
but O
heedless O
lads, O
like O
their O
generation, O
and O
had O
made O
no O
provision O
against O
rain. O
Here O
was O
matter O
for O
dismay, O
for O
they O
were O
soaked O
through O
and O
chilled. O
They O
were O
eloquent O
in O
their O
distress; O
but O
they O
presently O
discovered O
that O
the O
fire O
had O
eaten O
so O
far O
up O
under O
the O
great O
log O
it O
had O
been O
built O
against O
(where O
it O
curved O
upward O
and O
separated O
itself O
from O
the O
ground), O
that O
a O
handbreadth O
or O
so O
of O
it O
had O
escaped O
wetting; O
so O
they O
patiently O
wrought O
until, O
with O
shreds O
and O
bark O
gathered O
from O
the O
under O
sides O
of O
sheltered O
logs, O
they O
coaxed O
the O
fire O
to O
burn O
again. O
Then O
they O
piled O
on O
great O
dead O
boughs O
till O
they O
had O
a O
roaring O
furnace, O
and O
were O
glad-hearted O
once O
more. O
They O
dried O
their O
boiled O
ham O
and O
had O
a O
feast, O
and O
after O
that O
they O
sat O
by O
the O
fire O
and O
expanded O
and O
glorified O
their O
midnight O
adventure O
until O
morning, O
for O
there O
was O
not O
a O
dry O
spot O
to O
sleep O
on, O
anywhere O
around. O
As O
the O
sun O
began O
to O
steal O
in O
upon O
the O
boys, O
drowsiness O
came O
over O
them, O
and O
they O
went O
out O
on O
the O
sandbar O
and O
lay O
down O
to O
sleep. O
They O
got O
scorched O
out O
by O
and O
by, O
and O
drearily O
set O
about O
getting O
breakfast. O
After O
the O
meal O
they O
felt O
rusty, O
and O
stiff-jointed, O
and O
a O
little O
homesick O
once O
more. O
Tom O
saw O
the O
signs, O
and O
fell O
to O
cheering O
up O
the O
pirates O
as O
well O
as O
he O
could. O
But O
they O
cared O
nothing O
for O
marbles, O
or O
circus, O
or O
swimming, O
or O
anything. O
He O
reminded O
them O
of O
the O
imposing O
secret, O
and O
raised O
a O
ray O
of O
cheer. O
While O
it O
lasted, O
he O
got O
them O
interested O
in O
a O
new O
device. O
This O
was O
to O
knock O
off O
being O
pirates, O
for O
a O
while, O
and O
be O
Indians O
for O
a O
change. O
They O
were O
attracted O
by O
this O
idea; O
so O
it O
was O
not O
long O
before O
they O
were O
stripped, O
and O
striped O
from O
head O
to O
heel O
with O
black O
mud, O
like O
so O
many O
zebras-- O
all O
of O
them O
chiefs, O
of O
course-- O
and O
then O
they O
went O
tearing O
through O
the O
woods O
to O
attack O
an O
English O
settlement. O
By O
and O
by O
they O
separated O
into O
three O
hostile O
tribes, O
and O
darted O
upon O
each O
other O
from O
ambush O
with O
dreadful O
war-whoops, O
and O
killed O
and O
scalped O
each O
other O
by O
thousands. O
It O
was O
a O
gory O
day. O
Consequently O
it O
was O
an O
extremely O
satisfactory O
one. O
They O
assembled O
in O
camp O
toward O
supper-time, O
hungry O
and O
happy; O
but O
now O
a O
difficulty O
arose-- O
hostile O
Indians O
could O
not O
break O
the O
bread O
of O
hospitality O
together O
without O
first O
making O
peace, O
and O
this O
was O
a O
simple O
impossibility O
without O
smoking O
a O
pipe O
of O
peace. O
There O
was O
no O
other O
process O
that O
ever O
they O
had O
heard O
of. O
Two O
of O
the O
savages O
almost O
wished O
they O
had O
remained O
pirates. O
However, O
there O
was O
no O
other O
way; O
so O
with O
such O
show O
of O
cheerfulness O
as O
they O
could O
muster O
they O
called O
for O
the O
pipe O
and O
took O
their O
whiff O
as O
it O
passed, O
in O
due O
form. O
And O
behold, O
they O
were O
glad O
they O
had O
gone O
into O
savagery, O
for O
they O
had O
gained O
something; O
they O
found O
that O
they O
could O
now O
smoke O
a O
little O
without O
having O
to O
go O
and O
hunt O
for O
a O
lost O
knife; O
they O
did O
not O
get O
sick O
enough O
to O
be O
seriously O
uncomfortable. O
They O
were O
not O
likely O
to O
fool O
away O
this O
high O
promise O
for O
lack O
of O
effort. O
No, O
they O
practised O
cautiously, O
after O
supper, O
with O
right O
fair O
success, O
and O
so O
they O
spent O
a O
jubilant O
evening. O
They O
were O
prouder O
and O
happier O
in O
their O
new O
acquirement O
than O
they O
would O
have O
been O
in O
the O
scalping O
and O
skinning O
of O
the O
Six O
Nations. O
We O
will O
leave O
them O
to O
smoke O
and O
chatter O
and O
brag, O
since O
we O
have O
no O
further O
use O
for O
them O
at O
present. O
CHAPTER O
XVII O
BUT O
there O
was O
no O
hilarity O
in O
the O
little O
town O
that O
same O
tranquil O
Saturday O
afternoon. O
The O
Harpers, O
and O
Aunt O
Polly's O
family, O
were O
being O
put O
into O
mourning, O
with O
great O
grief O
and O
many O
tears. O
An O
unusual O
quiet O
possessed O
the O
village, O
although O
it O
was O
ordinarily O
quiet O
enough, O
in O
all O
conscience. O
The O
villagers O
conducted O
their O
concerns O
with O
an O
absent O
air, O
and O
talked O
little; O
but O
they O
sighed O
often. O
The O
Saturday O
holiday O
seemed O
a O
burden O
to O
the O
children. O
They O
had O
no O
heart O
in O
their O
sports, O
and O
gradually O
gave O
them O
up. O
In O
the O
afternoon O
Becky O
Thatcher O
found O
herself O
moping O
about O
the O
deserted O
schoolhouse O
yard, O
and O
feeling O
very O
melancholy. O
But O
she O
found O
nothing O
there O
to O
comfort O
her. O
She Entity
soliloquized: Cue
"Oh, Quotation
if Quotation
I Quotation
only Quotation
had Quotation
a Quotation
brass Quotation
andiron-knob Quotation
again! Quotation
But Quotation
I Quotation
haven't Quotation
got Quotation
anything Quotation
now Quotation
to Quotation
remember Quotation
him Quotation
by." Quotation
And O
she O
choked O
back O
a O
little O
sob. O
Presently O
she Entity
stopped, O
and O
said Cue
to O
herself: Entity
"It Quotation
was Quotation
right Quotation
here. Quotation
Oh, Quotation
if Quotation
it Quotation
was Quotation
to Quotation
do Quotation
over Quotation
again, Quotation
I Quotation
wouldn't Quotation
say Quotation
that Quotation
-- Quotation
I Quotation
wouldn't Quotation
say Quotation
it Quotation
for Quotation
the Quotation
whole Quotation
world. Quotation
But Quotation
he's Quotation
gone Quotation
now; Quotation
I'll Quotation
never, Quotation
never, Quotation
never Quotation
see Quotation
him Quotation
any Quotation
more." Quotation
This O
thought O
broke O
her O
down, O
and O
she O
wandered O
away, O
with O
tears O
rolling O
down O
her O
cheeks. O
Then O
quite O
a O
group O
of O
boys O
and O
girls-- O
playmates O
of O
Tom's O
and O
Joe's-- O
came O
by, O
and O
stood O
looking O
over O
the O
paling O
fence O
and O
talking O
in O
reverent O
tones O
of O
how O
Tom O
did O
so-and-so O
the O
last O
time O
they O
saw O
him, O
and O
how O
Joe O
said O
this O
and O
that O
small O
trifle O
(pregnant O
with O
awful O
prophecy, O
as O
they O
could O
easily O
see O
now!)-- O
and O
each Entity
speaker Entity
pointed Cue
out Cue
the Quotation
exact Quotation
spot Quotation
where Quotation
the Quotation
lost Quotation
lads Quotation
stood Quotation
at Quotation
the Quotation
time, Quotation
and O
then O
added Cue
something O
like O
"and Quotation
I Quotation
was Quotation
a-standing Quotation
just Quotation
so-- Quotation
just Quotation
as Quotation
I Quotation
am Quotation
now, Quotation
and Quotation
as Quotation
if Quotation
you Quotation
was Quotation
him Quotation
-- Quotation
I Quotation
was Quotation
as Quotation
close Quotation
as Quotation
that-- Quotation
and Quotation
he Quotation
smiled, Quotation
just Quotation
this Quotation
way-- Quotation
and Quotation
then Quotation
something Quotation
seemed Quotation
to Quotation
go Quotation
all Quotation
over Quotation
me, Quotation
like-- Quotation
awful, Quotation
you Quotation
know-- Quotation
and Quotation
I Quotation
never Quotation
thought Quotation
what Quotation
it Quotation
meant, Quotation
of Quotation
course, Quotation
but Quotation
I Quotation
can Quotation
see Quotation
now!" Quotation
Then O
there O
was O
a O
dispute O
about O
who O
saw O
the O
dead O
boys O
last O
in O
life, O
and O
many O
claimed O
that O
dismal O
distinction, O
and O
offered O
evidences, O
more O
or O
less O
tampered O
with O
by O
the O
witness; O
and O
when O
it O
was O
ultimately O
decided O
who O
DID O
see O
the O
departed O
last, O
and O
exchanged O
the O
last O
words O
with O
them, O
the O
lucky O
parties O
took O
upon O
themselves O
a O
sort O
of O
sacred O
importance, O
and O
were O
gaped O
at O
and O
envied O
by O
all O
the O
rest. O
One Entity
poor Entity
chap, Entity
who O
had O
no O
other O
grandeur O
to O
offer, O
said Cue
with O
tolerably O
manifest O
pride O
in O
the O
remembrance: O
"Well, Quotation
Tom Quotation
Sawyer Quotation
he Quotation
licked Quotation
me Quotation
once." Quotation
But O
that O
bid O
for O
glory O
was O
a O
failure. O
Most O
of O
the O
boys O
could O
say O
that, O
and O
so O
that O
cheapened O
the O
distinction O
too O
much. O
The O
group O
loitered O
away, O
still O
recalling O
memories O
of O
the O
lost O
heroes, O
in O
awed O
voices. O
When O
the O
Sunday-school O
hour O
was O
finished, O
the O
next O
morning, O
the O
bell O
began O
to O
toll, O
instead O
of O
ringing O
in O
the O
usual O
way. O
It O
was O
a O
very O
still O
Sabbath, O
and O
the O
mournful O
sound O
seemed O
in O
keeping O
with O
the O
musing O
hush O
that O
lay O
upon O
nature. O
The O
villagers O
began O
to O
gather, O
loitering O
a O
moment O
in O
the O
vestibule O
to O
converse O
in O
whispers O
about O
the O
sad O
event. O
But O
there O
was O
no O
whispering O
in O
the O
house; O
only O
the O
funereal O
rustling O
of O
dresses O
as O
the O
women O
gathered O
to O
their O
seats O
disturbed O
the O
silence O
there. O
None O
could O
remember O
when O
the O
little O
church O
had O
been O
so O
full O
before. O
There O
was O
finally O
a O
waiting O
pause, O
an O
expectant O
dumbness, O
and O
then O
Aunt O
Polly O
entered, O
followed O
by O
Sid O
and O
Mary, O
and O
they O
by O
the O
Harper O
family, O
all O
in O
deep O
black, O
and O
the O
whole O
congregation, O
the O
old O
minister O
as O
well, O
rose O
reverently O
and O
stood O
until O
the O
mourners O
were O
seated O
in O
the O
front O
pew. O
There O
was O
another O
communing O
silence, O
broken O
at O
intervals O
by O
muffled O
sobs, O
and O
then O
the O
minister O
spread O
his O
hands O
abroad O
and O
prayed. O
A O
moving O
hymn O
was O
sung, O
and O
the O
text O
followed: O
"I O
am O
the O
Resurrection O
and O
the O
Life." O
As O
the O
service O
proceeded, O
the O
clergyman O
drew O
such O
pictures O
of O
the O
graces, O
the O
winning O
ways, O
and O
the O
rare O
promise O
of O
the O
lost O
lads O
that O
every O
soul O
there, O
thinking O
he O
recognized O
these O
pictures, O
felt O
a O
pang O
in O
remembering O
that O
he O
had O
persistently O
blinded O
himself O
to O
them O
always O
before, O
and O
had O
as O
persistently O
seen O
only O
faults O
and O
flaws O
in O
the O
poor O
boys. O
The O
minister O
related O
many O
a O
touching O
incident O
in O
the O
lives O
of O
the O
departed, O
too, O
which O
illustrated O
their O
sweet, O
generous O
natures, O
and O
the O
people O
could O
easily O
see, O
now, O
how O
noble O
and O
beautiful O
those O
episodes O
were, O
and O
remembered O
with O
grief O
that O
at O
the O
time O
they O
occurred O
they O
had O
seemed O
rank O
rascalities, O
well O
deserving O
of O
the O
cowhide. O
The O
congregation O
became O
more O
and O
more O
moved, O
as O
the O
pathetic O
tale O
went O
on, O
till O
at O
last O
the O
whole O
company O
broke O
down O
and O
joined O
the O
weeping O
mourners O
in O
a O
chorus O
of O
anguished O
sobs, O
the O
preacher O
himself O
giving O
way O
to O
his O
feelings, O
and O
crying O
in O
the O
pulpit. O
There O
was O
a O
rustle O
in O
the O
gallery, O
which O
nobody O
noticed; O
a O
moment O
later O
the O
church O
door O
creaked; O
the O
minister O
raised O
his O
streaming O
eyes O
above O
his O
handkerchief, O
and O
stood O
transfixed! O
First O
one O
and O
then O
another O
pair O
of O
eyes O
followed O
the O
minister's, O
and O
then O
almost O
with O
one O
impulse O
the O
congregation O
rose O
and O
stared O
while O
the O
three O
dead O
boys O
came O
marching O
up O
the O
aisle, O
Tom O
in O
the O
lead, O
Joe O
next, O
and O
Huck, O
a O
ruin O
of O
drooping O
rags, O
sneaking O
sheepishly O
in O
the O
rear! O
They O
had O
been O
hid O
in O
the O
unused O
gallery O
listening O
to O
their O
own O
funeral O
sermon! O
Aunt Entity
Polly, Entity
Mary, O
and O
the O
Harpers O
threw O
themselves O
upon O
their O
restored O
ones, O
smothered O
them O
with O
kisses O
and O
poured O
out O
thanksgivings, O
while O
poor O
Huck O
stood O
abashed O
and O
uncomfortable, O
not O
knowing O
exactly O
what O
to O
do O
or O
where O
to O
hide O
from O
so O
many O
unwelcoming O
eyes. O
He O
wavered, O
and O
started O
to O
slink O
away, O
but O
Tom Entity
seized O
him O
and O
said: Cue
"Aunt Quotation
Polly, Quotation
it Quotation
ain't Quotation
fair. Quotation
Somebody's Quotation
got Quotation
to Quotation
be Quotation
glad Quotation
to Quotation
see Quotation
Huck." Quotation
"And Quotation
so Quotation
they Quotation
shall. Quotation
I'm Quotation
glad Quotation
to Quotation
see Quotation
him, Quotation
poor Quotation
motherless Quotation
thing!" Quotation
And O
the O
loving O
attentions O
Aunt O
Polly O
lavished O
upon O
him O
were O
the O
one O
thing O
capable O
of O
making O
him O
more O
uncomfortable O
than O
he O
was O
before. O
Suddenly O
the Entity
minister Entity
shouted Cue
at O
the O
top O
of O
his O
voice: O
"Praise Quotation
God Quotation
from Quotation
whom Quotation
all Quotation
blessings Quotation
flow-- Quotation
SING!-- Quotation
and Quotation
put Quotation
your Quotation
hearts Quotation
in Quotation
it!" Quotation
And O
they Entity
did. O
Old O
Hundred O
swelled O
up O
with O
a O
triumphant O
burst, O
and O
while O
it O
shook O
the O
rafters O
Tom O
Sawyer O
the O
Pirate O
looked O
around O
upon O
the O
envying O
juveniles O
about O
him O
and O
confessed O
in O
his O
heart O
that O
this O
was O
the O
proudest O
moment O
of O
his O
life. O
As O
the O
"sold" O
congregation O
trooped O
out O
they O
said O
they O
would O
almost O
be O
willing O
to O
be O
made O
ridiculous O
again O
to O
hear O
Old O
Hundred O
sung O
like O
that O
once O
more. O
Tom O
got O
more O
cuffs O
and O
kisses O
that O
day-- O
according O
to O
Aunt O
Polly's O
varying O
moods-- O
than O
he O
had O
earned O
before O
in O
a O
year; O
and O
he O
hardly O
knew O
which O
expressed O
the O
most O
gratefulness O
to O
God O
and O
affection O
for O
himself. O
CHAPTER O
XVIII O
THAT O
was O
Tom's O
great O
secret-- O
the O
scheme O
to O
return O
home O
with O
his O
brother O
pirates O
and O
attend O
their O
own O
funerals. O
They O
had O
paddled O
over O
to O
the O
Missouri O
shore O
on O
a O
log, O
at O
dusk O
on O
Saturday, O
landing O
five O
or O
six O
miles O
below O
the O
village; O
they O
had O
slept O
in O
the O
woods O
at O
the O
edge O
of O
the O
town O
till O
nearly O
daylight, O
and O
had O
then O
crept O
through O
back O
lanes O
and O
alleys O
and O
finished O
their O
sleep O
in O
the O
gallery O
of O
the O
church O
among O
a O
chaos O
of O
invalided O
benches. O
At O
breakfast, O
Monday O
morning, O
Aunt O
Polly O
and O
Mary O
were O
very O
loving O
to O
Tom, Entity
and O
very O
attentive O
to O
his O
wants. O
There O
was O
an O
unusual O
amount O
of O
talk. O
In O
the O
course O
of O
it O
Aunt Entity
Polly Entity
said: Cue
"Well, Quotation
I Quotation
don't Quotation
say Quotation
it Quotation
wasn't Quotation
a Quotation
fine Quotation
joke, Quotation
Tom, Quotation
to Quotation
keep Quotation
everybody Quotation
suffering Quotation
'most Quotation
a Quotation
week Quotation
so Quotation
you Quotation
boys Quotation
had Quotation
a Quotation
good Quotation
time, Quotation
but Quotation
it Quotation
is Quotation
a Quotation
pity Quotation
you Quotation
could Quotation
be Quotation
so Quotation
hard-hearted Quotation
as Quotation
to Quotation
let Quotation
me Quotation
suffer Quotation
so. Quotation
If Quotation
you Quotation
could Quotation
come Quotation
over Quotation
on Quotation
a Quotation
log Quotation
to Quotation
go Quotation
to Quotation
your Quotation
funeral, Quotation
you Quotation
could Quotation
have Quotation
come Quotation
over Quotation
and Quotation
give Quotation
me Quotation
a Quotation
hint Quotation
some Quotation
way Quotation
that Quotation
you Quotation
warn't Quotation
dead, Quotation
but Quotation
only Quotation
run Quotation
off." Quotation
"Yes, Quotation
you Quotation
could Quotation
have Quotation
done Quotation
that, Quotation
Tom," Quotation
said Cue
Mary; Entity
"and Quotation
I Quotation
believe Quotation
you Quotation
would Quotation
if Quotation
you Quotation
had Quotation
thought Quotation
of Quotation
it." Quotation
"Would Quotation
you, Quotation
Tom?" Quotation
said Cue
Aunt Entity
Polly, Entity
her O
face O
lighting O
wistfully. O
"Say, Quotation
now, Quotation
would Quotation
you, Quotation
if Quotation
you'd Quotation
thought Quotation
of Quotation
it?" Quotation
"I-- Quotation
well, Quotation
I Quotation
don't Quotation
know. Quotation
'Twould Quotation
'a' Quotation
spoiled Quotation
everything." Quotation
"Tom, Quotation
I Quotation
hoped Quotation
you Quotation
loved Quotation
me Quotation
that Quotation
much," Quotation
said Cue
Aunt Entity
Polly, Entity
with O
a O
grieved O
tone O
that O
discomforted O
the Entity
boy. Entity
"It Quotation
would Quotation
have Quotation
been Quotation
something Quotation
if Quotation
you'd Quotation
cared Quotation
enough Quotation
to Quotation
THINK Quotation
of Quotation
it, Quotation
even Quotation
if Quotation
you Quotation
didn't Quotation
DO Quotation
it." Quotation
"Now, Quotation
auntie, Quotation
that Quotation
ain't Quotation
any Quotation
harm," Quotation
pleaded Cue
Mary; Entity
"it's Quotation
only Quotation
Tom's Quotation
giddy Quotation
way-- Quotation
he Quotation
is Quotation
always Quotation
in Quotation
such Quotation
a Quotation
rush Quotation
that Quotation
he Quotation
never Quotation
thinks Quotation
of Quotation
anything." Quotation
"More's Quotation
the Quotation
pity. Quotation
Sid Quotation
would Quotation
have Quotation
thought. Quotation
And Quotation
Sid Quotation
would Quotation
have Quotation
come Quotation
and Quotation
DONE Quotation
it, Quotation
too. Quotation
Tom, Quotation
you'll Quotation
look Quotation
back, Quotation
some Quotation
day, Quotation
when Quotation
it's Quotation
too Quotation
late, Quotation
and Quotation
wish Quotation
you'd Quotation
cared Quotation
a Quotation
little Quotation
more Quotation
for Quotation
me Quotation
when Quotation
it Quotation
would Quotation
have Quotation
cost Quotation
you Quotation
so Quotation
little." Quotation
"Now, Quotation
auntie, Quotation
you Quotation
know Quotation
I Quotation
do Quotation
care Quotation
for Quotation
you," Quotation
said Cue
Tom. Entity
"I'd Quotation
know Quotation
it Quotation
better Quotation
if Quotation
you Quotation
acted Quotation
more Quotation
like Quotation
it." Quotation
"I Quotation
wish Quotation
now Quotation
I'd Quotation
thought," Quotation
said Cue
Tom, Entity
with O
a O
repentant O
tone; O
"but Quotation
I Quotation
dreamt Quotation
about Quotation
you, Quotation
anyway. Quotation
That's Quotation
something, Quotation
ain't Quotation
it?" Quotation
"It Quotation
ain't Quotation
much Quotation
-- Quotation
a Quotation
cat Quotation
does Quotation
that Quotation
much-- Quotation
but Quotation
it's Quotation
better Quotation
than Quotation
nothing. Quotation
What Quotation
did Quotation
you Quotation
dream?" Quotation
"Why, Quotation
Wednesday Quotation
night Quotation
I Quotation
dreamt Quotation
that Quotation
you Quotation
was Quotation
sitting Quotation
over Quotation
there Quotation
by Quotation
the Quotation
bed, Quotation
and Quotation
Sid Quotation
was Quotation
sitting Quotation
by Quotation
the Quotation
woodbox, Quotation
and Quotation
Mary Quotation
next Quotation
to Quotation
him." Quotation
"Well, Quotation
so Quotation
we Quotation
did. Quotation
So Quotation
we Quotation
always Quotation
do. Quotation
I'm Quotation
glad Quotation
your Quotation
dreams Quotation
could Quotation
take Quotation
even Quotation
that Quotation
much Quotation
trouble Quotation
about Quotation
us." Quotation
"And Quotation
I Quotation
dreamt Quotation
that Quotation
Joe Quotation
Harper's Quotation
mother Quotation
was Quotation
here." Quotation
"Why, Quotation
she Quotation
was Quotation
here! Quotation
Did Quotation
you Quotation
dream Quotation
any Quotation
more?" Quotation
"Oh, Quotation
lots. Quotation
But Quotation
it's Quotation
so Quotation
dim, Quotation
now." Quotation
"Well, Quotation
try Quotation
to Quotation
recollect-- Quotation
can't Quotation
you?" Quotation
"Somehow Quotation
it Quotation
seems Quotation
to Quotation
me Quotation
that Quotation
the Quotation
wind-- Quotation
the Quotation
wind Quotation
blowed Quotation
the-- Quotation
the Quotation
-- Quotation
" Quotation
"Try Quotation
harder, Quotation
Tom! Quotation
The Quotation
wind Quotation
did Quotation
blow Quotation
something. Quotation
Come!" Quotation
Tom Entity
pressed O
his O
fingers O
on O
his O
forehead O
an O
anxious O
minute, O
and O
then O
said: Cue
"I've Quotation
got Quotation
it Quotation
now! Quotation
I've Quotation
got Quotation
it Quotation
now! Quotation
It Quotation
blowed Quotation
the Quotation
candle!" Quotation
"Mercy Quotation
on Quotation
us! Quotation
Go Quotation
on, Quotation
Tom-- Quotation
go Quotation
on!" Quotation
"And Quotation
it Quotation
seems Quotation
to Quotation
me Quotation
that Quotation
you Quotation
said, Quotation
'Why, Quotation
I Quotation
believe Quotation
that Quotation
that Quotation
door-- Quotation
'" Quotation
"Go Quotation
ON, Quotation
Tom!" Quotation
"Just Quotation
let Quotation
me Quotation
study Quotation
a Quotation
moment-- Quotation
just Quotation
a Quotation
moment. Quotation
Oh, Quotation
yes-- Quotation
you Quotation
said Quotation
you Quotation
believed Quotation
the Quotation
door Quotation
was Quotation
open." Quotation
"As Quotation
I'm Quotation
sitting Quotation
here, Quotation
I Quotation
did! Quotation
Didn't Quotation
I, Quotation
Mary! Quotation
Go Quotation
on!" Quotation
"And Quotation
then-- Quotation
and Quotation
then-- Quotation
well Quotation
I Quotation
won't Quotation
be Quotation
certain, Quotation
but Quotation
it Quotation
seems Quotation
like Quotation
as Quotation
if Quotation
you Quotation
made Quotation
Sid Quotation
go Quotation
and-- Quotation
and Quotation
-- Quotation
" Quotation
"Well? Quotation
Well? Quotation
What Quotation
did Quotation
I Quotation
make Quotation
him Quotation
do, Quotation
Tom? Quotation
What Quotation
did Quotation
I Quotation
make Quotation
him Quotation
do?" Quotation
"You Quotation
made Quotation
him-- Quotation
you-- Quotation
Oh, Quotation
you Quotation
made Quotation
him Quotation
shut Quotation
it." Quotation
"Well, Quotation
for Quotation
the Quotation
land's Quotation
sake! Quotation
I Quotation
never Quotation
heard Quotation
the Quotation
beat Quotation
of Quotation
that Quotation
in Quotation
all Quotation
my Quotation
days! Quotation
Don't Quotation
tell Quotation
ME Quotation
there Quotation
ain't Quotation
anything Quotation
in Quotation
dreams, Quotation
any Quotation
more. Quotation
Sereny Quotation
Harper Quotation
shall Quotation
know Quotation
of Quotation
this Quotation
before Quotation
I'm Quotation
an Quotation
hour Quotation
older. Quotation
I'd Quotation
like Quotation
to Quotation
see Quotation
her Quotation
get Quotation
around Quotation
THIS Quotation
with Quotation
her Quotation
rubbage Quotation
'bout Quotation
superstition. Quotation
Go Quotation
on, Quotation
Tom!" Quotation
"Oh, Quotation
it's Quotation
all Quotation
getting Quotation
just Quotation
as Quotation
bright Quotation
as Quotation
day, Quotation
now. Quotation
Next Quotation
you Quotation
said Quotation
I Quotation
warn't Quotation
BAD, Quotation
only Quotation
mischeevous Quotation
and Quotation
harum-scarum, Quotation
and Quotation
not Quotation
any Quotation
more Quotation
responsible Quotation
than-- Quotation
than Quotation
-- Quotation
I Quotation
think Quotation
it Quotation
was Quotation
a Quotation
colt, Quotation
or Quotation
something." Quotation
"And Quotation
so Quotation
it Quotation
was! Quotation
Well, Quotation
goodness Quotation
gracious! Quotation
Go Quotation
on, Quotation
Tom!" Quotation
"And Quotation
then Quotation
you Quotation
began Quotation
to Quotation
cry." Quotation
"So Quotation
I Quotation
did. Quotation
So Quotation
I Quotation
did. Quotation
Not Quotation
the Quotation
first Quotation
time, Quotation
neither. Quotation
And Quotation
then Quotation
-- Quotation
" Quotation
"Then Quotation
Mrs. Quotation
Harper Quotation
she Quotation
began Quotation
to Quotation
cry, Quotation
and Quotation
said Quotation
Joe Quotation
was Quotation
just Quotation
the Quotation
same, Quotation
and Quotation
she Quotation
wished Quotation
she Quotation
hadn't Quotation
whipped Quotation
him Quotation
for Quotation
taking Quotation
cream Quotation
when Quotation
she'd Quotation
throwed Quotation
it Quotation
out Quotation

" Quotation
"Tom! Quotation
The Quotation
sperrit Quotation
was Quotation
upon Quotation
you! Quotation
You Quotation
was Quotation
a Quotation
prophesying-- Quotation
that's Quotation
what Quotation
you Quotation
was Quotation
doing! Quotation
Land Quotation
alive, Quotation
go Quotation
on, Quotation
Tom!" Quotation
"Then Quotation
Sid Quotation
he Quotation
said-- Quotation
he Quotation
said Quotation

" Quotation
"I Quotation
don't Quotation
think Quotation
I Quotation
said Quotation
anything," Quotation
said Cue
Sid. Entity
"Yes Quotation
you Quotation
did, Quotation
Sid," Quotation
said Cue
Mary. Entity
"Shut Quotation
your Quotation
heads Quotation
and Quotation
let Quotation
Tom Quotation
go Quotation
on! Quotation
What Quotation
did Quotation
he Quotation
say, Quotation
Tom?" Quotation
"He Quotation
said Quotation

I Quotation
THINK Quotation
he Quotation
said Quotation
he Quotation
hoped Quotation
I Quotation
was Quotation
better Quotation
off Quotation
where Quotation
I Quotation
was Quotation
gone Quotation
to, Quotation

if Quotation
I'd Quotation
been Quotation
better Quotation
sometimes Quotation

" Quotation
"THERE, Quotation
d'you Quotation
hear Quotation
that! Quotation
It Quotation
was Quotation
his Quotation
very Quotation
words!" Quotation
"And Quotation
you Quotation
shut Quotation
him Quotation
up Quotation
sharp." Quotation
"I Quotation
lay Quotation
I Quotation
did! Quotation
There Quotation
must Quotation
'a' Quotation

there. Quotation
There Quotation
WAS Quotation
an Quotation
angel Quotation
there, Quotation
somewheres!" Quotation
"And Quotation
Mrs. Quotation
Harper Quotation
told Quotation
about Quotation
Joe Quotation
scaring Quotation
her Quotation
with Quotation
a Quotation
firecracker, Quotation

"Just Quotation
as Quotation
true Quotation
as Quotation
I Quotation

"And Quotation
then Quotation
there Quotation
was Quotation
a Quotation
whole Quotation

of Quotation
talk Quotation
'bout Quotation

the Quotation
river Quotation
for Quotation
us, Quotation

'bout Quotation

Sunday, Quotation

then Quotation
you Quotation

"It Quotation
happened Quotation
just Quotation
so! Quotation
It Quotation
happened Quotation
just Quotation
so, Quotation
as Quotation
sure Quotation
as Quotation
I'm Quotation
a-sitting Quotation
in Quotation
these Quotation
very Quotation
tracks. Quotation
Tom, Quotation
you Quotation
couldn't Quotation

what? Quotation
Go Quotation
on, Quotation
Tom!" Quotation

I Quotation

you Quotation

for Quotation
me-- Quotation

I Quotation
could Quotation

you Quotation

hear Quotation
every Quotation

you Quotation
went Quotation
to Quotation

I Quotation
was Quotation
so Quotation
sorry Quotation

I Quotation
took Quotation

the Quotation
lips." Quotation
"Did Quotation
you, Quotation

DID Quotation
you! Quotation
I Quotation
just Quotation
forgive Quotation
you Quotation
everything Quotation

she Entity

night Quotation
comes. Quotation
Go Quotation
'long Quotation
Sid, Quotation
Mary, Quotation
Tom-- Quotation
take Quotation
yourselves Quotation
off-- Quotation
you've Quotation
hendered Quotation

The O
children O
left O
for O
school, O
and O
the O
old O
lady O
to O
call O
on O
Mrs. O
Harper O
and O
vanquish O
her O
realism O
with O
Tom's O
marvellous O
dream. O
Sid O
had O
better O
judgment O
than O
to O
utter O
the O
thought O
that O
was O
in O
his O
mind O
as O
he O
left O
the O
house. O
It O
was O
this: O
"Pretty O
thin-- O
as O
long O
a O
dream O
as O
that, O
without O
any O
mistakes O
in O
it!" O
What O
a O
hero O
Tom O
was O
become, O
now! O
He O
did O
not O
go O
skipping O
and O
prancing, O
but O
moved O
with O
a O
dignified O
swagger O
as O
became O
a O
pirate O
who O
felt O
that O
the O
public O
eye O
was O
on O
him. O
And O
indeed O
it O
was; O
he O
tried O
not O
to O
seem O
to O
see O
the O
looks O
or O
hear O
the O
remarks O
as O
he O
passed O
along, O
but O
they O
were O
food O
and O
drink O
to O
him. O
Smaller O
boys O
than O
himself O
flocked O
at O
his O
heels, O
as O
proud O
to O
be O
seen O
with O
him, O
and O
tolerated O
by O
him, O
as O
if O
he O
had O
been O
the O
drummer O
at O
the O
head O
of O
a O
procession O
or O
the O
elephant O
leading O
a O
menagerie O
into O
town. O
Boys O
of O
his O
own O
size O
pretended O
not O
to O
know O
he O
had O
been O
away O
at O
all; O
but O
they O
were O
consuming O
with O
envy, O
nevertheless. O
They O
would O
have O
given O
anything O
to O
have O
that O
swarthy O
suntanned O
skin O
of O
his, O
and O
his O
glittering O
notoriety; O
and O
Tom O
would O
not O
have O
parted O
with O
either O
for O
a O
circus. O
At O
school O
the O
children O
made O
so O
much O
of O
him O
and O
of O
Joe, O
and O
delivered O
such O
eloquent O
admiration O
from O
their O
eyes, O
that O
the O
two O
heroes O
were O
not O
long O
in O
becoming O
insufferably O
"stuck-up." O
They O
began O
to O
tell O
their O
adventures O
to O
hungry O
listeners-- O
but O
they O
only O
began; O
it O
was O
not O
a O
thing O
likely O
to O
have O
an O
end, O
with O
imaginations O
like O
theirs O
to O
furnish O
material. O
And O
finally, O
when O
they O
got O
out O
their O
pipes O
and O
went O
serenely O
puffing O
around, O
the O
very O
summit O
of O
glory O
was O
reached. O
Tom O
decided O
that O
he O
could O
be O
independent O
of O
Becky O
Thatcher O
now. O
Glory O
was O
sufficient. O
He O
would O
live O
for O
glory. O
Now O
that O
he O
was O
distinguished, O
maybe O
she O
would O
be O
wanting O
to O
"make O
up." O
Well, O
let O
her-- O
she O
should O
see O
that O
he O
could O
be O
as O
indifferent O
as O
some O
other O
people. O
Presently O
she O
arrived. O
Tom O
pretended O
not O
to O
see O
her. O
He O
moved O
away O
and O
joined O
a O
group O
of O
boys O
and O
girls O
and O
began O
to O
talk. O
Soon O
he O
observed O
that O
she O
was O
tripping O
gayly O
back O
and O
forth O
with O
flushed O
face O
and O
dancing O
eyes, O
pretending O
to O
be O
busy O
chasing O
schoolmates, O
and O
screaming O
with O
laughter O
when O
she O
made O
a O
capture; O
but O
he O
noticed O
that O
she O
always O
made O
her O
captures O
in O
his O
vicinity, O
and O
that O
she O
seemed O
to O
cast O
a O
conscious O
eye O
in O
his O
direction O
at O
such O
times, O
too. O
It O
gratified O
all O
the O
vicious O
vanity O
that O
was O
in O
him; O
and O
so, O
instead O
of O
winning O
him, O
it O
only O
"set O
him O
up" O
the O
more O
and O
made O
him O
the O
more O
diligent O
to O
avoid O
betraying O
that O
he O
knew O
she O
was O
about. O
Presently O
she O
gave O
over O
skylarking, O
and O
moved O
irresolutely O
about, O
sighing O
once O
or O
twice O
and O
glancing O
furtively O
and O
wistfully O
toward O
Tom. O
Then O
she O
observed O
that O
now O
Tom O
was O
talking O
more O
particularly O
to O
Amy O
Lawrence O
than O
to O
any O
one O
else. O
She O
felt O
a O
sharp O
pang O
and O
grew O
disturbed O
and O
uneasy O
at O
once. O
She O
tried O
to O
go O
away, O
but O
her O
feet O
were O
treacherous, O
and O
carried O
her O
to O
the O
group O
instead. O
She Entity
said Cue
to O
a Entity
girl Entity
almost Entity
at Entity
Tom's Entity
elbow-- Entity
with O
sham O
vivacity: O
"Why, Quotation
Mary Quotation
Austin! Quotation
you Quotation
bad Quotation
girl, Quotation
why Quotation
didn't Quotation
you Quotation
come Quotation
to Quotation
Sunday-school?" Quotation
"I Quotation
did Quotation
come-- Quotation
didn't Quotation
you Quotation
see Quotation
me?" Quotation
"Why, Quotation
no! Quotation
Did Quotation
you? Quotation
Where Quotation
did Quotation
you Quotation
sit?" Quotation
"I Quotation
was Quotation
in Quotation
Miss Quotation
Peters' Quotation
class, Quotation
where Quotation
I Quotation
always Quotation
go. Quotation
I Quotation
saw Quotation
YOU." Quotation
"Did Quotation
you? Quotation
Why, Quotation
it's Quotation
funny Quotation
I Quotation
didn't Quotation
see Quotation
you. Quotation
I Quotation
wanted Quotation
to Quotation
tell Quotation
you Quotation
about Quotation
the Quotation
picnic." Quotation
"Oh, Quotation
that's Quotation
jolly. Quotation
Who's Quotation
going Quotation
to Quotation
give Quotation
it?" Quotation
"My Quotation
ma's Quotation
going Quotation
to Quotation
let Quotation
me Quotation
have Quotation
one." Quotation
"Oh, Quotation
goody; Quotation
I Quotation
hope Quotation
she'll Quotation
let Quotation
ME Quotation
come." Quotation
"Well, Quotation
she Quotation
will. Quotation
The Quotation
picnic's Quotation
for Quotation
me. Quotation
She'll Quotation
let Quotation
anybody Quotation
come Quotation
that Quotation
I Quotation
want, Quotation
and Quotation
I Quotation
want Quotation
you." Quotation
"That's Quotation
ever Quotation
so Quotation
nice. Quotation
When Quotation
is Quotation
it Quotation
going Quotation
to Quotation
be?" Quotation
"By Quotation
and Quotation
by. Quotation
Maybe Quotation
about Quotation
vacation." Quotation
"Oh, Quotation
won't Quotation
it Quotation
be Quotation
fun! Quotation
You Quotation
going Quotation
to Quotation
have Quotation
all Quotation
the Quotation
girls Quotation
and Quotation
boys?" Quotation
"Yes, Quotation
every Quotation
one Quotation
that's Quotation
friends Quotation
to Quotation
me-- Quotation
or Quotation
wants Quotation
to Quotation
be"; Quotation
and O
she Entity
glanced O
ever O
so O
furtively O
at O
Tom, Entity
but O
he O
talked Cue
right O
along O
to O
Amy Entity
Lawrence Entity
about O
the O
terrible O
storm O
on O
the O
island, O
and O
how O
the O
lightning O
tore O
the O
great O
sycamore O
tree O
"all Quotation
to Quotation
flinders" Quotation
while O
he O
was O
"standing Quotation
within Quotation
three Quotation
feet Quotation
of Quotation
it." Quotation
"Oh, Quotation
may Quotation
I Quotation
come?" Quotation
said Cue
Grace Entity
Miller. Entity
"Yes." Quotation
"And Quotation
me?" Quotation
said Cue
Sally Entity
Rogers. Entity
"Yes." Quotation
"And Quotation
me, Quotation
too?" Quotation
said Cue
Susy Entity
Harper. Entity
"And Quotation
Joe?" Quotation
"Yes." Quotation
And O
so O
on, O
with O
clapping O
of O
joyful O
hands O
till O
all O
the O
group O
had O
begged O
for O
invitations O
but O
Tom O
and O
Amy. O
Then O
Tom O
turned O
coolly O
away, O
still O
talking, O
and O
took O
Amy O
with O
him. O
Becky's O
lips O
trembled O
and O
the O
tears O
came O
to O
her O
eyes; O
she O
hid O
these O
signs O
with O
a O
forced O
gayety O
and O
went O
on O
chattering, O
but O
the O
life O
had O
gone O
out O
of O
the O
picnic, O
now, O
and O
out O
of O
everything O
else; O
she O
got O
away O
as O
soon O
as O
she O
could O
and O
hid O
herself O
and O
had O
what O
her O
sex O
call O
"a O
good O
cry." O
Then O
she O
sat O
moody, O
with O
wounded O
pride, O
till O
the O
bell O
rang. O
She O
roused O
up, O
now, O
with O
a O
vindictive O
cast O
in O
her O
eye, O
and O
gave O
her O
plaited O
tails O
a O
shake O
and O
said O
she O
knew O
what O
SHE'D O
do. O
At O
recess O
Tom O
continued O
his O
flirtation O
with O
Amy O
with O
jubilant O
self-satisfaction. O
And O
he O
kept O
drifting O
about O
to O
find O
Becky O
and O
lacerate O
her O
with O
the O
performance. O
At O
last O
he O
spied O
her, O
but O
there O
was O
a O
sudden O
falling O
of O
his O
mercury. O
She O
was O
sitting O
cosily O
on O
a O
little O
bench O
behind O
the O
schoolhouse O
looking O
at O
a O
picture-book O
with O
Alfred O
Temple-- O
and O
so O
absorbed O
were O
they, O
and O
their O
heads O
so O
close O
together O
over O
the O
book, O
that O
they O
did O
not O
seem O
to O
be O
conscious O
of O
anything O
in O
the O
world O
besides. O
Jealousy O
ran O
red-hot O
through O
Tom's O
veins. O
He O
began O
to O
hate O
himself O
for O
throwing O
away O
the O
chance O
Becky O
had O
offered O
for O
a O
reconciliation. O
He O
called O
himself O
a O
fool, O
and O
all O
the O
hard O
names O
he O
could O
think O
of. O
He O
wanted O
to O
cry O
with O
vexation. O
Amy O
chatted O
happily O
along, O
as O
they O
walked, O
for O
her O
heart O
was O
singing, O
but O
Tom's O
tongue O
had O
lost O
its O
function. O
He O
did O
not O
hear O
what O
Amy O
was O
saying, O
and O
whenever O
she O
paused O
expectantly O
he O
could O
only O
stammer O
an O
awkward O
assent, O
which O
was O
as O
often O
misplaced O
as O
otherwise. O
He O
kept O
drifting O
to O
the O
rear O
of O
the O
schoolhouse, O
again O
and O
again, O
to O
sear O
his O
eyeballs O
with O
the O
hateful O
spectacle O
there. O
He O
could O
not O
help O
it. O
And O
it O
maddened O
him O
to O
see, O
as O
he O
thought O
he O
saw, O
that O
Becky O
Thatcher O
never O
once O
suspected O
that O
he O
was O
even O
in O
the O
land O
of O
the O
living. O
But O
she O
did O
see, O
nevertheless; O
and O
she O
knew O
she O
was O
winning O
her O
fight, O
too, O
and O
was O
glad O
to O
see O
him O
suffer O
as O
she O
had O
suffered. O
Amy's O
happy O
prattle O
became O
intolerable. O
Tom O
hinted O
at O
things O
he O
had O
to O
attend O
to; O
things O
that O
must O
be O
done; O
and O
time O
was O
fleeting. O
But O
in O
vain-- O
the O
girl O
chirped O
on. O
Tom O
thought, O
"Oh, O
hang O
her, O
ain't O
I O
ever O
going O
to O
get O
rid O
of O
her?" O
At O
last O
he O
must O
be O
attending O
to O
those O
things-- O
and O
she O
said O
artlessly O
that O
she O
would O
be O
"around" O
when O
school O
let O
out. O
And O
he O
hastened O
away, O
hating O
her O
for O
it. O
"Any O
other O
boy!" O
Tom O
thought, O
grating O
his O
teeth. O
"Any O
boy O
in O
the O
whole O
town O
but O
that O
Saint O
Louis O
smarty O
that O
thinks O
he O
dresses O
so O
fine O
and O
is O
aristocracy! O
Oh, O
all O
right, O
I O
licked O
you O
the O
first O
day O
you O
ever O
saw O
this O
town, O
mister, O
and O
I'll O
lick O
you O
again! O
You O
just O
wait O
till O
I O
catch O
you O
out! O
I'll O
just O
take O
and O
-- O
" O
And O
he O
went O
through O
the O
motions O
of O
thrashing O
an O
imaginary O
boy O
--pummelling O
the O
air, O
and O
kicking O
and O
gouging. O
"Oh, O
you O
do, O
do O
you? O
You O
holler O
'nough, O
do O
you? O
Now, O
then, O
let O
that O
learn O
you!" O
And O
so O
the O
imaginary O
flogging O
was O
finished O
to O
his O
satisfaction. O
Tom O
fled O
home O
at O
noon. O
His O
conscience O
could O
not O
endure O
any O
more O
of O
Amy's O
grateful O
happiness, O
and O
his O
jealousy O
could O
bear O
no O
more O
of O
the O
other O
distress. O
Becky O
resumed O
her O
picture O
inspections O
with O
Alfred, O
but O
as O
the O
minutes O
dragged O
along O
and O
no O
Tom O
came O
to O
suffer, O
her O
triumph O
began O
to O
cloud O
and O
she O
lost O
interest; O
gravity O
and O
absent-mindedness O
followed, O
and O
then O
melancholy; O
two O
or O
three O
times O
she O
pricked O
up O
her O
ear O
at O
a O
footstep, O
but O
it O
was O
a O
false O
hope; O
no O
Tom O
came. O
At O
last O
she O
grew O
entirely O
miserable O
and O
wished O
she O
hadn't O
carried O
it O
so O
far. O
When O
poor Entity
Alfred, Entity
seeing O
that O
he O
was O
losing O
her, Entity
he O
did O
not O
know O
how, O
kept O
exclaiming: Cue
"Oh, Quotation
here's Quotation
a Quotation
jolly Quotation
one! Quotation
look Quotation
at Quotation
this!" Quotation
she Entity
lost O
patience O
at O
last, O
and O
said, Cue
"Oh, Quotation
don't Quotation
bother Quotation
me! Quotation
I Quotation
don't Quotation
care Quotation
for Quotation
them!" Quotation
and O
burst O
into O
tears, O
and O
got O
up O
and O
walked O
away. O
Alfred Entity
dropped O
alongside O
and O
was O
going O
to O
try O
to O
comfort O
her, O
but O
she Entity
said: Cue
"Go Quotation
away Quotation
and Quotation
leave Quotation
me Quotation
alone, Quotation
can't Quotation
you! Quotation
I Quotation
hate Quotation
you!" Quotation
So O
the O
boy O
halted, O
wondering O
what O
he O
could O
have O
done-- O
for O
she O
had O
said O
she O
would O
look O
at O
pictures O
all O
through O
the O
nooning-- O
and O
she O
walked O
on, O
crying. O
Then O
Alfred O
went O
musing O
into O
the O
deserted O
schoolhouse. O
He O
was O
humiliated O
and O
angry. O
He O
easily O
guessed O
his O
way O
to O
the O
truth-- O
the O
girl O
had O
simply O
made O
a O
convenience O
of O
him O
to O
vent O
her O
spite O
upon O
Tom O
Sawyer. O
He O
was O
far O
from O
hating O
Tom O
the O
less O
when O
this O
thought O
occurred O
to O
him. O
He O
wished O
there O
was O
some O
way O
to O
get O
that O
boy O
into O
trouble O
without O
much O
risk O
to O
himself. O
Tom's O
spelling-book O
fell O
under O
his O
eye. O
Here O
was O
his O
opportunity. O
He O
gratefully O
opened O
to O
the O
lesson O
for O
the O
afternoon O
and O
poured O
ink O
upon O
the O
page. O
Becky, O
glancing O
in O
at O
a O
window O
behind O
him O
at O
the O
moment, O
saw O
the O
act, O
and O
moved O
on, O
without O
discovering O
herself. O
She O
started O
homeward, O
now, O
intending O
to O
find O
Tom O
and O
tell O
him; O
Tom O
would O
be O
thankful O
and O
their O
troubles O
would O
be O
healed. O
Before O
she O
was O
half O
way O
home, O
however, O
she O
had O
changed O
her O
mind. O
The O
thought O
of O
Tom's O
treatment O
of O
her O
when O
she O
was O
talking O
about O
her O
picnic O
came O
scorching O
back O
and O
filled O
her O
with O
shame. O
She O
resolved O
to O
let O
him O
get O
whipped O
on O
the O
damaged O
spelling-book's O
account, O
and O
to O
hate O
him O
forever, O
into O
the O
bargain. O
CHAPTER O
XIX O
TOM O
arrived O
at O
home O
in O
a O
dreary O
mood, O
and O
the O
first O
thing O
his Entity
aunt Entity
said Cue
to O
him Entity
showed O
him O
that O
he O
had O
brought O
his O
sorrows O
to O
an O
unpromising O
market: O
"Tom, Quotation
I've Quotation
a Quotation
notion Quotation
to Quotation
skin Quotation
you Quotation
alive!" Quotation
"Auntie, Quotation
what Quotation
have Quotation
I Quotation
done?" Quotation
"Well, Quotation
you've Quotation
done Quotation
enough. Quotation
Here Quotation
I Quotation
go Quotation
over Quotation
to Quotation
Sereny Quotation
Harper, Quotation
like Quotation
an Quotation
old Quotation
softy, Quotation
expecting Quotation
I'm Quotation
going Quotation
to Quotation
make Quotation
her Quotation
believe Quotation
all Quotation
that Quotation
rubbage Quotation
about Quotation
that Quotation
dream, Quotation
when Quotation
lo Quotation
and Quotation
behold Quotation
you Quotation
she'd Quotation
found Quotation
out Quotation
from Quotation
Joe Quotation
that Quotation
you Quotation
was Quotation
over Quotation
here Quotation
and Quotation
heard Quotation
all Quotation
the Quotation
talk Quotation
we Quotation
had Quotation
that Quotation
night. Quotation
Tom, Quotation
I Quotation
don't Quotation
know Quotation
what Quotation
is Quotation
to Quotation
become Quotation
of Quotation
a Quotation
boy Quotation
that Quotation
will Quotation
act Quotation
like Quotation
that. Quotation
It Quotation
makes Quotation
me Quotation
feel Quotation
so Quotation
bad Quotation
to Quotation
think Quotation
you Quotation
could Quotation
let Quotation
me Quotation
go Quotation
to Quotation
Sereny Quotation
Harper Quotation
and Quotation
make Quotation
such Quotation
a Quotation
fool Quotation
of Quotation
myself Quotation
and Quotation
never Quotation
say Quotation
a Quotation
word." Quotation
This O
was O
a O
new O
aspect O
of O
the O
thing. O
His O
smartness O
of O
the O
morning O
had O
seemed O
to O
Tom O
a O
good O
joke O
before, O
and O
very O
ingenious. O
It O
merely O
looked O
mean O
and O
shabby O
now. O
He O
hung O
his O
head O
and O
could O
not O
think O
of O
anything O
to O
say O
for O
a O
moment. O
Then O
he Entity
said: Cue
"Auntie, Quotation
I Quotation
wish Quotation
I Quotation
hadn't Quotation
done Quotation
it-- Quotation
but Quotation
I Quotation
didn't Quotation
think." Quotation
"Oh, Quotation
child, Quotation
you Quotation
never Quotation
think. Quotation
You Quotation
never Quotation
think Quotation
of Quotation
anything Quotation
but Quotation
your Quotation
own Quotation
selfishness. Quotation
You Quotation
could Quotation
think Quotation
to Quotation
come Quotation
all Quotation
the Quotation
way Quotation
over Quotation
here Quotation
from Quotation
Jackson's Quotation
Island Quotation
in Quotation
the Quotation
night Quotation
to Quotation
laugh Quotation
at Quotation
our Quotation
troubles, Quotation
and Quotation
you Quotation
could Quotation
think Quotation
to Quotation
fool Quotation
me Quotation
with Quotation
a Quotation
lie Quotation
about Quotation
a Quotation
dream; Quotation
but Quotation
you Quotation
couldn't Quotation
ever Quotation
think Quotation
to Quotation
pity Quotation
us Quotation
and Quotation
save Quotation
us Quotation
from Quotation
sorrow." Quotation
"Auntie, Quotation
I Quotation
know Quotation
now Quotation
it Quotation
was Quotation
mean, Quotation
but Quotation
I Quotation
didn't Quotation
mean Quotation
to Quotation
be Quotation
mean. Quotation
I Quotation
didn't, Quotation
honest. Quotation
And Quotation
besides, Quotation
I Quotation
didn't Quotation
come Quotation
over Quotation
here Quotation
to Quotation
laugh Quotation
at Quotation
you Quotation
that Quotation
night." Quotation
"What Quotation
did Quotation
you Quotation
come Quotation
for, Quotation
then?" Quotation
"It Quotation
was Quotation
to Quotation
tell Quotation
you Quotation
not Quotation
to Quotation
be Quotation
uneasy Quotation
about Quotation
us, Quotation
because Quotation
we Quotation
hadn't Quotation
got Quotation
drownded." Quotation
"Tom, Quotation
Tom, Quotation
I Quotation
would Quotation
be Quotation
the Quotation
thankfullest Quotation
soul Quotation
in Quotation
this Quotation
world Quotation
if Quotation
I Quotation
could Quotation
believe Quotation
you Quotation
ever Quotation
had Quotation
as Quotation
good Quotation
a Quotation
thought Quotation
as Quotation
that, Quotation
but Quotation
you Quotation
know Quotation
you Quotation
never Quotation
did-- Quotation
and Quotation
I Quotation
know Quotation
it, Quotation
Tom." Quotation
"Indeed Quotation
and Quotation
'deed Quotation
I Quotation
did, Quotation
auntie Quotation
-- Quotation
I Quotation
wish Quotation
I Quotation
may Quotation
never Quotation
stir Quotation
if Quotation
I Quotation
didn't." Quotation
"Oh, Quotation
Tom, Quotation
don't Quotation
lie-- Quotation
don't Quotation
do Quotation
it. Quotation
It Quotation
only Quotation
makes Quotation
things Quotation
a Quotation
hundred Quotation
times Quotation
worse." Quotation
"It Quotation
ain't Quotation
a Quotation
lie, Quotation
auntie; Quotation
it's Quotation
the Quotation
truth. Quotation
I Quotation
wanted Quotation
to Quotation
keep Quotation
you Quotation
from Quotation
grieving-- Quotation
that Quotation
was Quotation
all Quotation
that Quotation
made Quotation
me Quotation
come." Quotation
"I'd Quotation
give Quotation
the Quotation
whole Quotation
world Quotation
to Quotation
believe Quotation
that-- Quotation
it Quotation
would Quotation
cover Quotation
up Quotation
a Quotation
power Quotation
of Quotation
sins, Quotation
Tom. Quotation
I'd Quotation
'most Quotation
be Quotation
glad Quotation
you'd Quotation
run Quotation
off Quotation
and Quotation
acted Quotation
so Quotation
bad. Quotation
But Quotation
it Quotation
ain't Quotation
reasonable; Quotation
because, Quotation
why Quotation
didn't Quotation
you Quotation
tell Quotation
me, Quotation
child?" Quotation
"Why, Quotation
you Quotation
see, Quotation
when Quotation
you Quotation
got Quotation
to Quotation
talking Quotation
about Quotation
the Quotation
funeral, Quotation
I Quotation
just Quotation
got Quotation
all Quotation
full Quotation
of Quotation
the Quotation
idea Quotation
of Quotation
our Quotation
coming Quotation
and Quotation
hiding Quotation
in Quotation
the Quotation
church, Quotation
and Quotation
I Quotation
couldn't Quotation
somehow Quotation
bear Quotation
to Quotation
spoil Quotation
it. Quotation
So Quotation
I Quotation
just Quotation
put Quotation
the Quotation
bark Quotation
back Quotation
in Quotation
my Quotation
pocket Quotation
and Quotation
kept Quotation
mum." Quotation
"What Quotation
bark?" Quotation
"The Quotation
bark Quotation
I Quotation
had Quotation
wrote Quotation
on Quotation
to Quotation
tell Quotation
you Quotation
we'd Quotation
gone Quotation
pirating. Quotation
I Quotation
wish, Quotation
now, Quotation
you'd Quotation
waked Quotation
up Quotation
when Quotation
I Quotation
kissed Quotation
you Quotation
-- Quotation
I Quotation
do, Quotation
honest." Quotation
The O
hard O
lines O
in O
his Entity
aunt's O
face O
relaxed O
and O
a O
sudden O
tenderness O
dawned O
in O
her O
eyes. O
"DID O
you O
kiss O
me, O
Tom?" O
"Why, O
yes, O
I O
did." O
"Are O
you O
sure O
you O
did, O
Tom?" O
"Why, O
yes, O
I O
did, O
auntie-- O
certain O
sure." O
"What O
did O
you O
kiss O
me O
for, O
Tom?" O
"Because O
I O
loved O
you O
so, O
and O
you O
laid O
there O
moaning O
and O
I O
was O
so O
sorry." O
The O
words O
sounded O
like O
truth. O
The O
old O
lady O
could O
not O
hide O
a O
tremor O
in O
her O
voice O
when O
she O
said: O
"Kiss O
me O
again, O
Tom!-- O
and O
be O
off O
with O
you O
to O
school, O
now, O
and O
don't O
bother O
me O
any O
more." O
The O
moment O
he O
was O
gone, O
she O
ran O
to O
a O
closet O
and O
got O
out O
the O
ruin O
of O
a O
jacket O
which O
Tom O
had O
gone O
pirating O
in. O
Then O
she O
stopped, O
with O
it O
in O
her O
hand, O
and O
said O
to O
herself: O
"No, O
I O
don't O
dare. O
Poor O
boy, O
I O
reckon O
he's O
lied O
about O
it-- O
but O
it's O
a O
blessed, O
blessed O
lie, O
there's O
such O
a O
comfort O
come O
from O
it. O
I O
hope O
the O
Lord O
-- O
I O
KNOW O
the O
Lord O
will O
forgive O
him, O
because O
it O
was O
such O
goodheartedness O
in O
him O
to O
tell O
it. O
But O
I O
don't O
want O
to O
find O
out O
it's O
a O
lie. O
I O
won't O
look." O
She O
put O
the O
jacket O
away, O
and O
stood O
by O
musing O
a O
minute. O
Twice O
she O
put O
out O
her O
hand O
to O
take O
the O
garment O
again, O
and O
twice O
she O
refrained. O
Once O
more O
she O
ventured, O
and O
this O
time O
she O
fortified O
herself O
with O
the O
thought: O
"It's O
a O
good O
lie-- O
it's O
a O
good O
lie O
-- O
I O
won't O
let O
it O
grieve O
me." O
So O
she O
sought O
the O
jacket O
pocket. O
A O
moment O
later O
she O
was O
reading O
Tom's O
piece O
of O
bark O
through O
flowing O
tears O
and O
saying: O
"I O
could O
forgive O
the O
boy, O
now, O
if O
he'd O
committed O
a O
million O
sins!" O
CHAPTER O
XX O
THERE O
was O
something O
about O
Aunt O
Polly's O
manner, O
when O
she O
kissed O
Tom, O
that O
swept O
away O
his O
low O
spirits O
and O
made O
him O
lighthearted O
and O
happy O
again. O
He O
started O
to O
school O
and O
had O
the O
luck O
of O
coming O
upon O
Becky O
Thatcher O
at O
the O
head O
of O
Meadow O
Lane. O
His O
mood O
always O
determined O
his O
manner. O
Without O
a O
moment's O
hesitation O
he O
ran O
to O
her O
and O
said: O
"I O
acted O
mighty O
mean O
to-day, O
Becky, O
and O
I'm O
so O
sorry. O
I O
won't O
ever, O
ever O
do O
that O
way O
again, O
as O
long O
as O
ever O
I O
live-- O
please O
make O
up, O
won't O
you?" O
The O
girl O
stopped O
and O
looked O
him O
scornfully O
in O
the O
face: O
"I'll O
thank O
you O
to O
keep O
yourself O
TO O
yourself, O
Mr. O
Thomas O
Sawyer. O
I'll O
never O
speak O
to O
you O
again." O
She O
tossed O
her O
head O
and O
passed O
on. O
Tom O
was O
so O
stunned O
that O
he O
had O
not O
even O
presence O
of O
mind O
enough O
to O
say O
"Who O
cares, O
Miss O
Smarty?" O
until O
the O
right O
time O
to O
say O
it O
had O
gone O
by. O
So O
he O
said O
nothing. O
But O
he O
was O
in O
a O
fine O
rage, O
nevertheless. O
He O
moped O
into O
the O
schoolyard O
wishing O
she O
were O
a O
boy, O
and O
imagining O
how O
he O
would O
trounce O
her O
if O
she O
were. O
He O
presently O
encountered O
her O
and O
delivered O
a O
stinging O
remark O
as O
he O
passed. O
She O
hurled O
one O
in O
return, O
and O
the O
angry O
breach O
was O
complete. O
It O
seemed O
to O
Becky, O
in O
her O
hot O
resentment, O
that O
she O
could O
hardly O
wait O
for O
school O
to O
"take O
in," O
she O
was O
so O
impatient O
to O
see O
Tom O
flogged O
for O
the O
injured O
spelling-book. O
If O
she O
had O
had O
any O
lingering O
notion O
of O
exposing O
Alfred O
Temple, O
Tom's O
offensive O
fling O
had O
driven O
it O
entirely O
away. O
Poor O
girl, O
she O
did O
not O
know O
how O
fast O
she O
was O
nearing O
trouble O
herself. O
The O
master, O
Mr. O
Dobbins, O
had O
reached O
middle O
age O
with O
an O
unsatisfied O
ambition. O
The O
darling O
of O
his O
desires O
was, O
to O
be O
a O
doctor, O
but O
poverty O
had O
decreed O
that O
he O
should O
be O
nothing O
higher O
than O
a O
village O
schoolmaster. O
Every O
day O
he O
took O
a O
mysterious O
book O
out O
of O
his O
desk O
and O
absorbed O
himself O
in O
it O
at O
times O
when O
no O
classes O
were O
reciting. O
He O
kept O
that O
book O
under O
lock O
and O
key. O
There O
was O
not O
an O
urchin O
in O
school O
but O
was O
perishing O
to O
have O
a O
glimpse O
of O
it, O
but O
the O
chance O
never O
came. O
Every O
boy O
and O
girl O
had O
a O
theory O
about O
the O
nature O
of O
that O
book; O
but O
no O
two O
theories O
were O
alike, O
and O
there O
was O
no O
way O
of O
getting O
at O
the O
facts O
in O
the O
case. O
Now, O
as O
Becky O
was O
passing O
by O
the O
desk, O
which O
stood O
near O
the O
door, O
she O
noticed O
that O
the O
key O
was O
in O
the O
lock! O
It O
was O
a O
precious O
moment. O
She O
glanced O
around; O
found O
herself O
alone, O
and O
the O
next O
instant O
she O
had O
the O
book O
in O
her O
hands. O
The O
title-page-- O
Professor O
Somebody's O
ANATOMY-- O
carried O
no O
information O
to O
her O
mind; O
so O
she O
began O
to O
turn O
the O
leaves. O
She O
came O
at O
once O
upon O
a O
handsomely O
engraved O
and O
colored O
frontispiece O
-- O
a O
human O
figure, O
stark O
naked. O
At O
that O
moment O
a O
shadow O
fell O
on O
the O
page O
and O
Tom O
Sawyer O
stepped O
in O
at O
the O
door O
and O
caught O
a O
glimpse O
of O
the O
picture. O
Becky O
snatched O
at O
the O
book O
to O
close O
it, O
and O
had O
the O
hard O
luck O
to O
tear O
the O
pictured O
page O
half O
down O
the O
middle. O
She O
thrust O
the O
volume O
into O
the O
desk, O
turned O
the O
key, O
and O
burst O
out O
crying O
with O
shame O
and O
vexation. O
"Tom O
Sawyer, O
you O
are O
just O
as O
mean O
as O
you O
can O
be, O
to O
sneak O
up O
on O
a O
person O
and O
look O
at O
what O
they're O
looking O
at." O
"How O
could O
I O
know O
you O
was O
looking O
at O
anything?" O
"You O
ought O
to O
be O
ashamed O
of O
yourself, O
Tom O
Sawyer; O
you O
know O
you're O
going O
to O
tell O
on O
me, O
and O
oh, O
what O
shall O
I O
do, O
what O
shall O
I O
do! O
I'll O
be O
whipped, O
and O
I O
never O
was O
whipped O
in O
school." O
Then O
she O
stamped O
her O
little O
foot O
and O
said: O
"BE O
so O
mean O
if O
you O
want O
to! O
I O
know O
something O
that's O
going O
to O
happen. O
You O
just O
wait O
and O
you'll O
see! O
Hateful, O
hateful, O
hateful!"-- O
and O
she O
flung O
out O
of O
the O
house O
with O
a O
new O
explosion O
of O
crying. O
Tom O
stood O
still, O
rather O
flustered O
by O
this O
onslaught. O
Presently O
he O
said O
to O
himself: O
"What O
a O
curious O
kind O
of O
a O
fool O
a O
girl O
is! O
Never O
been O
licked O
in O
school! O
Shucks! O
What's O
a O
licking! O
That's O
just O
like O
a O
girl-- O
they're O
so O
thin-skinned O
and O
chicken-hearted. O
Well, O
of O
course O
I O
ain't O
going O
to O
tell O
old O
Dobbins O
on O
this O
little O
fool, O
because O
there's O
other O
ways O
of O
getting O
even O
on O
her, O
that O
ain't O
so O
mean; O
but O
what O
of O
it? O
Old O
Dobbins O
will O
ask O
who O
it O
was O
tore O
his O
book. O
Nobody'll O
answer. O
Then O
he'll O
do O
just O
the O
way O
he O
always O
does-- O
ask O
first O
one O
and O
then O
t'other, O
and O
when O
he O
comes O
to O
the O
right O
girl O
he'll O
know O
it, O
without O
any O
telling. O
Girls' O
faces O
always O
tell O
on O
them. O
They O
ain't O
got O
any O
backbone. O
She'll O
get O
licked. O
Well, O
it's O
a O
kind O
of O
a O
tight O
place O
for O
Becky O
Thatcher, O
because O
there O
ain't O
any O
way O
out O
of O
it." O
Tom O
conned O
the O
thing O
a O
moment O
longer, O
and O
then O
added: O
"All O
right, O
though; O
she'd O
like O
to O
see O
me O
in O
just O
such O
a O
fix-- O
let O
her O
sweat O
it O
out!" O
Tom O
joined O
the O
mob O
of O
skylarking O
scholars O
outside. O
In O
a O
few O
moments O
the O
master O
arrived O
and O
school O
"took O
in." O
Tom O
did O
not O
feel O
a O
strong O
interest O
in O
his O
studies. O
Every O
time O
he O
stole O
a O
glance O
at O
the O
girls' O
side O
of O
the O
room O
Becky's O
face O
troubled O
him. O
Considering O
all O
things, O
he O
did O
not O
want O
to O
pity O
her, O
and O
yet O
it O
was O
all O
he O
could O
do O
to O
help O
it. O
He O
could O
get O
up O
no O
exultation O
that O
was O
really O
worthy O
the O
name. O
Presently O
the O
spelling-book O
discovery O
was O
made, O
and O
Tom's O
mind O
was O
entirely O
full O
of O
his O
own O
matters O
for O
a O
while O
after O
that. O
Becky O
roused O
up O
from O
her O
lethargy O
of O
distress O
and O
showed O
good O
interest O
in O
the O
proceedings. O
She O
did O
not O
expect O
that O
Tom O
could O
get O
out O
of O
his O
trouble O
by O
denying O
that O
he O
spilt O
the O
ink O
on O
the O
book O
himself; O
and O
she O
was O
right. O
The O
denial O
only O
seemed O
to O
make O
the O
thing O
worse O
for O
Tom. O
Becky O
supposed O
she O
would O
be O
glad O
of O
that, O
and O
she O
tried O
to O
believe O
she O
was O
glad O
of O
it, O
but O
she O
found O
she O
was O
not O
certain. O
When O
the O
worst O
came O
to O
the O
worst, O
she O
had O
an O
impulse O
to O
get O
up O
and O
tell O
on O
Alfred O
Temple, O
but O
she O
made O
an O
effort O
and O
forced O
herself O
to O
keep O
still-- O
because, O
said O
she O
to O
herself, O
"he'll O
tell O
about O
me O
tearing O
the O
picture O
sure. O
I O
wouldn't O
say O
a O
word, O
not O
to O
save O
his O
life!" O
Tom O
took O
his O
whipping O
and O
went O
back O
to O
his O
seat O
not O
at O
all O
broken-hearted, O
for O
he O
thought O
it O
was O
possible O
that O
he O
had O
unknowingly O
upset O
the O
ink O
on O
the O
spelling-book O
himself, O
in O
some O
skylarking O
bout-- O
he O
had O
denied O
it O
for O
form's O
sake O
and O
because O
it O
was O
custom, O
and O
had O
stuck O
to O
the O
denial O
from O
principle. O
A O
whole O
hour O
drifted O
by, O
the O
master O
sat O
nodding O
in O
his O
throne, O
the O
air O
was O
drowsy O
with O
the O
hum O
of O
study. O
By O
and O
by, O
Mr. O
Dobbins O
straightened O
himself O
up, O
yawned, O
then O
unlocked O
his O
desk, O
and O
reached O
for O
his O
book, O
but O
seemed O
undecided O
whether O
to O
take O
it O
out O
or O
leave O
it. O
Most O
of O
the O
pupils O
glanced O
up O
languidly, O
but O
there O
were O
two O
among O
them O
that O
watched O
his O
movements O
with O
intent O
eyes. O
Mr. O
Dobbins O
fingered O
his O
book O
absently O
for O
a O
while, O
then O
took O
it O
out O
and O
settled O
himself O
in O
his O
chair O
to O
read! O
Tom O
shot O
a O
glance O
at O
Becky. O
He O
had O
seen O
a O
hunted O
and O
helpless O
rabbit O
look O
as O
she O
did, O
with O
a O
gun O
levelled O
at O
its O
head. O
Instantly O
he O
forgot O
his O
quarrel O
with O
her. O
Quick-- O
something O
must O
be O
done! O
done O
in O
a O
flash, O
too! O
But O
the O
very O
imminence O
of O
the O
emergency O
paralyzed O
his O
invention. O
Good!-- O
he O
had O
an O
inspiration! O
He O
would O
run O
and O
snatch O
the O
book, O
spring O
through O
the O
door O
and O
fly. O
But O
his O
resolution O
shook O
for O
one O
little O
instant, O
and O
the O
chance O
was O
lost-- O
the O
master O
opened O
the O
volume. O
If O
Tom O
only O
had O
the O
wasted O
opportunity O
back O
again! O
Too O
late. O
There O
was O
no O
help O
for O
Becky O
now, O
he O
said. O
The O
next O
moment O
the O
master O
faced O
the O
school. O
Every O
eye O
sank O
under O
his O
gaze. O
There O
was O
that O
in O
it O
which O
smote O
even O
the O
innocent O
with O
fear. O
There O
was O
silence O
while O
one O
might O
count O
ten O
--the O
master O
was O
gathering O
his O
wrath. O
Then O
he O
spoke: O
"Who O
tore O
this O
book?" O
There O
was O
not O
a O
sound. O
One O
could O
have O
heard O
a O
pin O
drop. O
The O
stillness O
continued; O
the O
master O
searched O
face O
after O
face O
for O
signs O
of O
guilt. O
"Benjamin O
Rogers, O
did O
you O
tear O
this O
book?" O
A O
denial. O
Another O
pause. O
"Joseph O
Harper, O
did O
you?" O
Another O
denial. O
Tom's O
uneasiness O
grew O
more O
and O
more O
intense O
under O
the O
slow O
torture O
of O
these O
proceedings. O
The O
master O
scanned O
the O
ranks O
of O
boys-- O
considered O
a O
while, O
then O
turned O
to O
the O
girls: O
"Amy O
Lawrence?" O
A O
shake O
of O
the O
head. O
"Gracie O
Miller?" O
The O
same O
sign. O
"Susan O
Harper, O
did O
you O
do O
this?" O
Another O
negative. O
The O
next O
girl O
was O
Becky O
Thatcher. O
Tom O
was O
trembling O
from O
head O
to O
foot O
with O
excitement O
and O
a O
sense O
of O
the O
hopelessness O
of O
the O
situation. O
"Rebecca O
Thatcher" O
[Tom O
glanced O
at O
her O
face-- O
it O
was O
white O
with O
terror] O
--"did O
you O
tear-- O
no, O
look O
me O
in O
the O
face" O
[her O
hands O
rose O
in O
appeal] O
--"did O
you O
tear O
this O
book?" O
A O
thought O
shot O
like O
lightning O
through O
Tom's O
brain. O
He O
sprang O
to O
his O
feet O
and O
shouted-- O
"I O
done O
it!" O
The O
school O
stared O
in O
perplexity O
at O
this O
incredible O
folly. O
Tom O
stood O
a O
moment, O
to O
gather O
his O
dismembered O
faculties; O
and O
when O
he O
stepped O
forward O
to O
go O
to O
his O
punishment O
the O
surprise, O
the O
gratitude, O
the O
adoration O
that O
shone O
upon O
him O
out O
of O
poor O
Becky's O
eyes O
seemed O
pay O
enough O
for O
a O
hundred O
floggings. O
Inspired O
by O
the O
splendor O
of O
his O
own O
act, O
he O
took O
without O
an O
outcry O
the O
most O
merciless O
flaying O
that O
even O
Mr. O
Dobbins O
had O
ever O
administered; O
and O
also O
received O
with O
indifference O
the O
added O
cruelty O
of O
a O
command O
to O
remain O
two O
hours O
after O
school O
should O
be O
dismissed-- O
for O
he O
knew O
who O
would O
wait O
for O
him O
outside O
till O
his O
captivity O
was O
done, O
and O
not O
count O
the O
tedious O
time O
as O
loss, O
either. O
Tom O
went O
to O
bed O
that O
night O
planning O
vengeance O
against O
Alfred O
Temple; O
for O
with O
shame O
and O
repentance O
Becky O
had O
told O
him O
all, O
not O
forgetting O
her O
own O
treachery; O
but O
even O
the O
longing O
for O
vengeance O
had O
to O
give O
way, O
soon, O
to O
pleasanter O
musings, O
and O
he O
fell O
asleep O
at O
last O
with O
Becky's O
latest O
words O
lingering O
dreamily O
in O
his O
ear-- O
"Tom, O
how O
COULD O
you O
be O
so O
noble!" O
